Saint Columban, Latin Columbanus,  (born c. 543, Leinster [Ireland]—died  Nov. 23, 615, Bobbio [Italy]; feast day November 23), abbot and writer, one of the greatest missionaries of the Celtic church, who initiated a revival of spirituality on the European continent.
Educated in the monastery of Bangor, County Down, Columban left Ireland about 590 with 12 monks (including Saints Attala, Gall, and Columbanus the Younger) and established himself in the Vosges Mountains at Annegray, then in Gaul. For the disciples who came to follow his rule, Columban built the nearby monasteries of Luxovium and Fontaines.
Unpopular because of his attacks on degeneracy in the Burgundian court and among local clergy, he was indicted before a synod of French bishops (603) for keeping Easter according to the Celtic usage, whereupon he wrote Pope Gregory I for aid. A powerful conspiracy was organized against him at the court of King Theodoric II. Forcibly removed from his monastery at Luxovium (610), he went with Gall and other monks to Switzerland, where he preached to the Alemanni, a pagan Germanic people. Compelled to leave, he went to Italy and founded the monastery of Bobbio (c. 612–614).
Columban’s works include poems, letters, sermons, a rule, and a penitential, proving him a man of learning acquainted with Latin and Greek classics; his writings were edited by G.S.M. Walker, with an introduction and English translation (1957).
