St. Robert of Molesme,  (born c. 1027, Troyes, Champagne [France]—died 1110, Molesme, Burgundy; canonized 1222; feast day April 29), French Benedictine monk and abbot, monastic reformer, and founder of Cîteaux (Latin: Cistercium) Abbey (1098), which developed into the Cistercian Order.
The son of noble parents, Robert entered the Benedictine monastery of Moutier-la-Celle near Troyes as a youth and soon became prior. He later became abbot of Saint-Michel-de-Tonnerre, near Langres, where he attempted reforms with little success. He eventually accepted the request of some hermits to become their leader, and in 1075 they established themselves at Molesme. Their austere life gradually gave way to prosperity and laxity, and in 1098 Robert and about 20 monks withdrew to establish Cîteaux, where they strictly followed St. Benedict’s Rule.
In 1099 Robert agreed to return to Molesme, as the monks there had consented to submit to his leadership. St. Alberic was made successor abbot at Cîteaux, with St. Stephen Harding as prior, and the Cistercian rule and order were formalized under their guidance. Robert died as abbot of Molesme, having transformed it into a major centre of Benedictine monasticism and reform.
