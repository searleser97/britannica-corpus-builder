Armand-Jean Le Bouthillier de Rancé,  (born January 9, 1626, Paris, France—died October 27, 1700, Soligny-la-Trappe), French abbot who revived the Cistercian abbey of La Trappe, influenced the establishment of several important monasteries, and founded the reformed Cistercians, called Trappists, a community practicing extreme austerity of diet, penitential exercises, and, except for chanting, absolute silence.
Of noble birth, Rancé became commendatory abbot (a benefice granted to a secular clerk for life) of La Trappe. Between 1657 and 1660 he turned from a worldly to a spiritual life, giving up his possessions and benefices.In 1664 he became regular abbot of La Trappe and devoted himself to reforming the Cistercian order. In 1678 Rancé obtained papal approval of his reform, which spread widely.
His staunchness, the physical and psychological demands he made upon his followers (he regarded ugliness and squalor as integral to poverty), and his outspoken criticism of less austere religious orders provoked hostility, however, and led him into a heated controversy with the learned French Maurist (Benedictine scholar) Jean Mabillon. In his Traité de la sainteté et des devoirs de la vie monastique (1683; “Treatise on the Holiness and the Duties of the Monastic Life”), Rancé attacked learning—the central activity of the Maurists—as being contrary to the spirit of monastic life, which he believed should be confined to prayer and manual labour.
Suffering ill health, he resigned his abbacy in 1695.
