Thierry de Chartres, also called Thierry the Breton, Latin Theodoricus, or Terricus, Carnotensis, or Brito,  (born c. 1100, France—died c. 1150, Chartres, Fr.), French theologian, teacher, encyclopaedist, one of the foremost thinkers of the 12th century.
According to Peter Abelard, Thierry attended the Council of Soissons in 1121, at which Abelard’s teachings were condemned. He taught at Chartres, where his brother Bernard of Chartres, a celebrated Platonist, was chancellor. Sometime after 1136 he began teaching in Paris, where he had the Latinist, John of Salisbury, among his pupils. In 1141 he became archdeacon and chancellor of Chartres. After attending the Diet of Frankfurt in 1149, he later retired to a monastic life.
His unpublished Heptateuchon (“Book in Seven Volumes”) contains the “classics” of the seven liberal arts, including works by Cicero on rhetoric and by Aristotle on logic. His cosmology, mainly expounded in his commentary on Genesis, attempts to harmonize Scripture with Platonic and other physical or metaphysical doctrines; it teaches that God—who is everything—is the ultimate form from which all other forms were created. In the Latin West, he was among the first to promote the Arabian knowledge of science, thus contributing to that important movement beginning in the 11th century in which Eastern science was—through Latin translations of Arabic works—introduced into the West, where science had disappeared with the Latin Roman Empire.
