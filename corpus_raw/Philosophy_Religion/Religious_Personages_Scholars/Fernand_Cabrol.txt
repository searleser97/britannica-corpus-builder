Fernand Cabrol,  (born Dec. 11, 1855, Marseille—died  June 4, 1937, Farnborough, Hampshire, Eng.), Benedictine monk and noted writer on the history of Christian worship.
Cabrol took his monastic vows in 1877 and was ordained in 1882. In 1896 he was sent as prior to the monastery at Farnborough and was elected abbot (1903), an office he held until his death.
One of the most important of Cabrol’s works was his widely circulated Livre de la prière antique (1900; Liturgical Prayer, 1922). Monumenta ecclesiae liturgica was the title of an ambitious series begun by Cabrol, of which only three volumes were published. He also completed the first volume (1907) of a project launched in 1903, the Dictionnaire d’archéologie chrétienne et de liturgie (co-edited by D. Henri Leclerq). He wrote a number of lesser works, mostly on liturgy.
