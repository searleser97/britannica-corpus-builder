John Bastwick,  (born 1593, Writtle, Essex, Eng.—died September/October 1654), English religious zealot who, in the reign of Charles I, opposed the liturgical and ecclesial reforms introduced by Archbishop William Laud into the Church of England, reforms that Bastwick believed to represent a return to “popery.”
After a brief education at Cambridge, he wandered on the Continent and graduated in medicine at Padua, Italy. On his return he settled in Colchester. About 1633 he printed in the Netherlands two Latin treatises, entitled Elenchus Religionis Papisticae and Flagellum Pontificis et Episcoporum Latialium; and because William Laud and other English prelates thought themselves the target of the treatises, he was fined, excommunicated, and prohibited from practicing medicine; his books were burned, and he was consigned to prison. His counterblast was Apologeticus ad Praesules Anglicanos and another book, in English, The Litany, in which he charged the bishops with being the enemies of God and “the tail of the beast.” Bastwick, William Prynne, and Henry Burton came under the lash of the Star Chamber court at the same time; they were all censured as turbulent and seditious persons and condemned to pay a fine of £5,000 each, to be set in the pillory, to lose their ears, and to undergo imprisonment for life in remote parts of the kingdom, Bastwick being sent to Scilly. The Parliament in 1640 reversed these proceedings and ordered Bastwick a reparation of £5,000 out of the estates of the commissioners and lords who had sentenced him. During the English Civil Wars he joined the Parliamentary army but in later years showed bitter opposition to the Independents.
