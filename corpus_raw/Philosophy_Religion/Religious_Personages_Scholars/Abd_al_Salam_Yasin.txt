ʿAbd al-Salām Yāsīn,  (born 1928, Marrakesh, Morocco—died December 13, 2012), Moroccan religious leader. A former school inspector fluent in English and French, he began practicing Sufism in the 1960s. By the early 1970s he had adopted a more political view of Islam and was influenced by the writings of the Egyptian Islamists Ḥasan al-Bannā and Sayyid Quṭb. After sending a lengthy open letter to the king of Morocco advocating the establishment of an Islamic state—a consistent theme in his work—he was confined to a mental institution (1974–77). In 1986 he founded a movement known as al-ʿAdl wa al-Iḥsān (Arabic: “Justice and Charity”), which became one of the most prominent elements of Morocco’s Islamic opposition. Yāsīn was held under house arrest from 1989 to 2000.
