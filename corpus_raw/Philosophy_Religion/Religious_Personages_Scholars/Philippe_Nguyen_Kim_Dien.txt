Philippe Nguyen Kim Dien,  (born March 13, 1921, Long Duc, Vinh Long province, Vietnam—died  June 8, 1988, Ho Chi Minh City), Vietnamese prelate, archbishop of Hue and local leader of the Roman Catholic church who defied government efforts to control the church after Vietnam’s reunification (1976).
Dien, who was ordained in 1947, was appointed bishop of Cantho (1961), archbishop of Pario (1964), and archbishop of Hue (1968). After reunification he kept the Roman Catholic community together, despite seminary closures and the forced “reeducation” of many priests. In 1983 the government formed the Committee for the Solidarity of Patriotic Vietnamese Catholics in an attempt to separate the Vietnamese Roman Catholic church from papal authority. For opposition to this committee, Dien was placed under house arrest from 1984 until his death in 1988. Cardinals and bishops from 40 countries issued a formal protest when Dien was prevented from attending the 1986 Vatican Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples.
