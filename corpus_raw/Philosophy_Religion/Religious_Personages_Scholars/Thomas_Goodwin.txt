Thomas Goodwin,  (born Oct. 5, 1600, Rollesby, Norfolk, Eng.—died  Feb. 23, 1680, London?), English Puritan clergyman and a chaplain to Oliver Cromwell who helped draft a confession of faith for Congregationalism.
He graduated in 1616 from Christ’s College, Cambridge, where from 1632 to 1634 he was vicar of Trinity Church. Because of Archbishop William Laud’s persecution of Puritans, Goodwin left England in 1639 and lived for a time at Arnhem, Holland. After his return in 1640, he embraced the Independent, or Congregational, form of church government as the middle way between the Puritan extremes, Presbyterianism on the right, Sectarianism on the left.
Goodwin helped draft the Savoy Declaration of 1658, a confession of faith for Congregationalism. From 1649, the first year of Oliver Cromwell’s Commonwealth, until the end of the Protectorate nine years later, Goodwin headed Magdalen College, Oxford, also serving as an official at the trials of heretical ministers. As chaplain to Cromwell, Goodwin reportedly told him at his deathbed that he was assured of salvation. Goodwin devoted his last years to study and writing; he was the author of five volumes of Works, collected and published posthumously (1681–1704).
