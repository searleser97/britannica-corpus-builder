David Calderwood,  (born 1575—died October 29, 1650, Jedburgh, Roxburghshire [now Scottish Borders], Scotland), Scottish Presbyterian minister and historian of the Church of Scotland.
About 1604 Calderwood became minister of Crailing, near Jedburgh, Roxburghshire (now Scottish Borders). When King James I later attempted to introduce prelacy (government by king and bishops and other prelates) into the Church of Scotland, Calderwood demonstrated his opposition and came under fire. In 1617 a group of clerics siding with Calderwood signed a protest against a decree giving royalist-episcopal control over the church. Calderwood was summoned to a commission at St. Andrews and examined before the king (who called him a “puritan”), but neither threats nor promises could make him deliver up the roll of signatures to the remonstrance. The king’s Privy Council ordered him to be banished from the kingdom for refusing to acknowledge the sentence of the high commission. On August 27, 1619, he sailed for Holland.
During his residence in Holland, Calderwood published his Altare Damascenum (1623) attacking episcopacy. He appears to have returned to Scotland in 1625 and was later appointed minister of Pencaitland, East Lothian. He spent his last years writing his History of the Kirk of Scotland, the only published edition of which was made in digest form by the Wodrow society (1842–49).
