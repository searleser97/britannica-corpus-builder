Yosef Burg, also spelled Josef Burg,  (born January 31, 1909, Dresden, Germany—died October 15, 1999, Jerusalem), German-born Jewish rabbi and Israeli politician who was the longest-serving member of the Israeli Knesset (parliament), holding his seat from the Knesset’s first session in 1949 until his retirement in 1986.
Burg studied at the University of Berlin and in 1933 earned a doctorate in philosophy from the University of Leipzig. Ordained a rabbi at age 24, he was involved in the Zionist youth movement and in 1939 emigrated to Palestine. There he taught at a high school in Tel Aviv, and after World War II he went to France, where he became director of an organization that aided Holocaust survivors. He returned to Israel in 1949 and that year was elected to the newly established Knesset. In 1956 Burg became a founding member of the moderate National Religious Party (Mafdal); over time, the party became increasingly right-wing, and Burg drew criticism for not asserting a more moderate influence. A cabinet minister under eight Israeli prime ministers, he was known for his attempts to heal rifts between religious and secular Jews in Israel. His son, Avraham, also was a prominent politician.
