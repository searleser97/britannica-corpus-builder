Louis I de Lorraine, cardinal de Guise,  (born Oct. 21, 1527—died May 29, 1578), brother of François, 2nd duc de Guise.
Named bishop of Troyes (1545) and of Albi (1550), he became in 1553 “cardinal de Guise”—to distinguish him from his brother, the eminent Charles, cardinal de Lorraine (q.v.). Unlike his brothers, he preferred the easy life of good food and drink to the life of war and political intrigue and thus gained the name of the cardinal of the bottle (le cardinal des bouteilles).
