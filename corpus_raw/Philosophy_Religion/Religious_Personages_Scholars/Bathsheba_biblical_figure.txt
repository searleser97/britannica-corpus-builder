Bathsheba, also spelled Bethsabee,  in the Hebrew Bible (2 Samuel 11, 12; 1 Kings 1, 2), wife of Uriah the Hittite; she later became one of the wives of King David and the mother of King Solomon.
Bathsheba was a daughter of Eliam and was probably of noble birth. A beautiful woman, she became pregnant after David saw her bathing on a rooftop and had her brought to him. David then ordered that Uriah be moved to the front-line of a battle, where he was killed. David married the widowed Bathsheba, but their first child died as punishment from God for David’s adultery and murder of Uriah. David repented of his sins, and Bathsheba later gave birth to Solomon. When David was dying, Bathsheba successfully conspired with the prophet Nathan to block Adonijah’s succession to the throne and to win it for Solomon. She occupied an influential position as the queen mother.
