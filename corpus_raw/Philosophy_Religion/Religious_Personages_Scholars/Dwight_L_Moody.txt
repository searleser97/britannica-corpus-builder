Dwight L. Moody, in full Dwight Lyman Moody,  (born February 5, 1837, East Northfield, Massachusetts, U.S.—died December 22, 1899, Northfield, Massachusetts), prominent American evangelist who set the pattern for later evangelism in large cities.
Moody left his mother’s farm at age 17 to work in Boston and there was converted from Unitarianism to evangelicalism. In 1856 he moved to Chicago and prospered as a shoe salesman but in 1860 gave up business for missionary work. He worked with the Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA; 1861–73), was president of the Chicago YMCA, founded the Moody Church, and engaged in slum mission work.
In 1870 he met Ira D. Sankey, a hymn writer, and with him became noted for contributing to the growth of the “gospel hymn.” They made extended evangelical tours in Great Britain (1873–75, 1881–84). Moody shunned divisive sectarian doctrines, deplored “higher criticism” of the Bible, the Social Gospel movement, and the theory of evolution. Instead he colourfully and intensely preached “the old-fashioned gospel,” emphasizing a literal interpretation of the Bible and looking toward the premillennial Second Coming.
Moody’s mass revivals were financed by prominent businessmen who believed he would alleviate the hardships of the poor. Moody himself ardently supported various charities but felt that social problems could be solved only by the divine regeneration of individuals. As well as conducting revivals, he directed annual Bible conferences at Northfield, Massachusetts, where he founded a seminary for girls in 1879. In 1889 he founded the Chicago Bible Institute (now the Moody Bible Institute).
