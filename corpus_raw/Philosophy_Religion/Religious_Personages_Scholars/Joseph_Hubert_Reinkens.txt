Joseph Hubert Reinkens,  (born Jan. 3, 1821, Burtscheid, Prussia [now Aachen, Ger.]—died  April 1, 1896, Bonn, Ger.), German bishop, historical scholar, and a leader of the Old Catholics (Altkatholiken), a dissident group that separated from the Roman Catholic church because of opposition to the doctrine of papal infallibility pronounced by the First Vatican Council (1869–70). After his excommunication by Rome, Reinkens joined in the promulgation of the Nuremberg Declaration (1871), the constitution of the Old Catholic church in Germany, and was elected its first bishop.
