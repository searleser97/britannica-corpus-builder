Thomas Charles,  (born Oct. 14, 1755, Pantdwin, near St. Clears, Carmarthenshire, Wales—died  Oct. 5, 1814, Bala, Merionethshire), Welsh religious leader, a founder of Calvinistic Methodism in Wales and an inspirer of missionary activities.
Educated at the dissenting academy in Carmarthen and at Jesus College, Oxford, after holding curacies in Somerset, he settled in 1783 in the neighbourhood of Bala, his wife’s home. He failed to find a living in the established Anglican church, but his wife’s shop provided some economic security. In 1784 he joined the Methodist society at Bala and became, in effect, a free-lance minister.
From his student days he had been under the influence of the Methodist revival, and he was deeply committed to evangelism and education. Training teachers himself, he set up numbers of schools, which at first circulated but soon settled into Sunday schools. He compiled a dictionary of the Bible and edited a quarterly magazine, both in Welsh; he composed a catechism in Welsh and English and set up a printing press at Bala. He helped to found both the British and Foreign Bible Society (1804), which printed a Welsh Bible in 1806, and the London Missionary Society. In Wales, Methodism was still nominally within the Church of England, but few clergy besides Charles were sympathetic. The rapid growth of Methodist societies and associations as a result of his labours led, insensibly yet inevitably, to the demand for a separate organization with its own ministers. Charles, who like Wesley never repudiated his own episcopal orders, long opposed this, but in 1811 he drew up a form of ordination and himself ordained eight lay preachers.
