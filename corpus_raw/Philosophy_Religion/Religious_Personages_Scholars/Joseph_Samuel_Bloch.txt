Joseph Samuel Bloch,  (born Nov. 20, 1850, Dukla, Galicia, Austrian Empire [now in Poland]—died  Oct. 1, 1923, Vienna [Austria]), Austrian rabbi, politician, journalist, and crusader against anti-Semitism, particularly the so-called blood accusation, or blood libel—the allegation that Jews use the blood of Christians in the Passover ritual.
After serving as a rabbi in several small communities, Bloch settled in Florisdorf, a suburb of Vienna. At the time, anti-Semitism was gaining momentum in Austria. It culminated in the notorious trial, in 1882, of 15 Jews living in Tiszaeszlár who were accused of murdering a 14-year-old girl named Esther Solymosi to use her blood for the coming Passover ceremonies. When August Rohling, of the Roman Catholic theological faculty at the University of Prague, claimed that he could prove under oath the actuality of the blood ritual, Bloch retaliated. In a series of articles, he accused Rohling of ignorance and deceit, and Rohling sued for libel. He withdrew his suit, however. Nevertheless, Bloch published a compendium of the expert evidence he had prepared for the trial in his work Israel und die Voelker (1922; Israel and the Nations).
He left the rabbinate and from 1884 to 1921 published Österreichische Wochenschrift (“Austrian Weekly”), financed by a Christian, Baron Scher, in which anti-Semitism was uncompromisingly attacked. Bloch carried on the fight in the Austrian parliament, of which he was a member three times during the years 1883–85 and 1891–95. In 1893 he instituted criminal proceedings against three men who had accused a group of rabbis of the blood ritual. The men were found guilty of conspiracy and imprisoned.
