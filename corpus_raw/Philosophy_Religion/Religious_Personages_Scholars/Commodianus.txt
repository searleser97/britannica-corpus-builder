Commodianus,  (flourished between 3rd and 5th centuries ad), Christian Latin poet, perhaps of African origin. His Carmen apologeticum (“Song with Narrative”) expounds Christian doctrine, dealing with the Creation, God’s revelation of himself to man, Antichrist, and the end of the world. All but two of his Instructiones—80 poems in two books—are in acrostic form, undoubtedly because the technique was a useful mnemonic device. In the work he attacked pagan deities, criticized the Jews, and admonished Christians. His verse has no poetic value and is of interest chiefly for its employment of vulgar Latin idiom at a period when the Romance languages were emerging from Latin.
