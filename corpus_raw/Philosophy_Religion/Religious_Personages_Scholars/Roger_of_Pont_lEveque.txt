Roger of Pont l’Évêque,  (died Nov. 26, 1181, York, Yorkshire, Eng.), archbishop of York and adviser of King Henry II of England, who supported the King in his dispute with Thomas Becket, archbishop of Canterbury.
With Becket, he was, as a young man, member of the household of Theobald, archbishop of Canterbury. He was archdeacon of Canterbury (1148) and chaplain to King Stephen before being consecrated archbishop of York (October 1154). Having been appointed papal legate in England, Roger visited Pope Alexander III and King Louis VII the Young of France on behalf of Henry. In 1170, despite the exiled Becket’s protests, and a prohibition from the Pope, Roger carried out Henry’s wishes and crowned the King’s eldest son, Henry (the “Young King”), at Westminster. Becket, with papal authority, suspended Roger and others who took part in the coronation and was subsequently murdered. Roger was accused of urging Becket’s assassination but was absolved of all blame and returned to his see. He continued to dispute the provincial primacy of Canterbury over York until, in 1176, Henry II arranged a truce between Roger and Richard, archbishop of Canterbury.
