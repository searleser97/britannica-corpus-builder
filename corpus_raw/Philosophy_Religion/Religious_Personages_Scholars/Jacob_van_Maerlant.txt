Jacob van Maerlant,  (born 1225, Vrije van Brugge [Damme?]—died  1291, Damme), pioneer of the didactic poetry that flourished in the Netherlands in the 14th century.
The details of Maerlant’s life are disputed, but he was probably sexton at Maerlant, near Brielle on Voorne, in 1255–65?, and was employed by Albrecht van Voorne; Nicholas Cats, lord of North Beveland; and Floris V, count of Holland. About 1266 he became clerk to the court at Damme. He had an intimate knowledge of both Latin and French. His early works were versions of medieval romances—Alexanders Geesten, based on Gautier de Châtillon’s Latin Alexandreis; the Historie van den Grale Merlyn (c. 1260), freely translated from Robert de Borron’s early contributions to the Arthurian cycle; Torec (c. 1262); and, most important, the Historie van Troyen (c. 1264), from the Roman de Troie ascribed to Benoît de Sainte Maure.
When Maerlant began to write with the aim of providing instruction, he turned entirely to Latin sources, writing a scientific compilation, Der Naturen Bloeme (1266–69?), after Thomas of Cantimpré’s De natura rerum; a life of St. Francis (before 1273), based on Bonaventura; the Rijmbijbel (1271), after Petrus Comestor’s Historia Scolastica; and, finally, his most important work, Spieghel Historiael, an adaptation with additions of his own of Vincent de Beauvais’s Speculum Historiale, begun about 1282 and completed after his death by Philippe Utenbroeke and Lodewijk van Velthem. These moralizing rhymed encyclopaedic works were written to satisfy the rising class of commoners who wished for instructive reading in their own language.
His own considerable gifts as a religious poet are also fully shown in Wapene Martijn, a dialogue poem on the decadence of the period and moral problems, and in his fervent Disputacie van Onser Vrouwen ende vanden Heilighen Cruce and Van den Lande van Oversee, which scourges the laxity of the church and calls for a new crusade.
