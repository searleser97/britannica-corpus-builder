Ceolnoth,   (died 870, Canterbury, Kent, Eng.), 17th archbishop of Canterbury, who played a conciliatory role during the invasions of England by the Danish Vikings.
Ceolnoth’s early life is obscure. He was elected and consecrated archbishop probably in 833. At the council of Kingston, Surrey, now Kingston upon Thames, London, in 838, he made a firm alliance with the West Saxon kings Egbert and his son Aethelwulf, who gave Ceolnoth land in return. Many of Ceolnoth’s coins have been found; they may represent his church’s treasure converted into money to buy peace from the Danes, who invaded Kent in 851 and 865.
