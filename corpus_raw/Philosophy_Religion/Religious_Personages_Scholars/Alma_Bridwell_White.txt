Alma Bridwell White, née Mollie Alma Bridwell,  (born June 16, 1862, Kinniconick, Lewis county, Ky., U.S.—died June 26, 1946, Zarephath, N.J.),  American religious leader who was a founder and major moving force in the evangelical Methodist Pentecostal Union Church, which split from mainstream Methodism in the early 20th century.
Alma Bridwell grew up in a dour family of little means. She studied at the Millersburg (Kentucky) Female College and in 1882 moved to Bannack, Montana Territory, where she taught school for a time. In 1887 she married Kent White, a Methodist seminarian. In a succession of small, out-of-the-way pastorates in Colorado, she led hymns and prayers and occasionally preached. Her tall, homely appearance and commanding voice proved of great effect, and she soon discovered the ability to move congregations to tears or to shouts of joy.
An intense experience of personal sanctification in March 1893 induced White to organize a series of revival meetings at which she attempted to recover the fervour and piety of primitive Methodism. Her zealous emotionalism, together with her outspoken criticisms of the decorous accommodations of the Methodist hierarchy, brought the wrath of conservative churchmen down on White and her husband, who was transferred to a still-less-desirable pastorate. She eventually persuaded him to resign altogether.
For a time the couple traveled and evangelized together in Colorado, Montana, and Wyoming, and in December 1901 White founded the Methodist Pentecostal Union Church in Denver, Colorado. She was ordained an elder of the new sect in March 1902, the same year she published Looking Back from Beulah, about the course of her life leading to the founding of her church. A short time later she founded the Pentecostal Union Herald, which in 1904 was renamed the Pillar of Fire. In 1907 the headquarters of the church was moved to Zarephath, New Jersey, where a tract of land had been donated by a follower, and the sect grew rapidly. From 1904 to 1905 White made the first of 29 evangelizing missions to Great Britain. Evangelists and missionaries of the sect adopted military uniforms similar to those of the Salvation Army. In 1917 the church changed its name to the Pillar of Fire, reflecting White’s firm opposition to the rise of more primitive and undisciplined forms of Pentecostalism. In 1918 she was consecrated senior bishop of the Pillar of Fire, becoming the first woman bishop of any Christian church.
In addition to running a constant round of revivals, the church came to operate two radio stations (in Denver and in New Jersey), establish seven schools, including Alma White College (founded 1921) in Zarephath, and carry on a large religious publishing program.
Among White’s own books were Demons and Tongues (1910), The New Testament Church (1911–12; two volumes), Restoration of Israel, the Hope of the World (1917), The Story of My Life (1919–30; five volumes), The Ku Klux Klan in Prophecy (1925), in which she outlined biblical sanctions for the Klan, Hymns and Poems (1931), and The Sword of the Spirit (1937). By 1936 the Pillar of Fire church owned property worth an estimated $4 million and had over 4,000 members in 46 congregations. On her death in 1946—her husband having left the church in 1909—she was succeeded as senior bishop by her son, Ray Bridwell White, who died five months later.
