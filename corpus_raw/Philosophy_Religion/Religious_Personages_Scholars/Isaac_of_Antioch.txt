Isaac of Antioch, also called Isaac the Great,  (died c. 460), Syrian writer, probably a priest of an independent Syrian Christian church and author of a wealth of theological literature and historical verse describing events in Rome and Asia Minor.
According to 5th-century Byzantine chroniclers, Isaac was a native of Amida, near modern Erzurum, Turkey. At Rome he composed verse on the civic festivals of 404 and the capture of Rome by the Visigoths under Alaric in 410. During later travels, he was imprisoned briefly by the Byzantines in Constantinople for unknown reasons.
Isaac then settled with the Christian community at Antioch, modern Antakya, Turkey, and probably received holy orders from a Jacobite bishop, the head of the miaphysite Christians, a Syrian church that emphasized that Christ had one nature (see Syriac Orthodox Church).
Isaac is credited with a lengthy poetic account of Antioch’s destruction by earthquake in 459. He is also the reputed author of two collections of works containing, respectively, 60 and 40 mēmrē, or poetic discourses. These writings and a series of commentaries on theological and ascetical subjects are now generally held by contemporary scholars to be the work of perhaps three writers with the same name residing in or about Antioch but of differing theological views. The works have been edited by G. Bickell, Sancti Isaaci Antiocheni, doctoris Syrorum, opera omnia, 2 vol. (1873–77; “Complete Works of Holy Isaac of Antioch, Doctor of the Syrians”), and, by P. Bedjan, Sancti Isaaci Syri Antiocheni homiliae syriacae (1903; “Syriac Homilies of the Holy Syrian Isaac of Antioch”).
