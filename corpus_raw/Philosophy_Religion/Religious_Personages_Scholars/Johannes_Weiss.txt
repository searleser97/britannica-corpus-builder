Johannes Weiss,  (born Dec. 13, 1863, Kiel, Schleswig-Holstein [now in Germany]—died Aug. 24, 1914, Heidelberg, Ger.), German theologian known for his work in New Testament criticism. He wrote the first eschatological interpretations of the Gospel (1892) and also set forth the principles of “form-criticism” (1912)—the analysis of biblical passages through the examination of their structural form.
Weiss was educated at the universities of Marburg, Berlin, Göttingen, and Breslau and later taught at Göttingen, Marburg, and Heidelberg. In 1892 his Die Predigt Jesu vom Reiche Gottes (“Jesus’ Proclamation of the Kingdom of God”) argued the eschatological view that Jesus Christ’s teachings reflected contemporary hopes for the appearance of an imminent Kingdom of God. Weiss also wrote such popular works as Paulus und Jesus (1909), Jesus von Nazareth, Mythus oder Geschichte? (1910; Jesus of Nazareth, Myth or History?), and Das Urchristentum, completed by R. Knopf (1917; The History of Primitive Christianity).
