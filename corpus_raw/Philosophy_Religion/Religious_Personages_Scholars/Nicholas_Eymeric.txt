Nicholas Eymeric,  Eymeric also spelled Eymerich, or Eimeric,  Spanish Nicolás Eimerico,  (born c. 1320, Gerona, Aragon [Spain]—died  Jan. 4, 1399, Gerona), Roman Catholic theologian, grand inquisitor at Aragon, and supporter of the Avignon papacy.
After joining the Dominican Order in 1334, Eymeric wrote on theology and philosophy. Appointed grand inquisitor about 1357, he performed his duties zealously and made so many enemies that he was removed from office in 1360. He continued to teach and write and was again appointed inquisitor in 1366. He opposed the writings of Ramon Llull, the philosopher, and influenced Pope Gregory XI to condemn several of Llull’s works. When King John I of Aragon ascended the throne in 1387, he was influenced to defend Llull’s works and to banish Eymeric. The inquisitor retained his position but retired to the Avignon papal court. Directorium inquisitorium, his only extensive work, was compiled in 1376 as a guide for inquisitors and was later printed (1503) and reissued many times. He returned to the Gerona monastery in 1397.
