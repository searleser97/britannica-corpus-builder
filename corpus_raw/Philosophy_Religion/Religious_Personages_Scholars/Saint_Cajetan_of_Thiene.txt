St. Cajetan of Thiene, Italian San Gaetano da Thiene, Thiene also spelled Tiene,  (born October 1480, Vicenza, Republic of Venice—died August 7, 1547, Naples; canonized 1671; feast day August 7), Venetian priest who cofounded the Theatine order and became an important figure of the Catholic Counter-Reformation. He is the patron saint of Argentina and of gamblers and the unemployed.
Receiving his doctorate in civil and canon law at Padua (1504), he was appointed a prothonotary (clerk) in the Roman Curia by Pope Julius II in 1506. Associated with the local Oratory of Divine Love in Rome, Cajetan was ordained in 1516 and continued the charitable works characteristic of the association. He revitalized oratories at Vicenza (1518) and at Verona (1519); at Venice (1522) he founded a hospital for the incurably ill and a local branch of the oratory.
Returning to Rome in 1523, he met Archbishop Gian Pietro Carafa, the future Pope Paul IV. In 1524 they established the Congregation of Clerics Regular (Theatines) to further the ideals of the Oratory of Divine Love among diocesan priests and to promote clerical reform through asceticism and apostolic work. After Emperor Charles V sacked Rome, Carafa and Cajetan escaped to Venice in 1527. Following his dispatch as Theatine superior to Naples (1533), Cajetan created a centre of Catholic reform at the church of San Paolo Maggiore in May 1538. He also founded a charitable nonprofit bank to help protect the poor from usury; it later became the Banco di Napoli (Bank of Naples). Except for 1540–43, when he was at Venice, he remained at Naples until his death.
He was beatified by Pope Urban VIII in 1629 and was canonized by Pope Clement X in 1671. In art he is often depicted holding the child Jesus, which represents a vision he had of Mary handing him her child on Christmas Day.
