Calixtus (III), also spelled Callistus, original name Giovanni di Struma, English John of Struma,  (flourished 12th century), antipope from 1168 to 1178, who reigned with the support of the Holy Roman emperor Frederick I Barbarossa.
Calixtus was elected as Antipope Paschal III’s successor, in opposition to Pope Alexander III. He was Frederick’s protégé until the Treaty of Anagni (1176), which ended the schism in Alexander’s favour with the proviso that Calixtus should have an abbacy to compensate for his deposition. Calixtus ignored the treaty and remained obstinate even after the conclusion of the Peace of Venice (1177) between Frederick and the Lombards. In August 1178, however, he submitted to Alexander, who treated him generously, making him governor of papal Benevento.
