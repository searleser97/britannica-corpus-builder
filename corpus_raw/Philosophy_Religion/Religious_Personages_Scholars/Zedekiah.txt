Zedekiah, original name Mattaniah,  (flourished  6th century bc), king of Judah (597–587/586 bc) whose reign ended in the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem and the deportation of most of the Jews to Babylon.
Mattaniah was the son of Josiah and the uncle of Jehoiachin, the reigning king of Judah. In 597 bc the Babylonians under King Nebuchadrezzar besieged and captured Jerusalem. They deported Jehoiachin to Babylon and made Mattaniah regent under the name Zedekiah. Zedekiah thus held his throne as a vassal under an oath of allegiance to Nebuchadrezzar, but under local pressure he began to intrigue against the latter in concert with the neighbouring states of Moab, Edom, Ammon, Tyre, and Sidon.
In the ninth year of Zedekiah’s rule a Babylonian army laid siege to Jerusalem after he had conspired to revolt against the Babylonians with Egypt’s help. During the siege the prophet Jeremiah (q.v.) urged patient submission to the dominion of the Babylonians, which he regarded as the will of God, but royal officials and Jewish notables denounced him and he was accused of desertion and imprisoned.
In the sixth month of the siege a breach was made in the city walls. Zedekiah and his men fled by night toward the Jordan River, but they were soon captured. He and his leaders were taken before King Nebuchadrezzar at Riblah, in Syria, where Zedekiah’s sons were slain in his presence and he, a disloyal vassal, was blinded and carried in chains to Babylon, where he was imprisoned until his death. The walls and houses of Jerusalem were destroyed, its temple was sacked and burned, and the people of Judah, except for the poorest of the land, were deported to Babylon. Thus began the Babylonian Exile. Judah lost its status as a kingdom and became a Babylonian province.
The story of Zedekiah is told in the Old Testament in the Second Book of Kings, chapters 24 and 25, in the Second Book of Chronicles, chapter 36, and in various passages in the Book of Jeremiah.
