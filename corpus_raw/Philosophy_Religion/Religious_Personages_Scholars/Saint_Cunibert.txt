Saint Cunibert,  (born c. 590, Moselle, Austrasia [now in France]—died c. 663, Cologne [Germany]; feast day November 12), prelate, bishop of Cologne and chief minister of King Sigebert III of Austrasia.
Educated at the court of the Frankish king Clotaire II and at Trier, where he became archdeacon, Cunibert was made bishop of Cologne in 623. He took part in the Synods of Clichy (626–27) and Reims (627–30), later serving as counselor to the Carolingian mayor of the palace of Austrasia Pippin I the Elder and King Dagobert I, whose son, Sigebert, he tutored. Cunibert exercised great political influence at the Merovingian court, especially under Sigebert. He encouraged missions to the Frisians and avidly founded numerous monasteries and churches.
