Arnobius The Elder,  (flourished  4th century, Africa), early Christian convert who defended Christianity by demonstrating to the pagans their own inconsistencies.
Arnobius was born a pagan but had become a Christian by ad 300. He taught rhetoric at Sicca Veneria in Africa during the reign (284–305) of the Roman emperor Diocletian. Because of his former paganism, Arnobius was suspected, notably by the local bishop, and as a pledge of his conviction he composed the seven books Adversus nationes (c. 303; “Against the Pagans”). Nothing further is known about his life.
A general defense of Christianity from pagan calumnies (books 1 and 2) is followed by attacks on Neoplatonism, anthropomorphism, and heathen mythology (books 3–5), concluding with worship of images, temples, and ceremonials (books 6 and 7).
