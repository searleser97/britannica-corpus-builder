Robert Lowth, also spelled Robert Louth,  (born Nov. 27, 1710, Winchester, Hampshire—died  Nov. 3, 1787, London), Church of England bishop of London (appointed 1777) and literary scholar. During his Oxford professorship (1741–50) he was noted for his analyses and commentaries on Hebrew poetry, later published as De sacra poesi Hebraeorum (1753; Eng. trans., Lectures on Hebrew Poetry, 1787). As bishop, he eradicated abuses of the clergy in political and financial matters and declined (1783) to be named archbishop of Canterbury. His writings include Life of William of Wykeham (1758); A Short Introduction to English Grammar (1762); and Sermons and Other Remains (1834).
