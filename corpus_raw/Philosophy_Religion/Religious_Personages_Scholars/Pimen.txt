Pimen, original name Sergey Mikhailovich Isvekov,  (born July 23, 1910, Bogdorodsk, near Moscow, Russia—died  May 3, 1990, Moscow), 14th Russian Orthodox patriarch of Moscow and of all Russia. He served as spiritual leader of his church during the final years of official Soviet repression and the subsequent period of religious renewal following the dissolution of the U.S.S.R.
Pimen was tonsured a monk in 1927 and ordained a priest in 1932. The next 14 years of his life are omitted from his official biography; he was widely believed to have been arrested twice, to have spent approximately 10 years in prison, and to have served in the army. In 1946 Pimen evidently returned to monastic life and subsequently served as abbot of the Pskov Cave monastery and later the Zagorsk monastery. He left the cloister in 1957 and rose rapidly through ecclesiastical offices as bishop of Balta, archbishop of Moscow, metropolitan of Leningrad, and metropolitan of Krutitsky and Kolomna.
In 1971 Pimen was elected unopposed as patriarch. Although he was revered as a pious and sincere man, he had little or no theological education and consistently followed the policy of obedience and accommodation to the communist government. He served 18 years as patriarch; in 1989 he was elected to represent the Russian Orthodox church in the new Congress of People’s Deputies.
