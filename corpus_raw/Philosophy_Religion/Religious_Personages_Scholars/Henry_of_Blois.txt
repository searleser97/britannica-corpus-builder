Henry Of Blois,   (born c. 1099—died  Aug. 8, 1171, Winchester, Hampshire, Eng.), bishop of Winchester (from 1129) and papal legate in England (1139–43), who was largely instrumental in having his brother Stephen recognized as king of England (1135).
Henry was the fourth son of Stephen, count of Blois and Chartres, and of Adela, daughter of William I the Conqueror. As a younger son of a royal family, he received high ecclesiastical office: he was abbot of Glastonbury (from 1126) and bishop of Winchester, the richest see in England. The hostility of St. Bernard of Clairvaux denied Henry the archbishopric of Canterbury (1136), but as papal legate he had powers superior to those of the archbishop, Theobald. During the civil war for the English crown between his brother Stephen and his cousin Matilda, Henry transferred his allegiance to Matilda (1141) but soon quarreled with her and returned to Stephen. After his retirement from English politics (1154), he went to France, where he reorganized the finances of the abbey of Cluny. Henry was a capable soldier and a patron of the arts as well as a churchman.
