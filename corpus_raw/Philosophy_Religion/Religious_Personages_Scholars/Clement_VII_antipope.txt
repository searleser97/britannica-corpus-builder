Clement (VII), original name Robert of Geneva, French Robert de Genève,  (born 1342, Geneva [Switzerland]—died Sept. 16, 1394, Avignon, Provence [France]), first antipope (1378–94) of the Western (Great) Schism that troubled the Roman Catholic church for 40 years.
After serving as bishop of Thérouanne, county of Artois, from 1361, he became archbishop of Cambrai, in the Low Countries, in 1368 and cardinal in 1371. As papal legate to northern Italy (1376–78), he pillaged Cesena in 1377, where 4,000 antipapal rebels were massacred in the war against Florence.
He was a leader of the cardinals who declared the unpopular Italian pope Urban VI’s election invalid, and he was chosen antipope at Fondi, Papal States, as Clement VII on Sept. 20, 1378. His coronation in October precipitated the Great Schism of the West (1378–1417). By the end of that year, France favoured Clement over Urban, whom England supported. European countries then split over the papal claimants, and the Eastern church generally sided with Clement. He hoped to dislodge Urban from the Vatican with help from French mercenaries who were occupying the castle of Sant’Angelo, Rome. After Sant’Angelo fell in April 1379, Clement retired to Naples, where Queen Joan I recognized him as pope. But the Neapolitans favoured Urban, and Clement soon settled at Avignon.
The church’s dual papacy caused profound confusion in territories that were uncertain which pope to obey; the difference on this issue between England and France prolonged the Hundred Years’ War (1337–1453). France was especially given the chance to intervene in Italian politics. King Charles V the Wise of France not only recognized Clement but on the day of Clement’s death declared him “the true Shepherd of the Church.” Clement himself died convinced of his legitimacy.
