Saint Urban I,  (born, Rome?—died  230, Rome [Italy]; feast day May 25), pope from 222 to 230. Succeeding that of St. Calixtus I, his pontificate occurred within the reign of the Roman emperor Severus Alexander, a time of peace for the church. His baptism of St. Cecilia’s husband, St. Valerian, is fictitious. He was buried in the cemetery of St. Calixtus, Rome.
