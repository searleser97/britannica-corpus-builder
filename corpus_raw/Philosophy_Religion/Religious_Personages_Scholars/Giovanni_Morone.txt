Giovanni Morone,  (born Jan. 25, 1509, Milan [Italy]—died Dec. 1, 1580, Rome), Italian cardinal, one of the greatest diplomats of the Protestant Reformation, and the last president of the Council of Trent—the 19th ecumenical council of the Roman Catholic church—which convened between 1545 and 1563 at Trento to restore church morale and doctrines challenged by the Reformation.
Morone was named bishop of Modena in 1529. In 1536 Pope Paul III sent him as ambassador to Germany, where he encouraged theological discussions while working toward a general council that would bring peace to Christian countries and would appease Catholics and Protestants. He assisted at the German diets of Hagenau (1540), Ratisbon (now Regensburg; 1541), and Speyer (1542), where he succeeded in getting Trento accepted as the locality of the council which Paul III convoked for Nov. 1, 1542.
He returned to Rome in 1542 and was made cardinal. He was appointed as Paul’s emissary to the Council of Trent, but when the council was postponed (until 1545), Paul made Morone governor of Bologna in 1544. Under Pope Julius III, Morone became bishop of Novara (1553–60). In 1557 Pope Paul IV imprisoned him at Rome on suspicion of heresy, but he was released on Paul’s death (1559) and was absolved by Pius IV, who in 1563 appointed Morone president of the Council of Trent.
Morone’s diplomacy saved the council from disaster when a large international body of bishops pressed for a statement that episcopal jurisdiction came to each bishop directly from God and not through the pope. Opposition by the Roman delegation resulted in a deadlock. Morone secured the surrender of the extremists on both sides, and the council finally accepted the statement that bishops were assigned by the Holy Ghost to rule the church. Thus he brought the council’s last period to a successful conclusion.
Morone was made bishop of Ostia in 1570 and spent his last years administering the English College in Rome in his capacity as cardinal protector of England.
