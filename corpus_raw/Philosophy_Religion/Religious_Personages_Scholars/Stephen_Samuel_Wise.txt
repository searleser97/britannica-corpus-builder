Stephen Samuel Wise,  (born March 17, 1874, Budapest, Hung., Austria-Hungary—died  April 19, 1949, New York, N.Y., U.S.), Reform rabbi, a leader of the Zionist movement in the United States, and a liberal activist who influenced the development of Reform Judaism in that country.
Wise earned his Ph.D. at Columbia University in 1901 and received his rabbinical training from private teachers. After serving as rabbi to congregations in New York City (1893–1900) and Portland, Ore. (1900–06), he was invited to become rabbi of Temple Emanu-El (New York City), then the most influential Reform congregation in the country. He declined the appointment, however, after receiving inadequate assurances of free speech in the pulpit, and he founded the influential Free Synagogue (1907) instead, which he led until his death. Wise became a noted civic reformer in New York City politics in subsequent decades and was famous for his brilliant and timely sermons, which he preached to large audiences at Carnegie Hall for many years.
Wise was one of the first Jewish leaders in the United States to become active in the Zionist movement. He attended the Second Zionist Congress in Basel, Switz., in 1898, and that same year he helped found the Zionist Organization of America (ZOA), of which he served as president in 1936–38. He also helped found and led the permanent American Jewish Congress and the World Jewish Congress (1936). As a prominent member of the Democratic Party and an acquaintance of President Woodrow Wilson, Wise influenced the U.S. government toward approval of the Balfour Declaration. He was a leader in the struggle to marshal American public opinion against Adolf Hitler in the 1930s.
In 1922 Wise founded the Jewish Institute of Religion in New York City, a seminary that was especially designed to train liberal rabbis for the New York area; this school merged with Hebrew Union College in 1950.
