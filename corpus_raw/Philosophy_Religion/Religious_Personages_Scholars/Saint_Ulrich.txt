Saint Ulrich, Ulrich also spelled Ulric,  (born c. 890, Augsburg, Alemannia—died  July 4, 973, Augsburg; canonized 993; feast day July 4), bishop and patron saint of Augsburg, the first person known to have been canonized by a pope.
Of noble birth, he studied at the monastic school of Sankt Gallen (St. Gall), Switz., and was then trained by his uncle Bishop Adalbero of Augsburg. He returned to Zürich in 910, remaining there until 924, when he was appointed bishop of Augsburg by the German king Henry I the Fowler.
A supporter of the Holy Roman emperor Otto I the Great, he acted as mediator in the imperial struggle with Otto’s son Liudolf of Swabia, who had rebelled against his father but submitted in 955. By fortifying Augsburg, Ulrich also enabled that city to withstand a siege by the Magyars (Hungarians) until Otto arrived to defeat them at the Battle of Lechfeld (Aug. 10, 955), near Augsburg. Otto then granted Ulrich the unprecedented right to coin money. He was canonized by Pope John XV in 993.
