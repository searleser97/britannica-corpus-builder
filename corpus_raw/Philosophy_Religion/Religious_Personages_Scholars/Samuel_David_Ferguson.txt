Samuel David Ferguson,  (born January 1, 1842, Charleston, South Carolina, U.S.—died August 2, 1900, Cape Palmas, Liberia), first African American bishop of the Episcopal Church.
As a young boy, Ferguson moved with his family in 1848 to Liberia. There he was educated in the mission schools of the Anglican Communion and later received theological training from missionaries in other areas of West Africa. He was ordained a deacon of the Episcopal Church on March 28, 1865, and a priest on March 15, 1868. He served as rector of St. Mark’s church in Harper, Liberia, until 1885, and both before and after his ordination he was a teacher and headmaster at a local boys’ school. He was appointed missionary bishop of Cape Palmas and West Africa in 1885, traveling to New York City for his consecration on June 24, 1885; he thereby became the first African American member of the Episcopal Church’s House of Bishops. Ferguson was also founder of Cuttington College (now Cuttington University College) in Liberia, the oldest institution of higher learning in sub-Saharan Africa.
