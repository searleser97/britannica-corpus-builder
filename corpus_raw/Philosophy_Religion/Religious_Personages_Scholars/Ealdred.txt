Ealdred, also spelled Aldred,  (died Sept. 11, 1069, York, Eng.), Anglo-Saxon archbishop of York from 1061, played an important part in secular politics at the time of the Norman conquest and legitimized the rule of William the Conqueror (William I) by crowning him king on Christmas Day, 1066.
Ealdred, originally a monk at Winchester, became abbot of Tavistock, Devon, about 1027 and bishop of Worcester in 1046. Made archbishop of York by Pope Nicholas II, he was forced by Nicholasâ€™ successor, Alexander II, to relinquish the see of Worcester in 1062. As archbishop he did considerable ecclesiastical building in the city of York and elsewhere.
In 1054 Ealdred went to Germany to negotiate with the emperor Henry III for the return from Hungary of the heir to the English throne, Edward, son of Edmund Ironside. In 1058 he became the first English bishop to make the pilgrimage to Jerusalem. He probably crowned Harold II as king of the English (Jan. 6, 1066). After the Battle of Hastings (Oct. 14, 1066), Ealdred was among those who wished to elect Edgar the Aetheling as successor to the slain Harold, but he soon joined Edgar in declaring allegiance to William I. With the approval of the papacy, Ealdred crowned the new king in Westminster Abbey.
