John Wood Oman,  (born July 23, 1860, Orkney, Scot.—died  May 17, 1939, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, Eng.), British Presbyterian theologian.
After graduating from Edinburgh University and the theological college of the United Presbyterian Church, Oman studied in Germany. After serving as an assistant pastor in Paisley, Scot., he transferred to the ministry of the Presbyterian Church of England. In 1907 he was appointed professor of systematic theology at its theological college in Cambridge (Westminster College), of which he was later principal (1922–35). Oman taught the uniqueness and independence of the religious consciousness: the sense of “the sacred” establishes man as a personal being in the midst of natural process. In his main work, The Natural and the Supernatural (1931), Oman developed this view in a wide-ranging treatment of knowledge and perception, of necessity and freedom, and of the history and classification of religions. His other works include Grace and Personality (1917), Vision and Authority (1902), and The Church and the Divine Order (1911).
