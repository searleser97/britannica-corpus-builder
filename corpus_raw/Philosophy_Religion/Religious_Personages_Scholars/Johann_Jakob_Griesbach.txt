Johann Jakob Griesbach,  (born Jan. 4, 1745, Butzbach, Hesse [Germany]—died  March 24, 1812, Jena, Thuringia), rationalist Protestant German theologian, the earliest biblical critic to subject the Gospels to systematic literary analysis.
Griesbach studied at Halle (then belonging to Prussia) under J.S. Semler, and from 1775 until his death he was professor of New Testament studies at the University of Jena. He originated the term synoptic to designate the first three Gospels and, rejecting the traditional view, held that Mark was derived from Matthew and Luke (the “usage hypothesis”). Griesbach also published a corrected Greek edition of the New Testament.
