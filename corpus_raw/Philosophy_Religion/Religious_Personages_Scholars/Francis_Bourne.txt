Francis Bourne,  (born March 23, 1861, Clapham, London, Eng.—died  Jan. 1, 1935, Westminster), cardinal, archbishop of Westminster who was a strong leader of Roman Catholics, pursuing, despite adverse criticism, policies he considered right for church and state.
Educated at St. Sulpice, Paris, and the Catholic University of Leuven (Louvain), Bourne was ordained in 1884 and was appointed (1889) rector of St. John’s Seminary, Wonersh, Surrey. In 1895 he became a monsignor and in 1896 coadjutor bishop of Southwark. He was made archbishop of Westminster in 1903 and became prominent when, in 1908, the Blessed Sacrament procession he had planned through the streets during the Eucharistic Congress was banned for fear of disturbances; he opposed the ban by having the benediction given from the loggia of the cathedral.
After becoming cardinal in 1911, his influence grew. He championed the rights of the Arabs in Palestine, upheld Roman Catholic claims in education, condemned violence in Ireland, denounced the general strike, reproved the modernists, and was lukewarm toward the Malines conversations on interfaith problems inaugurated by Cardinal Mercier, Lord Halifax, and other Anglicans. He took a strong interest in university education, preferring that Roman Catholics attend the national universities rather than attempt to set up schools of their own and that they join existing political parties rather than form a Roman Catholic party. E.J. Oldmeadow’s two-volume Francis, Cardinal Bourne appeared in 1940 and 1944.
