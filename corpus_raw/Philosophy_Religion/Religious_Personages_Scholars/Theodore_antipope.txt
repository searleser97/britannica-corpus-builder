Theodore,  (flourished 7th century, Italy), antipope from September 21 to December 15, 687.
A Roman archpriest, Theodore had already been a papal candidate when Pope John V (685–686) died. Following the death of John’s successor, Pope Conon (686–687), a simultaneous double election conducted by opposing factions attempted to enthrone Theodore and his rival, the antipope Paschal, then a Roman archdeacon. Soon another election established Sergius I (687–701) as the legitimate pontiff. Theodore submitted instantly and acknowledged Sergius, but Paschal refused to yield.
