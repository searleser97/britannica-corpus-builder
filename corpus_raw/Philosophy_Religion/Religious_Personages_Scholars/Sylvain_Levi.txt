Sylvain Lévi,  (born March 28, 1863, Paris—died  Oct. 30, 1935, Paris), French Orientalist who wrote on Eastern religion, literature, and history and is particularly noted for his dictionary of Buddhism.
Appointed a lecturer at the school of higher studies in Paris (1886), he taught Sanskrit at the Sorbonne (1889–94) and wrote his doctoral dissertation, Le Théâtre indien (1890; “The Indian Theatre”), which became a standard treatise on the subject. After his appointment as professor at the Collège de France (1894–1935), he toured India and Japan (1897 and 1898) and published La Doctrine du sacrifice dans les Brâhmanas (1898; “The Doctrine of Sacrifice in the Brāhmaṇas”). Another book resulting from these travels was Le Népal: Étude historique d’un royaume hindou, 3 vol. (1905–08; “Nepal: Historical Study of a Hindu Kingdom”). In L’Inde et le monde (1926; “India and the World”), he discussed India’s role among nations.
Subsequent travels to East Asia (1921–23) generated his major work, Hôbôgirin. Dictionnaire du Bouddhisme d’après les sources chinoises et japonaises (1929; “Hōbōgirin. Dictionary of Buddhism Based on Chinese and Japanese Sources”), produced in collaboration with the Japanese Buddhist scholar Takakusu Junjirō.
Lévi also worked with the French linguist Antoine Meillet on pioneer studies of the Tocharian languages spoken in Chinese Turkistan in the 1st millennium ad. He determined the dates of texts in Tocharian B and published Fragments de textes koutchéens . . . (1933; “Fragments of Texts from Kucha”).
