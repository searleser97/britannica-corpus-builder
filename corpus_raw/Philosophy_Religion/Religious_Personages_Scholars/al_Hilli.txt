Al-Ḥillī, in full Jamāl ad-Dīn Ḥasan ibn Yūsuf ibn ʿAlī ibn Muṭhahhar al-Ḥillī,  (born Dec. 15, 1250, Ḥillah, Iraq—died Dec. 18, 1325), theologian and expounder of doctrines of the Shīʿī, one of the two main systems of Islam, the other being the Sunnī, which is the larger.
Al-Ḥillī studied law, theology, and the uṣūl, or principles of the faith, in the city of Ḥillah, an important centre for Shīʿī learning in the Sunnī territory of the ʿAbbāsid caliphate (the second Arab dynasty). A scion of a family of Shīʿī theologians, he became known as the “wise man of Ḥillah.” He also studied philosophy with Naṣīr ad-Dīn aṭ-Ṭūsī (d. 1274), a noted philosopher of his time.
Among al-Ḥillī’s more than 500 scholarly works on the Islamic faith are the al-Bāb al-ḥādī ʿashar (Treatise on the Principles of Shīʿite Theology, 1928) and the Sharḥ tajrīd al-iʿtiqād. These are standard references on Twelver Shīʿī beliefs and are still used as textbooks in Iran.
Attracted by the religious freedom of the Mongol Il-Khanid dynasty (the descendants of Hülegü, who sacked Baghdad in 1258), al-Ḥillī emigrated to Iran in 1305. There he was responsible for converting Öljeytü, the eighth Il-Khanid of Iran, from the Sunnī faith to Shīʿah. In 1305 Shīʿah was proclaimed the state religion of Iran. Al-Ḥillī was buried in Meshed.
