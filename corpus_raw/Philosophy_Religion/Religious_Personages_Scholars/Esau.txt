Esau, also called Edom,  in the Old Testament (Genesis 25:19–34; 27; 28:6–9; 32:3–21; 33:1–16; 36), son of Isaac and Rebekah, elder twin brother of Jacob, and in Hebrew tradition the ancestor of the Edomites.
At birth, Esau was red and hairy, and he became a wandering hunter, while Jacob was a shepherd. Although younger, Jacob dominated him by deception. At one time, when Esau returned from an unsuccessful hunt and was hungry, Jacob bought Esau’s birthright (i.e., the rights due him as the eldest son) for some red pottage (soup). When Isaac was dying, Jacob, with Rebekah’s help, cheated Esau out of his father’s blessing. Esau would have killed Jacob, but Jacob fled; when he returned 20 years later, Esau forgave him.
The story reflects the relationship of Israel and Edom. It sought to explain why Israel (in the time of the United Monarchy) dominated the kingdom of Edom, although the latter was older.
