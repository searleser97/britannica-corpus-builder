George William Mundelein,  (born July 2, 1872, New York, N.Y., U.S.—died  Oct. 2, 1939, Mundelein, Ill.), cardinal and archbishop of Chicago, a leading figure in the Americanization of the Roman Catholic church in the United States.
Mundelein was educated at seminaries in New York and Pennsylvania; he studied theology in Rome and was ordained there in June 1895. In 1909 he was named auxiliary bishop of Brooklyn, N.Y., and in 1915, without previous administrative experience, became archbishop of Chicago.
As archbishop, Mundelein refused to sanction national parishes for immigrant Roman Catholics—a measure designed to encourage their integration into the mainstream of U.S. culture—and he made English the language of instruction in parochial schools. He was created a cardinal by Pope Pius XI in 1924. Mundelein was a prominent figure at the International Eucharistic Congress held in Chicago in 1926, attended by Roman Catholics from around the world. He founded St. Mary of the Lake Seminary at Mundelein, Ill., a town near Chicago named in his honour.
