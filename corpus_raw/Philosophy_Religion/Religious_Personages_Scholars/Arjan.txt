Arjan,  (born 1563, Goindwal, Punjab, India—died  May 30, 1606, Lahore, Punjab, Mughal Empire [now in Pakistan]), the Sikh religion’s fifth Guru and its first martyr.
One of the greatest of the Sikh Gurus, Arjan took over the leadership of the Sikh community from his father, Guru Ram Das, in 1581 and successfully expanded it. He quickly completed the Harimandir,  the Golden Temple, at Amritsar, where all Sikhs could worship as they pleased. He expanded that great Sikh centre commercially and became the first Guru to serve as both temporal and spiritual head of the Sikhs. The social reform and missionary efforts by earlier Gurus were extended under him.
Arjan updated the scriptures of the Sikhs and prepared the Kartarpur Pothi, the volume upon which the canonical Adi Granth, or Guru Granth Sahib (“The Granth as the Guru”), the sacred scripture of the Sikhs, is based. He was also a prolific poet who created hymns of great lyrical quality.
Guru Arjun and the Sikh community prospered until the Mughal emperor Akbar died and his successor, Jahāngīr, began to oppress the Sikhs. Rumours against the Guru were spread by persons jealous of Arjan’s popularity, and he was taken before Jahāngīr, who fined him 200,000 rupees and ordered the elimination of all sections of the Adi Granth that gave offense to either Hinduism or Islam. Guru Arjan refused and was tortured to death. From that time on, the Sikhs, recognizing that they would be subject to further persecution by Mughal rulers, became more militaristic.
