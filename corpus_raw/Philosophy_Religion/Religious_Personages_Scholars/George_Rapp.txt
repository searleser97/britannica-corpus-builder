George Rapp, original name Johann Georg Rapp,  (born Nov. 1, 1757, Iptingen, Württemberg [Germany]—died  Aug. 7, 1847, Economy, Pa., U.S.), German-born American ascetic who founded the Rappites (Harmonists), a Pietist sect that formed communes in the United States.
A linen weaver and a lay preacher, “Father” Rapp emigrated to the United States in 1803 to escape persecution. He was joined by about 600 disciples, and by 1805 they established their first “Community of Equality” in Harmony, Pa. In search of land suitable for vineyards and orchards, the Rappites moved to southern Indiana (1814), where they established Harmony (or Harmonie), with 800 members. Shortly after coming to the United States, the Rappites renounced marriage, and eventually all persons lived in celibacy. After 10 years in Indiana, Rapp decided that the colony should move again. Harmony was sold in 1825 to the British utopian Robert Owen, who established a socialist community there and called it New Harmony. The Rappites moved to a site 18 miles (29 km) from Pittsburgh and established a new village called Economy (now Ambridge), Pa.
After Rapp’s death in 1847 the colony’s membership dwindled, resulting from the preference for celibacy and the lack of converts. In 1866 about 250 members survived, and by 1900 only a few remained. The community’s affairs were finally settled in 1905 by the U.S. Supreme Court, and the Rappites disbanded in 1906.
