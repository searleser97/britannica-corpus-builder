Geert Groote, also called Gerhard Groote, Gerard Groote, or Gerardus Magnus,  (born October 1340, Deventer, Lordship of Overijssel—died  Aug. 20, 1384, Deventer), Dutch priest and educator whose establishment of a centre for manuscript copiers led to the formation of the Brethren of the Common Life, a teaching order that was a major influence in the development of German humanism.
The son of wealthy parents, Groote studied for the priesthood at Paris. He later received a generous share of the revenues gathered by the cathedral at Cologne as a reward for his successful mission to the Pope in residence at Avignon, Fr. On this income Groote lived a life of ease and irresponsibility until 1374, when he suddenly changed course and underwent a profound spriritual conversion. Groote renounced worldly goods, turned over his house as a haven for poor women who wished to serve God, and began a period of intense meditation. In 1380 he came out of isolation to preach and attack clerical excesses and abuses throughout Holland. He soon gained a large following and continued his efforts until he died of the plague.
Earlier, in 1371, Groote had joined Florentius Radewunius (of the Church of St. Lebunus in Deventer) in gathering together at one residence a number of impoverished scholars who wished to earn income by copying manuscripts. Out of this grew the Brethren of the Common Life, an order approved by Pope Gregory XI. The Brethren’s houses spread rapidly throughout the Netherlands and Germany, and, as a teaching order, the Brethren influenced patterns of elementary and secondary education throughout Europe, stressing Humanistic studies and Latin and establishing graded schooling and new textbooks. Erasmus was one of many northern European scholars who studied under the Brethren during the late Middle Ages. The Brethren of the Common Life declined after the invention of printing and the rise of new teaching orders and universities, their last house closing in 1811.
