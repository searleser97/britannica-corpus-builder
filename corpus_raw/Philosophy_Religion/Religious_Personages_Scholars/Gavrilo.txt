Gavrilo, original name Gavrilo Dožič, orDožitch,  (born May 17, 1881, Morača, Montenegro—died  May 7, 1950, Belgrade), patriarch of the Serbian Orthodox Church (1938–50), noted for his anti-Nazi stand and, later, for his limited accommodations with the Communists.
Gavrilo was educated at Prizren in Serbia and at Athens and Istanbul. In 1910 he became bishop of Peć and in 1920 metropolitan of Crnagora and Primorje (Montenegro and the Littoral). Elected by 50 out of 59 votes in a secret ballot of bishops to the patriarchate of the Serbian Orthodox Church, vacant since the death of Patriarch Varnava on July 24, 1937, he was enthroned on Feb. 21, 1938.
Gavrilo was one of the instigators of the coup d’etat of March 27, 1941, that overthrew the pro-Axis government. After Germany had invaded Yugoslavia that same year, Gavrilo remained in his country but was arrested, interned first at monasteries, and then sent to the concentration camp at Dachau. Liberated on April 30, 1945, by the U.S. Army, he lived for a time in Rome, returning to Belgrade in November 1946. In December 1946 Gavrilo spoke at an all-Slav congress in Belgrade. A year later he called on the Orthodox clergy to cooperate with the government but, nevertheless, later refused to recognize the League of Serbian Priests, sponsored by the Communist Party. In July 1948, accompanied by Metropolitan Josip of Skopje, Gavrilo was present at the congress of the Orthodox churches in Moscow, but he refused to recognize the patriarch of Moscow and All-Russia as head of the Orthodox churches throughout the world.
