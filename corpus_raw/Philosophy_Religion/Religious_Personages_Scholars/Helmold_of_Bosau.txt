Helmold Of Bosau,   (born c. 1120, Lower Saxony [Germany]—died  after 1177, Bosau, Holstein [Germany]), German historian and priest who wrote Chronica Slavorum (Chronicle of the Slavs). Completed in about 1172, this work was a history of the lower Elbe River region from about 800 to 1170.
Educated at Brunswick (1139–42) under Gerold (later bishop of Oldenburg and Lübeck) and at the Augustinian monastery at Neumünster (1147–53), Helmold became a deacon (c. 1150) and priest (1156) at Bosau. Chronica Slavorum, written at Gerold’s request, recorded the Saxon colonization of the area east of the lower Elbe and the conversion to Christianity of its Slavic inhabitants. The Chronica is also important as a contemporary history of the reign (1142–80) of Henry the Lion, Duke of Saxony.
