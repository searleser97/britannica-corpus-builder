Pavel Alexandrovich Florensky,  (born Jan. 21 [Jan. 9, old style], 1882, Yevlakh, Yelizavetpolskaya Province, Russian Empire—died  Dec. 15, 1943, Siberia), Russian Orthodox theologian, philosopher, and mathematician.
In 1904 Florensky received a degree in philosophy and mathematics from Moscow University, and four years later he obtained his graduate degree from the Moscow Theological Academy, where he eventually taught. Ordained a priest in 1911, he went into exile during the Russian Revolution. When he returned to Moscow in 1919 to resume his work, he refused to renounce or conceal his priesthood in the face of official atheism. During the reign of Stalin in the 1930s, he was imprisoned several times and was banished to Siberia.
Florensky’s chief contribution to Russian Orthodox theology is his 1914 essay on theodicy entitled “The Pillar and the Ground of Truth,” in which he argued that only through nonrational, intuitive experience could a person become consubstantial with all of creation and thus encounter God’s reality and understand God’s truth. According to Florensky, rationalistic analysis separates man from creation because it objectifies the external world rather than unifying it.
