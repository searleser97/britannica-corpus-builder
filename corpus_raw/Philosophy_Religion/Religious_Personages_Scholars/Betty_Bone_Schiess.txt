Betty Bone Schiess, née Betty Bone,  (born April 2, 1923, Cincinnati, Ohio, U.S.—died October 20, 2017), American Episcopal priest who was at the forefront of the movement that led the church to permit the ordination of women.
Betty Bone received a bachelor’s degree from the University of Cincinnati in 1945 and a master’s from Syracuse (New York) University in 1947. After marriage the same year to William A. Schiess, she devoted the next two decades to the traditional roles of wife and mother.
In the late 1960s, influenced by the burgeoning women’s movement, the civil rights movement, and the antiwar movement, Schiess, with the assistance of the Syracuse chapter of the National Organization for Women, began a movement to eradicate sexism from the Episcopal church. In 1972 she was awarded a master of divinity degree from the Rochester Center for Theological Studies. When she sought ordination, however, her request was denied because of her sex. In 1974, together with 10 other American women in similar situations, she was ordained in Philadelphia by a group of retired bishops. The ensuing charges against Schiess in ecclesiastical court and her suit against the Episcopal church revealed a deeply ingrained bias against women within the church. To put an end to the difficulties, the Episcopal church voted in 1977 to allow the ordination of women. Schiess served as chaplain at Syracuse University (1976–78) and at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York (1978–79), and became a member of the New York Task Force on Life and Law. She was inducted into the National Women’s Hall of Fame in 1994. In 2003 Schiess wrote Why Me, Lord?: One Woman’s Ordination to the Priesthood with Commentary and Complaint.
