Jean Capréolus,  (born c. 1380, Rodez, Rouergue—died  April 6, 1444, Rodez), Dominican scholar whose Four Books of Defenses of the Theology of St. Thomas Aquinas (written 1409–33), generally known as the Defensiones, contributed to a revival of Thomistic theology and won for the author the sobriquet Prince of the Thomists. He began the project while lecturing at the University of Paris, where he later (1411, 1415) took degrees in theology. After some time in Toulouse, he returned (1426) to Rodez, where he completed the work.
