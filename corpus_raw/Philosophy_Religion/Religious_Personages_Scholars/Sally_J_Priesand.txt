Sally J. Priesand, in full Sally Jane Priesand,  (born June 27, 1946, Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.),  American rabbi who on June 3, 1972, became the first woman in the United States to be so ordained.
Priesand, who grew up in a Jewish family in Cleveland, as a teenager aspired to become a rabbi. She earned a bachelor’s degree from the University of Cincinnati in 1968 and won admittance to the rabbinic school at Hebrew Union College–Jewish Institute of Religion in Cincinnati. Although Priesand’s goal of becoming a rabbi was supported by her parents, she faced skepticism from administrative officials, teachers, and her fellow classmates. In 1972 she was ordained within the Reform movement and that same year she secured the position of assistant rabbi at Stephen Wise Free Synagogue in New York City. Believing she would not be promoted to senior rabbi because of her gender, she left that institution in 1979. Rejected by several temples because of her sex, she became a rabbi at Temple Beth El in Elizabeth, N.J. Three years later she became rabbi of Monmouth Reform Temple in Tinton Falls, N.J., a position she held until her retirement in 2006.
Priesand achieved a major milestone for women at the height of the women’s movement. At the time of her retirement, women still constituted a minority among rabbis, although their numbers continued to increase.
