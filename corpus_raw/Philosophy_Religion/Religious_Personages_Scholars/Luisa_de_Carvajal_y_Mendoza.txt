Luisa de Carvajal y Mendoza,  (born Jan. 2, 1568, Jaraicejo, Extremadura, Spainâ€”died  Jan. 2, 1614, London, Eng.), missionary who, moved by the execution of the Jesuit Henry Walpole in 1595, decided to devote herself to the cause of the faith in England.
With her share of the family fortune, Luisa founded a college for English Jesuits at Leuven, in the Spanish Netherlands (now Belgium), which was transferred in 1612 to Watten near Saint-Omer, where it remained until the suppression of the order. In 1605 she arrived in England and established herself under the protection of the Spanish ambassador, from whose house she carried on her activities. The same year she made herself conspicuous by her attentions to the Gunpowder Plot prisoners, accused of conspiracy to blow up King James I of England and Parliament. She was arrested in 1608, but the protection of the Spanish ambassador and the desire of the king to stand well with Spain secured her release. She died before attempts to banish her from England could prove successful.
