Thurstan, also spelled Turstin,  (born, Bayeux, Fr.—died  Feb. 6, 1140, Pontefract, Yorkshire, Eng.), archbishop of York whose tenure was marked by disputes over precedence with the see of Canterbury and with the Scottish bishoprics. He was made archbishop by King Henry I in 1114, but had to wait for consecration by Pope Calixtus II until October 1119, because he refused to profess obedience to Ralph, archbishop of Canterbury. His obduracy angered Henry, but the two were reconciled in 1120, partly through the help of Henry’s sister Adela. Thurstan was an energetic and effective archbishop, developing the parochial system and extending generous patronage toward the religious orders. He was involved in further disputes with Canterbury and also quarrelled with John, bishop of Glasgow, and with other Scottish prelates. In 1127, however, he consecrated Robert as bishop of St. Andrews, without insisting on a profession of obedience. He inspired the English army, consisting mainly of Yorkshiremen, that defeated the Scots in the Battle of the Standard (near Northallerton, Yorkshire) on Aug. 22, 1138.
