Saint Paul of The Cross, Italian San Paolo Della Croce,  original name Paolo Francesco Danei,  (born Jan. 3, 1694, Ovada, Republic of Genoa [Italy]â€”died  Oct. 18, 1775, Rome; canonized 1867; feast day October 19), founder of the order of missionary priests known as the Passionists.
In 1720 Paul dedicated his life to God and began to experience visions, in the last of which the Virgin Mary appeared to him. He was inspired by this vision to found a congregation devoted to the suffering of Christ on the cross, and his rule for the new order was approved in 1741 by Pope Benedict XIV and confirmed in 1769 by Clement XIV. Paul subsequently founded the Passionist Nuns at Corneto (modern Tarquinia); the order was approved by Clement XIV in 1770. By the time of his death, Paul had established 12 monasteries in Italy, and since then his institute has spread throughout the world.
