Blessed Victor III, original name Dauferi, Benedictine name Desiderius,  (born 1027, Benevento, principality of Benevento [Italy]—died September 16, 1087, Montecassino, principality of Capua; beatified July 23, 1887), ; feast day September 16), pope from 1086 to 1087.
Of noble birth, Dauferi entered the Benedictine monastery of Montecassino, where he changed his name to Desiderius and where in 1058 he succeeded Pope Stephen IX (X) as abbot. His rule at Montecassino marks the monastery’s golden age, for he promoted writing and manuscript illumination, established an important school of mosaic, and radically reconstructed the abbey, considered a major event in the history of Italian architecture. He was made cardinal priest by Pope Nicholas II in 1059 and papal vicar in southern Italy, where he negotiated peace between the Normans and the papacy.
Favoured by the cardinals and his predecessor, St. Gregory VII, Desiderius was chosen pope, but he declined the office, and the year 1085 passed without an election. On May 24, 1086, the cardinals proclaimed him pope against his will, but before his consecration was completed, he was driven from Rome by supporters of the Holy Roman emperor Henry IV, who had set up the antipope Clement III in 1084. Victor retired to Montecassino.
In March 1087 Victor convened a synod at Capua and resumed his papal authority. He received belated consecration in St. Peter’s, Rome, on May 9, but imperial support for Clement made it impossible for Victor to spend more than a few weeks in the city. He dispatched an army to Tunis, where it defeated the Saracens and compelled them to pay tribute to Rome. In August 1087 he held at Benevento a synod that excommunicated Clement; banned Hugues of Die, archbishop of Lyon, and Abbot Richard of Marseille as schismatics; and condemned lay investiture. Falling ill at the synod, Victor returned to Montecassino, where he died.
