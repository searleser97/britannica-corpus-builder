James Morison,  (born February 14, 1816, Bathgate, Linlithgowshire [now in West Lothian], Scotland—died November 13, 1893, Glasgow), Scottish theologian and founder of the Evangelical Union (Morisonians).
Licensed to preach in 1839, Morison won many converts to his view that Christ’s atonement saved nonbelievers as well as believers. This universalism, contrary to the Westminster Confession (a statement of beliefs based on the Reformation theology of John Calvin), led to a charge of heresy against Morison. In 1840 he was called to Kilmarnock, Ayrshire (now in East Ayrshire), where he became famous as an evangelist, but in 1841 the synod of the United Secession Church removed his name from its ministerial roll because of his beliefs. Morison and his father, Robert, with two others who shared his condemnation, became associates in a new denomination founded at Kilmarnock on May 16, 1843. Called the Evangelical Union, it trained its ministers first at Kilmarnock and then in Glasgow in a college that Morison served as president. In 1897 the Evangelical Union and the Scottish Congregationalists, totaling more than 90 congregations, united as the Congregational Union of Scotland. Morison was the author of biblical commentaries and several books on Christian doctrine, including The Nature of the Atonement (1841).
