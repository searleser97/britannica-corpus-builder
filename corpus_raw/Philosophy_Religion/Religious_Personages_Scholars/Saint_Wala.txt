Saint Wala,  (born c. 755—died  August 836, Bobbio [Italy]; feast day August 31), Frankish count, Benedictine abbot, and influential minister at the courts of the Holy Roman emperors Charlemagne and Louis I the Pious. He stood for imperial unity against the traditionalist party, which looked for partition of the emperors’ lands.
A cousin of Charlemagne, Wala helped to govern both Saxony and Italy. Although, as a convinced representative of the party standing for the maintenance of imperial unity, he was probably chiefly responsible for the decision of Charlemagne to crown his son, Louis, emperor in 813, he fell out of favour on the new ruler’s accession the following year and became a monk at Corbie. From about 821, restored to grace, he was a powerful influence at Louis’s court. He became abbot of Corbie in 826. When, in 829, Louis granted lands to his youngest son, Charles (the Bald), Wala and the imperial party opposed the emperor, seeing his action as a threat to the Ordinatio imperii of 817, which had decided against partition of the empire on Louis’s death. Exiled by Louis for supporting the rebellion against him in 830, Wala later (833) supported Louis’s son Lothair against his father; he may even have suggested Lothair’s appeal to Pope Gregory IV. Accompanying Lothair to Italy, Wala became abbot of Bobbio in 834.
