Hilarion Of Kiev,   (flourished  11th century), the first native metropolitan of Kiev, who reigned from 1051 to 1054, and the first known Kievan Rus writer and orator.
A priest, Hilarion became the second archbishop of Kiev, the chief city in Rus at that time. Although Kievan bishops had all previously been appointed by the patriarch of Constantinople, Hilarion was chosen by Prince Yaroslav I the Wise and an assembly of Rus bishops. Scholars are divided in interpreting his election, but it is likely that an agreement on the matter had been reached between the Rus and Greek hierarchies.
Hilarion’s importance to the Rus Church derives from the sentiments he expressed c. 1050 in his classically structured panegyric of Saint Vladimir (grand prince of Kiev 980–1015), the first Christian ruler of Kievan Rus and the institutor of Orthodoxy as the state religion. Entitled “Sermon on Law and Grace,” the encomium not only rhetorically extolled the monarch for implanting the true religion in his country but also eulogized the Slavic people. Recalling the historical events by which Saint Vladimir uprooted the pre-Christian Slavic cults so that Christian worship and monasticism could flourish, Hilarion fused local patriotism with the universality of Christian belief in the inexorable unfolding of a divine plan of salvation. He showed a wide familiarity with Greek patristic and apologetic literature and styled his work in the form of Byzantine imperial panegyrics. His appreciation of Greek Orthodoxy is manifested by his concept of the Rus Church as the Slavonic version of Byzantine Christian culture.
