John Mauropous,  (born c. 1000, Paphlagonia, Byzantine Empire [now in Turkey]—died c. 1075–81, Constantinople), Byzantine scholar and ecclesiastic, author of sermons, poems and epigrams, letters, a saint’s life, and a large collection of canons, or church hymns (many unpublished).
The chronology of Mauropous’ life is uncertain. He was a private tutor in Constantinople in the first quarter of the 11th century and was at court in Constantine IX’s reign (1042–55) at the instigation of his friend and pupil Michael Psellus. About 1050 he became metropolitan of Euchaita in Asia Minor; later he became a monk.
