William of Corbeil,  Corbeil also spelled Corbail, or Corbeuil,  (born c. 1060, –80, probably Corbeil, Fr.—died  Nov. 21, 1136, Canterbury, Kent, Eng.), archbishop of Canterbury from 1123 to 1136.
Educated at Laon, he entered the order of St. Augustine at the house of the Holy Trinity, Aldgate, London, and became prior of the Augustinian foundation at St. Osyth in Essex. After a long conflict with Thurstan, archbishop of York, he was consecrated archbishop of Canterbury. Three years later, after a dispute with the papal legate Cardinal John of Crema, William was appointed legate in England and Scotland, an important precedent in the history of the English church. William built the keep of Rochester Castle and finished the cathedral at Canterbury, which he dedicated with great pomp in May 1130. He crowned Stephen as king of England in 1135 at Westminster.
