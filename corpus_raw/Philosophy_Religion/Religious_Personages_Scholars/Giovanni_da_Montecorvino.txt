Giovanni da Montecorvino,  (born 1247, Montecorvino, Sicily—died  1328, Peking), Italian Franciscan missionary who founded the earliest Roman Catholic missions in India and China and became the first archbishop of Peking.
In 1272 Montecorvino was commissioned by the Byzantine emperor Michael VIII Palaeologus as an emissary to Pope Gregory X to negotiate the reunion of Greek and Roman churches. He began his missionary work in Armenia and Persia c. 1280. In 1289 Pope Nicholas IV sent him as emissary to the Il-Khan of Persia. From Tabriz, then the chief city of western Asia, Montecorvino moved down to the Madras region of India, from which he wrote (1292/93) the earliest noteworthy Western account of that region of the Indian seaboard known historically as the Coromandel Coast. In 1294 he entered Khanbaliq (Peking). His letters of 1305 and 1306 describe the progress of the Roman mission in the Far East—including opposition by the Nestorian Christians—and allude to the Roman Catholic community he had founded in India.
In 1307 Pope Clement V created him archbishop of Peking and patriarch of the Orient and to consecrate and assist him sent seven bishops, only three of whom survived the journey. A Franciscan tradition maintains that in 1311 Montecorvino baptized Khaishan Külüg, the third great khan (1307–11), and his mother. This event has been disputed, but he was unquestionably successful in northern and eastern China. He was apparently the only effective European proselytizer in medieval Peking, but the results of his mission were lost in the downfall of the Mongol Empire during the 14th century.
