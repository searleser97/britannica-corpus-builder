Artemidorus,  (flourished 100 bce, Ephesus, Lydia [now in Turkey]), Greek geographer whose systematic geography in 11 books was much used by the famed Greek geographer-historian Strabo (b. 64/63 bce). Artemidorus’s work is based on his itineraries in the Mediterranean and on the records of others. The work is known only from Strabo’s references to it and from fragments preserved by later authors and from the surviving part of an abridgment, dating possibly from the early 5th century ce, of his coastal guide to the Mediterranean and Euxine (Black) seas.
