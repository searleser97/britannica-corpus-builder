Khitān,  in Islam, circumcision of the male; by extension it may also refer to the circumcision of the female (properly khafḍ). Muslim traditions (Ḥadīth) recognize khitān as a pre-Islamic rite customary among the Arabs and place it in the same category as the trimming of mustaches, the cutting of nails, and the cleaning of the teeth with a toothpick.
The legal schools of Islam, however, do not agree on the exact importance of khitān. The Shāf ʿīyah school prescribes it for both males and females as obligatory (wājib), while the Mālikīyah school allows that it is meritorious and recommended (sunnah) but not essential. Nor is there consensus regarding the age at which khitān should be performed: some recommend the seventh day after birth, some forbid it before the age of 10, others simply require it before adulthood. Among the followers of the religion, khitān far outweighs the importance accorded it by the legalists. Particulars vary from one Muslim country to another, but everywhere khitān is a major and celebrated rite.
