Ḥuppa, also spelled Ḥuppah, or Chuppah, plural Ḥuppot, Ḥuppoth, or Ḥuppas,  in a Jewish wedding, the portable canopy beneath which the couple stands while the ceremony is performed. Depending on the local custom and the preference of the bride and groom, the ḥuppa may be a simple Jewish prayer shawl (ṭallit) suspended from four poles, a richly embroidered cloth of silk or velvet, or a flower-covered trellis. In ancient times ḥuppa signified the bridal chamber, but the canopy now symbolizes the home to be established by the newlyweds. In popular usage the term ḥuppa may refer to the wedding ceremony itself.
