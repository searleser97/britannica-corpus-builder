Brethren in Christ, also called River Brethren,  Christian church in the United States and Canada. It developed among European settlers along the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania who came to America about 1750 and who were primarily Anabaptists and Pietists. Known for many years as River Brethren, the church was not officially organized under the name Brethren in Christ until 1863, when the drafting of young men into the Union Army made necessary its formal organization as a body of conscientious objectors.
The church stands for equality of all members, though the ultimate authority in policy and doctrine is vested in a general conference held annually. There are six regional conferences, five in the United States and one in Canada.
The teachings of the church are generally conservative. The Brethren in Christ accept the Bible as the inspired Word of God and consider it the final authority for faith and practice. Adult baptism by immersion, partaking of the Lord’s Supper, and washing of members’ feet are all practiced. Other teachings include the expectation of the Second Coming of Christ and the general resurrection of the dead, nonconformity to the world, and nonresistance in war.
The church supports home missions and foreign missions. Internal disputes resulted in the establishment of two smaller groups: the Old Order, or Yorker, Brethren (1843) and the United Zion Church (1855).
