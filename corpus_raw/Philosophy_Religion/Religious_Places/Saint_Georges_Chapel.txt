Saint George’s Chapel,   part of Windsor Castle in the district of Windsor and Maidenhead, Berkshire, Eng. This chapel was designed for the Order of the Garter and was begun by Edward IV. It is one of the finest examples of the Perpendicular style of Gothic architecture in England. The chapel was built in two stages, the choir and its aisles being completed and roofed by 1483 and the nave by 1496; but the stone vaulting was not finished until 1528. Above the choir stalls hang the insignia of the Knights of the Garter, their swords, helmets, and banners; to the backs of the stalls are affixed their heraldic stall plates, forming a notable assemblage of heraldry from medieval times. The large west window with its late 15th-century stained glass and the painted roof bosses are among other remarkable features of the chapel.
St. George’s chapel ranks next to Westminster Abbey as a royal mausoleum, and it became customary for royal funerals to take place there. Among the royalty buried within the chapel are Edward IV, Henry VI, Henry VIII and Jane Seymour, Charles I, Edward VII and Queen Alexandra, and George V and Queen Mary.
