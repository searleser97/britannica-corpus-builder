Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand, and Polynesia, formerly Church of the Province of New Zealand,  an independent Anglican church that developed from missionary work begun in the 19th century. The first missionaries arrived in New Zealand from Australia in 1814. The work flourished, and in 1841 George Augustus Selwyn (1809â€“78) was appointed the first bishop of New Zealand, where he served until 1867. The church grew as white settlers moved to the country, and it also gained converts among the native Maori population. In 1857 it adopted its own constitution and became an independent church.
Although other denominations also established missions in New Zealand, the Anglican church remained the largest church. It consists of one province divided into several dioceses. In June 1990 in Dunedin, New Zealand, Penelope Jamieson became the first female Anglican bishop to head a diocese. The seat of the primate is in Christchurch.
