Saint Stephen’s Cathedral, also called Stephansdom, or Stephanskirche,  cathedral in Vienna that was burned out in the course of the Battle of Vienna in April 1945 and was reconstructed by 1952. Saint Stephen’s was established in 1147; only the west facade remains of the late Romanesque edifice that burned in 1258. A Gothic nave was built from 1304 to 1450, with a Gothic tower and spire on the south transept completed in 1433. A distinguishing exterior feature is the tiled roof in a coloured zigzag pattern.
