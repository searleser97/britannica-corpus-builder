Palazzo Vecchio, also called Palazzo della Signoria,  most important historic government building in Florence, having been the seat of the Signoria of the Florentine Republic in the 14th century and then the government centre of the Medici grand dukes of Tuscany. From 1865 to 1871 it housed the Chamber of Deputies of the Kingdom of Italy, and since 1872 it has been the town hall.
The Tuscan Gothic design of the Palazzo Vecchio has been traditionally attributed to Arnolfo di Cambio. It was constructed between 1298 and 1314 and had additions by Giorgio Vasari and Buontalenti in the late 16th century. The former completely reorganized and redecorated much of the interior. On the terrace facing the Piazza della Signoria are several famous examples of Renaissance sculpture: Donatello’s “Judith and Holofernes” (1456–57); a copy of Michelangelo’s “David” (1504; the original that once stood there is now in the Accademia); and “Hercules and Cacus” (1534) by Baccio Bandinelli.
