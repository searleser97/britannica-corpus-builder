General Council of Congregational Christian Churches,   Protestant church in the United States, organized in 1931 by a merger of the National Council of the Congregational Churches and the General Convention of the Christian Church. It was merged with the Evangelical and Reformed Church into the United Church of Christ in 1957.
The Congregational churches developed from the churches established by the settlers at Plymouth, Mass. (1620), and at Massachusetts Bay (1630). Local congregations were independent, and a national governing body was not established for many years, though the churches cooperated in many areas. In 1852 representatives from all the Congregational churches met in Albany, N.Y., to discuss a plan of union. In 1871 a national Congregational organization, the National Council, was established at Oberlin, Ohio, and national councils were held regularly from that date. At the time of the merger with the Christian Church in 1931, the Congregational churches had about 943,500 members.
The Christian Church developed from three independent groups that had withdrawn from the Methodist, Baptist, and Presbyterian denominations in the late 1700s and early 1800s. The three groups began cooperating a few years later in a General Council. The Bible was the only rule of faith, church government was congregational, and complete freedom of belief was allowed.
