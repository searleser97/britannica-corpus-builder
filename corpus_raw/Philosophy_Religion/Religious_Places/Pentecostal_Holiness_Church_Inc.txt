Pentecostal Holiness Church, Inc.,,   Protestant denomination organized in Falcon, N.C., in 1911 by the merger of the Fire-Baptized Holiness Church (organized in 1898 by several Pentecostal associations) and the Pentecostal Holiness Church (organized in 1900). A third group, the Tabernacle Pentecostal Church, joined the consolidation in 1915.
Unlike most other Pentecostal churches, the denomination permits candidates for baptism to “have the right of choice between the various modes as practised by the several evangelical denominations.” It even permits the baptism of infants. In matters of polity, it is decidedly less democratic than other Pentecostal bodies. Reflecting the Methodist Episcopal heritage of its Holiness constituents, the denomination is divided into conferences: general, annual, district, and missionary.
The General Board of Education oversees the operations of three church-related institutions of higher learning: Emmanuel College, a fully accredited academy and junior college in Franklin Springs, Ga., close to the denominational headquarters; Holmes Theological Seminary in Greenville, S.C.; and Southwestern Pentecostal Holiness College in Oklahoma City, Okla., which Oral Roberts, a faith healer and evangelist, helped to establish.
