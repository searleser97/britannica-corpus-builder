Church of Pakistan,  denomination inaugurated in Pakistan in 1970 and comprising former Anglican, Methodist, Scottish Presbyterian, and Lutheran churches and mission bodies. It is the only church in the world joining Lutherans with Anglicans, Methodists, and Presbyterians and one of three in which Anglicans and Methodists unite, the others being the churches of North and South India.
Next to the Roman Catholic church, the Church of Pakistan is the largest Christian body in a country that is 97 percent Muslim. Christian missions in what is now Pakistan originated in the 16th century, proselytizing among Hindus, Sikhs, and Muslims. Until the partition of India in 1947, missionary activities were concentrated on Hindu Punjabis. Members of the church are mostly from lower income levels, often landless farm workers.
In addition to initiating development projects, the Church of Pakistan provides teachers, social workers, and medical personnel. Most colleges and schools founded by this denomination have been nationalized. Two theological seminaries, two colleges, and a hospital remain affiliated with the church. Headquarters are in Sialkot, Pak.
