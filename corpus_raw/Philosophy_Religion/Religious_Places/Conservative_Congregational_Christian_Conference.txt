Conservative Congregational Christian Conference (CCCC),  U.S.-based evangelical Congregational denomination established in Chicago in 1948. Its founders were theologically conservative members of the General Council of Congregational Christian Churches (also known as the Congregational Christian Churches), then the mainline Congregational denomination, who were concerned about the spread of what they perceived to be heterodox views and movements in many Congregational churches. The CCCCâ€™s membership has grown steadily since its founding; in 2015 it claimed more than 40,000 members across 300 churches in the United States. Its headquarters are in Lake Elmo, Minnesota.
In keeping with the Congregational polity (church government), member congregations of the CCCC are autonomous, and their involvement with the CCCC is voluntary. The theological grounds for this practice is the idea that only Jesus Christ, not an ecclesiastical body, can be considered the head of a church. The CCCC is theologically conservative in the sense that its member congregations promote evangelical, biblical Christianity. However, it does allow a wide range of convictions and practices concerning certain issues, such as the ordination of women.
The CCCC provides both member and like-minded congregations with outlets for service, fellowship, and networking. It coordinates an active Missions Committee, publishes a newsletter (The FORESEE), hosts an annual conference, and provides a means by which potential clergy can be introduced to congregations.
