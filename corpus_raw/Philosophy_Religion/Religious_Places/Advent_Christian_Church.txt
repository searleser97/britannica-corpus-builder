Advent Christian Church,   one of several Adventist churches that evolved from the teachings in the late 1840s of William Miller. It was organized in 1860. Doctrinal emphasis is placed on the anticipated Second Coming of Christ and on the Last Judgment, after which the wicked will be destroyed and the chosen will be resurrected to live in a restored paradise on Earth. The church is congregational in polity and, unlike the Seventh-day Adventists, holds services on Sunday. In 1964 the former Life and Advent Union merged with the Advent Christian Church.
