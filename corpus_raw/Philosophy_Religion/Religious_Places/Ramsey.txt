Ramsey,  town (parish), Huntingdonshire district, administrative county of Cambridgeshire, historic county of Huntingdonshire, east-central England. The town serves an intensively cultivated hinterland on the southwest border of the Fens, a reclaimed region adjoining the North Sea.
Ramsey developed around a 10th-century Benedictine abbey, which was granted freedom from ecclesiastical and secular control before the Norman Conquest (1066). The abbey was an early English seat of learning, with a library of Hebrew books. After the dissolution of the monasteries (1536â€“39), its demesnes were granted to Sir Richard Cromwell, ancestor of Oliver Cromwell. A grammar school now occupies part of the site of the abbey. Pop. (2001) 8,047; (2011) 8,479.
