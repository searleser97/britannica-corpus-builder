Orthodox Church of Poland, in full Autocephalous Orthodox Church of Poland,  ecclesiastically independent member of the Eastern Orthodox communion, established in 1924 to accommodate the four million Orthodox Christians residing in the vast Ukrainian and Byelorussian territories acquired by Poland after World War I. As the new political situation made it difficult for these Orthodox communities to maintain canonical dependence on the patriarchate of Moscow, the Polish government strongly supported, against the protests of Patriarch Tikhon of Moscow, the creation of an autocephalous church in Poland. After World War II, however, most of the areas were returned to the Soviet Union, and the bishops were accepted back into the jurisdiction of Moscow; no more than 350,000 Orthodox remained in Polish territory. In 1948 the Polish Orthodox Church received a new charter of autocephaly from Patriarch Alexis of Moscow. The metropolitan of Warsaw currently oversees six local dioceses and a diocese abroad: Warsaw and Bielsk, Bialystok and Gdansk, Łódź and Poznan, Wrocław and Szczecin, Przemysl and Gorlice, Lublin and Chelm, and Rio de Janeiro and Olinda-Recife.
