Cumberland Presbyterian Church,  denomination organized in 1810 by a group of Presbyterians on the Kentucky–Tennessee frontier who left the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. The immediate cause of the separation was a religious revival in the Kentucky area (1799–1802) that brought many converts into the church and led to a shortage of ordained ministers. The Cumberland Presbytery of the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. ordained some men who were considered by the church’s Synod of Kentucky to be unqualified because they lacked education. The Synod of Kentucky dissolved the Cumberland Presbytery in 1806, and four years later some of the rejected ministers organized the independent Cumberland Presbytery, which grew rapidly and developed into the Cumberland Presbyterian Church. This church stressed evangelism, repudiated predestination, and avoided highly centralized authority in their church government.
Early in the 20th century the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. revised its Confession of Faith and included interpretations of predestination that the Cumberland Presbyterian Church found acceptable. Negotiations for union resulted in a majority of the Cumberland Presbyterians rejoining the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. in 1906. Members who rejected the merger elected to continue as the Cumberland Presbyterian Church. In 2005 the Cumberland Presbyterian Church reported about 82,000 members and more than 700 congregations. Headquarters are in Memphis, Tenn.
In 1874 a separate Colored Cumberland Presbyterian Church was established for African American members. This group, now called the Cumberland Presbyterian Church in America, in 1996 reported more than 15,000 members and about 150 congregations and is headquartered in Huntsville, Ala.
