Old Catholic Church of the Netherlands, also called Jansenist Church of Holland, Dutch Oud-Katholieke Kerk van Nederland,  small independent Roman Catholic church in the Netherlands that dates from the early 18th century. A schism developed in the Roman Catholic Church in Holland in 1702 when Petrus Codde, archbishop of Utrecht, was accused of heresy for suspected sympathy with Jansenism, a heresy emphasizing Godâ€™s grace and predestination, which was condemned by Pope Alexander VII in 1656. Many of the Dutch clergy and laity remained loyal to Codde and left the Roman Catholic Church. Several French Jansenists subsequently settled in Holland and joined the small group of Dutch Jansenists. In 1723 the church elected Cornelius Steenhoven as its bishop, and he was subsequently consecrated by the missionary bishop of Babylon, Dominique-Marie Varlet. The church bases its claim to the apostolic succession of its bishops upon this event.
Though never large, the church continued in Holland and became important in the Old Catholic movement after 1870, when many Roman Catholics disagreed with the decision concerning papal infallibility reached by the First Vatican Council. Groups that left the Roman Catholic Church organized national Catholic churches in several countries and received consecration of their bishops from a bishop of the Jansenist Church of Holland.
In the 20th century the Old Catholic Church of the Netherlands has an archbishop (at Utrecht) and two bishops (at Deventer and Haarlem). The liturgy has been in the Dutch language since 1910, and in 1922 the requirement of clerical celibacy was discontinued. The archbishop of Utrecht presides at meetings of the Union of Utrecht, an organization formed in 1889 of all Old Catholic bishops, which is accepted as the highest authority for Old Catholics. In the late 20th century the Old Catholic Church of the Netherlands reported 12,000 members.
