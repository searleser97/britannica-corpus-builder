Pachacamac,  large pre-Columbian ruin located in the Lurin Valley on the central coast of present-day Peru. The earliest major occupation and construction of Pachacamac dates to the Early Intermediate Period (c. 200 bc–ad 600) and to a culture generally known as Early Lima (Maranga, Interlocking style). The terraced adobe pyramid and temple known as the Temple of Pachacamac belongs to this time and culture, and Pachacamac’s fame as the seat of an oracle probably began in the Early Intermediate Period. During the Middle Horizon (ad 600–1000) it continued as a major centre and place of pilgrimage and was probably the principal establishment of the Huari Empire on the coast. In late pre-Columbian times the Inca constructed the large Temple of the Sun at the site, and the Oracle of Pachacamac, to which the early Spanish explorers refer, probably was associated with a shrine in this temple. The shrine and temple were sacked by Francisco Pizarro’s soldiers during the Spanish conquest (c. 1532).
