Presbyterian Church in America (PCA),  theologically conservative U.S. evangelical Presbyterian denomination founded in 1973. In the first quarter of the 21st century, the denomination claimed more than 340,000 members and 1,400 churches, making it the second largest Presbyterian denomination in the U.S., after the more liberal Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.). Its headquarters are in Lawrenceville, Georgia.
In the early 1970s the former Presbyterian Church in the United States, then a major Presbyterian denomination in the American South, was riven by disagreements over such issues as the ordination of women and the role of tradition in liturgy. At a December 1973 meeting in Birmingham, Alabama, theological conservatives formed the National Presbyterian Church, which immediately claimed 41,000 members. The denomination’s present name was adopted the following year. In 1982 the PCA welcomed another denomination, the Reformed Presbyterian Church, Evangelical Synod.
The PCA’s doctrine is rooted in the Westminster Confession and the Westminster Larger and Shorter Catechisms. It relies heavily on the authority of Scripture and on a view of grace that is grounded in the Reformed tradition, which holds that humankind is totally depraved and that God’s grace is irresistible to those God has elected to salvation. The ordination of women is not permitted. The denomination is governed at the local level by presbyters, or elders; at the regional level by presbyteries; and at the church-wide level by a general assembly.
The denomination operates Covenant College in Lookout Mountain, Georgia, and Covenant Theological Seminary in St. Louis, Missouri.
