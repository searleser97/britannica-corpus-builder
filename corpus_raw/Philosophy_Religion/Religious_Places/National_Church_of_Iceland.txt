National Church of Iceland,   established, state-supported Evangelical Lutheran Church of Iceland. Christian missionaries came to the country in the late 10th century, and about 1000 the Althing (the national Parliament and high court) averted a civil war between pagans and Christians by deciding that the country’s population should be Christian. The first Icelandic bishop was consecrated in 1056.
Norway gained control over independent Iceland in the 13th century, and in 1380 Norway and Denmark were united. The Protestant Reformation was brought to Iceland by Christian III, king of Norway and Denmark (1534–59), who gradually overcame the Icelandic people’s resistance and by 1550 had established Lutheranism as the official religion.
The outstanding Icelandic Reformation scholar was Gudbrandur Thorláksson, bishop of Hólar for 56 years. He wrote or prepared for publication many religious works in the Icelandic language, including the Bible (1584).
In 1918 Iceland became an independent state under the Danish king, and in 1944 the Republic of Iceland was founded. The historic relationship of the state and the Evangelical Lutheran Church was maintained, although freedom of religion exists for all other congregations. In the 20th century a very small percentage of the people took part in church activities, although most Icelandic citizens remained official members of the church. The state gives financial support to the church but allows it considerable freedom. The bishop is elected by pastors and members of the theological faculty. The one diocese is divided into provostries (districts), which are subdivided into parishes. A church congress made up of elected members advises the church.
