Anglican Church of Australia, formerly (until 1981) Church Of England In Australia,  independent Australian church within the Anglican Communion. It developed from the churches established by the English settlers in Australia in the 18th century. The first settlers, convicts sent from England to settle the country in 1788, were accompanied by one chaplain. Subsequently, more settlers and priests went to Australia. For many years the bishop of London was officially responsible for all British subjects outside Britain, but in 1814 Australia was included in the area of the new bishop of Calcutta. In 1836 the diocese of Australia was founded, and William Grant Broughton, who went to Australia in 1829, was consecrated as the first bishop. A period of expansion and church building then occurred, and in 1847 Broughton became bishop of Sydney when the dioceses of Melbourne, Adelaide, and Newcastle were established with their own bishops.
Over the years the church continued to grow as the population of Australia increased and expanded into new territories. Additional dioceses were established, and eventually five provinces of the church were organized, each composed of several dioceses. General Synods of the entire church were held every five years, with the primate of Australia, elected from the diocesan bishops, as president. For many years, however, the Australian church did not attain complete independence from the Church of England, because it lacked a constitution that clearly defined the legislative powers of the General Assembly. Dioceses and provinces experienced considerable independence. After many years of discussion and several unsuccessful attempts, a constitution was accepted in 1959, and the Church of England in Australia became autonomous in 1962.
