Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem,  autocephalous, or ecclesiastically independent, Eastern Orthodox patriarchate, fourth in honorific seniority after the churches of Constantinople, Alexandria, and Antioch. Since the beginning of Muslim rule in the 7th century, it has been the main custodian of the Christian holy places in Jerusalem.
Whereas the original Judaeo-Christian community, described in the Book of Acts (1â€“15) and headed by St. James, seems to have disappeared after the sack of Jerusalem by the Romans (ad 130), a new Christian Jerusalem was revived in the 4th century. It became a great centre of Christian religious life and pilgrimage and consequently was made a patriarchate by the Council of Chalcedon (451).
Under the rule of the crusaders, Western clergy acquired a predominant position in the holy places, but the Eastern Christians never abandoned the shrines. Under subsequent Ottoman rule, Greek monks, Syrians of various confessions, and Georgian, Armenian, Coptic, and Egyptian monks and Franciscan Friars struggled to acquire and preserve the right of worship in the various places.
The Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem embraces several scores of thousands of Arabs in Israel and Jordan. The patriarch and bishops, however, are all Greek and are drawn from the Brotherhood of the Holy Sepulchre, a body with monasteries in and near the holy places; this policy has been a cause of tension with the Arab population, from which the local married clergy is recruited. The liturgy is in Greek in the monasteries and in Arabic in the parish churches.
