Bulgarian Catholic Church,   an Eastern Catholic church of the Byzantine rite, in communion with Rome since 1859.
Christians since 864, the Bulgarians were conquered by the Byzantines early in the 11th century and followed Constantinople (now Istanbul) in the break with Rome (1054). In 1767, after more than four centuries of Ottoman rule in Bulgaria, which had placed Bulgarian Christians under the direct administration of the patriarch of Constantinople and a Greek clergy, a number of Bulgars decided to free themselves of Greek domination by seeking union with Rome. Joseph Sokolsky was consecrated the first Bulgarian Catholic prelate in 1859; and, although he was soon afterward abducted by the Russians and interned for 18 years, the Bulgarian Catholic Church grew to number 80,000 faithful. By 1872, however, 60,000 of these returned to Orthodoxy, and the number of Catholics dwindled to a few thousand in the late 20th century.
