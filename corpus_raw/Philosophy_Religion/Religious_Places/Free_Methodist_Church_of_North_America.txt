Free Methodist Church of North America,  Holiness church in the Arminian-Wesleyan tradition that emphasizes the doctrine of sanctification, a postconversion process of spiritual and moral growth through prayer, Bible study, interaction with fellow believers, and simplicity of worship and lifestyle. The church was organized in 1860 by the Reverend B.T. Roberts and several associates after they were expelled from the Methodist Episcopal Church, which they had criticized for not maintaining the original standards of Methodism. In addition to sanctification, the Free Methodist Church stresses evangelical beliefs, such as the Virgin Birth of Jesus. In 1960 the Holiness Movement Church of Canada merged with the Free Methodist Church of North America. The churchâ€™s name derives from its rejection of the practice in some churches of renting pews to provide income.
In the first decade of the 21st century the church reported more than 75,000 members and more than 1,000 congregations in the United States. Headquarters are in Indianapolis, Ind. The Canadian congregations of the Free Methodist Church of North America gained autonomy in 1990, forming the Free Methodist Church in Canada. The Canadian church reported about 7,600 members and some 150 congregations in the first decade of the 21st century. Headquarters are in Mississauga, Ont.
