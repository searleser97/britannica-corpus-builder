Hōryū Temple, Japanese Hōryū-ji, also called Ikarugadera,  Japanese Buddhist temple complex in the town of Ikaruga, northwestern Nara ken (prefecture), west-central Honshu, Japan. One of the Seven Great Temples of Nara, the Hōryū is also the centre of the Shōtoku sect of Buddhism. The temple was one of some 48 Buddhist monuments in the area that were collectively designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1993.
Beginning about ad 600, a number of Buddhist monuments were constructed by order of the prince Shōtoku (Shōtoku Taishi), regent of the empress Suiko. These structures included both palaces and temples built in the style of Chinese Buddhist architecture. The original Hōryū Temple was built between 601 and 607. A fire in 670 destroyed the site, which was subsequently rebuilt and enlarged. Several structures—a five-story pagoda, the chū-mon (“middle gate”), part of the enclosing rectangular corridor, and the kondō (“main hall”)—have survived from that rebuilding and are among the oldest extant wooden structures in the world. Many of Hōryū Temple’s 45 buildings are now listed as National Treasures of Japan. Because structures were added from the 7th through the 19th century, the monuments of the Hōryū Temple area are regarded as a representation of the growth of Buddhism on the Japanese archipelago.
The Hōryū compound amassed a large collection of Buddhist as well as secular art over the centuries. Much of this venerated Shōtoku after his death in 622. A large quantity of these objects were moved in the 1880s to the Hōryū-ji Treasure House on the grounds of the Tokyo National Museum. In 1941, commemorating the 1,350th anniversary of the death of Shōtoku, a museum was built in Ikaruga to house other works of art, religious objects, and artifacts found in the monuments of the region.
