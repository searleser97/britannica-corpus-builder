Anglican Church of Southern Africa,  independent church that is part of the Anglican Communion. It developed from the work of British clergy among the British soldiers and settlers in the Cape of Good Hope in the late 18th and 19th centuries. The bishop of Calcutta, India, was at first responsible for the area, but in 1847 Robert Gray was consecrated the first bishop of Cape Town. Through his work the church grew, and additional dioceses were established. In 1853 he became metropolitan (archbishop) of South Africa.
Gray had been influenced by the Oxford Movement in the Church of England, which emphasized the Roman Catholic heritage of the church. Anglicanism in South Africa reflected this influence. One result has been the establishment of branches of several Anglican religious communities in South Africa. Attempting to minister to the country’s black population, the church actively opposed the government’s policy of apartheid (enforced separation for whites and blacks) until the policy was abolished.
Formerly the Church of the Province of Southern Africa, it changed its name in 2006. The church claims a membership of about 3.5 million throughout 25 dioceses in 6 southern African countries and on the island of St. Helena. Archbishop Thabo Cecil Makgoba was installed as metropolitan of the church in 2008.
