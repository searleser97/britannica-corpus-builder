Somapura Mahavira, (Sanskrit: “Great Monastery”)  8th-century Buddhist monastery in the village of Paharpur, near Rajshahi, northwestern Bangladesh. Covering almost 27 acres (11 hectares) of land, it is one of the largest monasteries south of the Himalayas. Through the 17th century it was an important intellectual centre that was occupied alternately by Buddhists, Jains, and Hindus. Clues to its various inhabitants are found on artwork contained within the Somapura Mahavira’s thick outer walls.
Each side of the monastery measures some 900 feet (270 metres) in length and is composed of monks’ cells; the structure holds more than 170 such cells and 92 altars of worship. Within the walls is a courtyard containing the remains of a traditional Buddhist stupa. Evidence of other sacred objects and shrines is found throughout, including the Jain chaturmukhar structure, which displays the artistic and religious influences of the monastery’s three main residential groups: images of Jain deities abound on its main walls, and Buddhist terra-cotta artwork and sacred Hindu sculptures are found on its base walls.
Somapura Mahavira was one of the few Buddhist monasteries to survive the Muslim invasion of South Asia. The historic and cultural value of the immense quadrangular structure was first recognized by the British scholar Buckman Hamilton, who studied its remains in the early 19th century. More than a century later, in 1919, Somapura Mahavira was proclaimed a protected archaeological site, and excavations were begun four years later. In 1985 the monastery was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site.
