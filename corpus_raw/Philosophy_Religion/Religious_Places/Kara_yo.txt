Kara-yō,   (Japanese: “Chinese style”), one of the three main Japanese styles of Buddhist temple architecture in the Kamakura period (1192–1333). Kara-yō originally followed Chinese forms that featured strict symmetry on a central axis. The word kara-yō is written with the character that stands for the Chinese T’ang dynasty (618–907), but the style seems to have represented the official building code of the Southern Sung dynasty ruling from Hang-chou (1127–1279). Sectarian use of the kara-yō style began in the mid-13th century in Japan, notably at the Zen monasteries of Engaku, Daitoku, and Kenchō. Although there was a determined effort to adopt the style in complete and correct form, the verticality of the original became tempered by the Japanese preference for the horizontal.
Buildings constructed in the kara-yō style are impressive for their decorativeness and for the complex multiplication of their parts. One of the style’s most important features is the use of a series of complex brackets, rather than columnal axes, to support the eaves. The structural ingenuity of the style was masked by the ornamental effect, while bracketing itself sometimes became pretentious. Kara-yō gradually merged with the native architectural style to constitute a basis for all later temple building in Japan.
