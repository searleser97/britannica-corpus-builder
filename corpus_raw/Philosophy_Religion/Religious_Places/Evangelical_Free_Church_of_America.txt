Evangelical Free Church of America,  fellowship of independent Christian churches in the United States that was organized in 1950 and that developed from several free-church groups made up of members of Scandinavian descent. The Swedish Evangelical Free Mission (later renamed Swedish Evangelical Free Church) was organized in Boone, Iowa, in 1884 by several churches with members of Swedish descent. The present church was organized in 1950 by a merger of the Swedish Evangelical Free Church and the Evangelical Free Church Association, which had formerly been known as the Norwegian and Danish Evangelical Free Church Association.
The church government of the Evangelical Free Church is congregational. Each local congregation is self-governing and elects delegates to the annual conference, which is an advisory body that does not control the activities or beliefs of the local congregations. Church members are expected to have experienced conversion and to live a Christian life, but considerable freedom is allowed in interpretation of doctrine. The church is a member of the National Association of Evangelicals. It reported 350,000 members and more than 1,400 congregations in 2003. Headquarters are in Minneapolis, Minn.
A related body, the Evangelical Free Church of Canada, reported more than 8,400 members and 140 congregations in 2004 and is headquartered in Langley, B.C.
