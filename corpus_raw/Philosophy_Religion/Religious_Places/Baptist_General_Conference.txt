Baptist General Conference,   conservative Baptist denomination that was organized in 1879 as the Swedish Baptist General Conference of America; the present name was adopted in 1945. It developed from the work of Gustaf Palmquist, a Swedish immigrant schoolteacher and lay preacher who became a Baptist in 1852. He established the first Swedish Baptist Church in Rock Island, Ill., that same year. Palmquist and other Swedish Baptists worked in several Midwestern states among Swedish immigrants. The movement received assistance from the American Baptist Home Mission Society and the American Baptist Publication Society for several years, until the Swedish Baptists became self-supporting. After World War I, the Swedish language was gradually replaced by English in worship services, and persons other than Swedes became members of the church.
The Baptist General Conference is generally considered to be theologically conservative, although the right of individuals to differ in their beliefs is respected. Bethel College and Seminary in St. Paul, Minn., is owned and operated by the conference. The work of the denomination is carried out through several boards; a general conference is held annually. Headquarters are in Chicago, Ill.
