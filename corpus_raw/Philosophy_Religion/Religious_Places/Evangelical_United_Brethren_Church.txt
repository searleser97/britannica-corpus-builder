Evangelical United Brethren Church (EUB),   Protestant church formed in 1946 by the merger of the Evangelical Church and the Church of the United Brethren in Christ. Both of these churches were essentially Methodist in doctrine and church government, and both originated among German-speaking people in Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia after the American Revolution.
The doctrine of the Evangelical United Brethren Church was contained in The Confession of Faith (1962), which was a continuation of the creedal statements of the two groups that merged in 1946. Personal salvation was emphasized, but the church did not stress doctrine and was ecumenical in outlook. In 1966 it approved a plan of union with The Methodist Church, and in 1968 they formed the United Methodist Church (q.v.).
