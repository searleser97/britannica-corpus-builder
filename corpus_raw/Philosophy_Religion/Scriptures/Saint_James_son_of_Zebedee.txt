St. James, also called James, son of Zebedee, or James the Greater,  (born, Galilee, Palestine—died 44 ce, Jerusalem; feast day July 25), one of the Twelve Apostles, distinguished as being in Jesus’ innermost circle and the only apostle whose martyrdom is recorded in the New Testament (Acts 12:2).
James and his younger brother, St. John the Apostle, are designated Boanerges (from the Greek boanerges), or “Sons of Thunder” (Mark 3:17), perhaps because of their characteristic fiery zeal (Mark 9:38 and Luke 9:54). With Saints Peter and Andrew, James and John were the first four disciples whom Jesus called (Mark 1:16–19) and whose question (“Tell us, when will this [the destruction of the Temple] be, and what will be the sign that all these things are about to be accomplished?”) sparks Jesus’ eschatological (pertaining to the end-time) discourse in Mark 13.
As a member of the inner circle, James witnessed the raising of Jairus’s daughter from the dead (Mark 5:37 and Luke 8:51), the Transfiguration (Mark 9:2), and Jesus’ agony in the Garden of Gethsemane (Mark 14:33 and Matthew 26:37). James and John asked Jesus to let them sit, one at his right and one at his left, in his future glory (Mark 10:35–40), a favour that Jesus said was not his to grant. James was beheaded by order of King Herod Agrippa I of Judaea; according to Spanish tradition, his body was taken to Santiago de Compostela, where his shrine attracts Christian pilgrims from all over the world.
