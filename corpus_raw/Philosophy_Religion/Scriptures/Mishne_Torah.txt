Mishne Torah,   extensive commentary on the Talmud, composed in the 12th century by the renowned Jewish philosopher and scholar Moses Maimonides. Each of its 14 volumes deals with a group of laws covering one subject. Among the subjects are ethical conduct, civil laws, torts, marriage and divorce, and gifts to the poor.
Maimonides intended the Mishne Torah to combine religious law and philosophy and to serve as a code of laws that teaches as well as prescribes conduct. He attempted to make the Mishne Torah accessible to as many readers as possible, rather than restricting it for use only by scholars. Readers are encouraged to probe into the rationale underlying the laws. Like the Talmud that is its base, the Mishne Torah contains instruction in secular subjects, such as physics, astronomy, dietetics, and psychology.
