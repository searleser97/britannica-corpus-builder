George Foot Moore,  (born Oct. 15, 1851, West Chester, Pa., U.S.—died  May 16, 1931, Cambridge, Mass.), American Old Testament scholar, theologian and Orientalist, whose knowledge and understanding of the rabbinical source literature was extraordinary among Christians.
Graduated from Yale College in 1872 and from Union Theological Seminary in 1877, in 1878 Moore was ordained in the Presbyterian ministry and until 1883 was pastor of the Putnam Presbyterian Church, Zanesville, Ohio. He was Hitchcock professor of the Hebrew language and literature at Andover Theological Seminary, 1883–1902. In 1902 he became professor of theology and in 1904 professor of the history of religion at Harvard University.
Moore’s chief critical work dealt both with the Hexateuch (the first six books of the Old Testament) and, more particularly, the Book of Judges. He was also the author of The Literature of the Old Testament (1913), History of Religions, 2 vol. (1913–19), Metempsychosis (1914) and, perhaps his greatest work, Judaism in the First Centuries of the Christian Era, 3 vol. (1927–30). He was a leading figure in the establishment of the Harvard Theological Review in 1908, serving as editor (1908–14, 1921–31).
