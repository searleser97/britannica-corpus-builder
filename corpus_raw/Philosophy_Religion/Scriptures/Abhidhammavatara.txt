Abhidhammavatara, (Pali: “Introduction to the Abhidhamma”)  the earliest effort at systematizing, in the form of a manual, the doctrines dealt with in the Abhidhamma (scholastic) section of the Theravada Buddhist canon. The Abhidhammavatara was written in Pali, apparently in the 5th century, by the poet and scholar Buddhadatta in the region of the Kaveri River, in southern India.
Following the closing of the canon in the final centuries bc, a number of commentaries (known in Pali as atthakatha) on particular canonical texts appeared and culminated in those produced by Buddhadatta’s contemporary, Buddhaghosa. In the Abhidhammavatara Buddhadatta then both summed up and gave an original systematization to that part of the commentary literature dealing with Abhidhamma. (Among his other works is the Vinaya-vinicchaya [“Analysis of the Vinaya”], which similarly summarizes the commentaries on the vinaya [monastic discipline] section of the canon.)
The Abhidhammavatara is written largely in verse and has 24 chapters. To a certain extent it was superseded in the 12th century by Anuruddha’s Abhidhammattha-sangaha.
