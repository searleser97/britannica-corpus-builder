Piotr Skarga, in full Piotr Skarga Poweski,  (born February 1536, Grójec, Masovia—died  Sept. 27, 1612, Kraków), militant Jesuit preacher and writer, the first Polish representative of the Counter-Reformation.
After a difficult childhood during which both his parents died, he studied at Jagiellonian University, then became rector of a parish school in Warsaw. After some travel, he became a parish priest in Lwów. Subsequently, he travelled to Rome, joined the Society of Jesus, and moved to Vilna, where he enjoyed considerable success in converting Protestants to Roman Catholicism. He became the first rector of the University of Vilna in 1579, when it was created from the old Jesuit academy there. He next went to Kraków, where he eventually became court chaplain to King Sigismund III Vasa. There he became famous as a powerful speaker and writer on religious subjects. Though his forthrightness in condemning the public and private sins of the court could have exposed him to reprisals, he never hesitated to speak his mind. An ardent believer in his faith, he was no less intolerant than others of his time.
Kazania sejmowe (1597; “Diet Sermons”) is considered Skarga’s best work. These sermons are said to have been delivered before the King and his Diet. Other works include Żywoty świętych (1579; “The Lives of Saints”), still widely read in Poland today, and collections of sermons such as Kazania na niedziele i święta (“Sermons for Sundays and Holidays”) and Kazania przygodne (“Incidental Sermons”).
