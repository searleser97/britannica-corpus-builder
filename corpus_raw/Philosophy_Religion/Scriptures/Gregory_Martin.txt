Gregory Martin,  (born c. 1540, Maxfield, Sussex, England—died  October 28, 1582, Reims, France), Roman Catholic biblical scholar who served as the principal translator of the Latin Vulgate Bible into English for the Douai-Reims Bible. This version was the basis for Bishop Richard Challoner’s revised editions (1749, 1750, 1752), which were in turn the basis for the standard Catholic Bible in English until the 20th century. Martin’s phraseology influenced the Anglican translators of the Authorized, or King James, Version (1611).
One of the earliest students at St. John’s College, Oxford, Martin became proficient in Greek and Hebrew and befriended Edmund Campion, who was converted to Catholicism partly because of Martin’s influence and was eventually declared a saint. Martin was a tutor (1569–70) to the 4th duke of Norfolk’s sons, studied theology at William (later Cardinal) Allen’s college for English Catholics at Douai (then in the Spanish Netherlands, now in France), and was ordained a priest in 1573. He taught intermittently at that college until 1582 and aided Allen in founding the English College in Rome (1579). Though he worked under Allen’s direction and was assisted by other Oxford-educated scholars, Martin prepared most of the Douai-Reims translation himself. He died of tuberculosis as his New Testament was being printed in 1582; his translation of the Old Testament was not published until 1609–10.
