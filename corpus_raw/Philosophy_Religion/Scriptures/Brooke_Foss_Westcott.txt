Brooke Foss Westcott,  (born Jan. 12, 1825, near Birmingham, Warwickshire, Eng.â€”died  July 27, 1901, Auckland Castle, Durham), Anglican bishop of Durham, Eng., and biblical scholar who collaborated with Fenton J.A. Hort on an influential critical edition of the Greek text of the New Testament.
Westcott took a degree at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1848 and was elected a fellow of the college in 1849. He left Cambridge in 1852 for a post at Harrow, where he earned a distinguished reputation as a lecturer and scholar during a 17-year tenure.
In 1870 Westcott became regius professor of divinity at Cambridge, a position he retained even after being named bishop of Durham in 1890. The Westcott-Hort New Testament appeared in 1881 after nearly 30 years of work and became a major source for the English Revised Version of the Bible published the same year. Westcott also wrote commentaries on the gospel and epistles of St. John, and his History of the New Testament Canon (1855) was for many years a standard work in biblical scholarship.
In 1889 Westcott convened a conference of Christians from all over Europe to consider the arms race then afflicting the continent. From this conference emerged the Christian Social Union, with Westcott as its president. His social concerns found other outlets in the promotion of missionary work, which he enthusiastically supported as bishop, and in the mediation of the Durham coal strike of 1892.
