Milinda-panha, (Pali: “Questions of Milinda”)  lively dialogue on Buddhist doctrine with questions and dilemmas posed by King Milinda—i.e., Menander, Greek ruler of a large Indo-Greek empire in the late 2nd century bce—and answered by Nagasena, a senior monk. Composed in northern India in perhaps the 1st or 2nd century ce (and possibly originally in Sanskrit) by an unknown author, the Milinda-panha is the one noncanonical work whose authority was accepted implicitly by such commentators as Buddhaghosa, who quoted it frequently. It is also one of the few postcanonical works of the Theravada school that was not produced in Ceylon (modern Sri Lanka), though its authority there remains unquestioned.
The problems discussed are common themes in the Pali canon, beginning with the nonexistence of a soul, and the doctrine is Theravada. Of the seven books into which the work is divided, the second and third and sections of the first are masterpieces of ancient Indian prose. They deal with basic questions of interest to laypersons and make excellent use of parables. The remainder is a later addition of a more scholastic nature.
