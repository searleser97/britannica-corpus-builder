Vedantadeshika, also called Venkatanatha,  (born 1268, Tuppule, near Kanchipuram, Vijayanagar, India—died 1370, Srirangam), leading theologian of the Vishishtadvaita (Qualified Nondualist) school of philosophy and founder of the Vadakalai subsect of the Shrivaishnavas, a religious movement of South India.
Vedantadeshika was born into a distinguished Shrivaishnava family that followed the teachings of Ramanuja, an 11th–12th-century saint. A precocious child, Vedantadeshika was said to have been taken at age five to meet the sect’s leader, Vatsya Varadacharya, who blessed him, saying he would in time be a great teacher and repudiate all false philosophers. Vedantadeshika married and had a family but lived on alms in order to devote himself fully to his philosophic and literary efforts. He was a prolific writer in both Sanskrit and Tamil; his more than 100 works include commentaries on Vaishnava scriptures; Nyaya-parishuddhi, a comprehensive work on Vishishtadvaita logic; Yadavabhyudaya, a poetic work on the life of the deity Krishna; Sankalpa-suryodaya, an allegorical drama; and devotional hymns.
According to Vedantadeshika’s interpretation of prapatti (surrender to the grace of God), some effort is required on the part of the worshiper to secure God’s grace, just as the baby monkey must hold to its mother (the markata-nyaya, or the “analogy of the monkey”). This view—together with ritual and linguistic differences—became the basis for the split between the two subsects, the Vadakalai and the Tenkalai, who held that God’s grace is unconditioned and that the human soul is as unassertive as a kitten carried by its mother.
