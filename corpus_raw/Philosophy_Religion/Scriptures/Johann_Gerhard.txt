Johann Gerhard,  (born October 17, 1582, Quedlinburg, Halberstadt [Germany]—died August 17, 1637, Jena, Saxony [Germany]), leading German Protestant theologian, biblical scholar, renowned polemicist, author of the standard Lutheran dogmatic treatise Loci Theologici, and spearhead of every major Lutheran theological gathering of his time.
Gerhard was deeply influenced as a youth by the Lutheran theologian Johann Arndt and studied theology and philosophy at the Universities of Wittenberg, Marburg, and Jena. In 1606 he became superintendent of the churches in Heldburg in the duchy of Coburg, and he later supervised all the churches in the duchy. He joined the faculty of theology at Jena in 1616 and remained there until his death.
Gerhard’s strict interpretation of the Bible is evident in the theological system set forth in his nine-volume Loci Theologici (1610–22; “Theological Commonplaces”), the most significant dogmatic work of the era of Lutheran orthodoxy. Gerhard recognizing the Bible as the only guiding principle in religion, the Loci argues for the infallibility of the Bible against the infallibility of the pope. Designed deliberately to be both catholic and evangelical, Gerhard’s work represents the culmination of a tradition of Lutheran dogmatics that was begun with Philipp Melanchthon. Among Gerhard’s other writings are the four-volume Confessio Catholica (1634–37; “Catholic Confession”) and Meditationes Sacrae (1606; “Sacred Meditations”), a devotional manual.
