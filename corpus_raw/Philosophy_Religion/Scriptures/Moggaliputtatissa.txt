Moggaliputtatissa,  president of the third Buddhist council (c. 250 bce) and author of the Kathāvatthu (“Points of Controversy”). Included among the Pāli Abhidamma Piṭaka, the Kathāvatthu is a series of questions from a non-Theravāda point of view, with their implications refuted in the answers; the long first chapter debates the existence of a soul. Moggaliputtatissa is credited with ordaining Aśoka’s son Mahinda into the sangha (community of believers) and with bringing some organization to Buddhist missions sent to regions adjacent to India following the third council.  He is said to have died at the age of 80 in the 26th year of Aśoka’s reign.
