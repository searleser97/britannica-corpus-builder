John Woolman,  (born October 19, 1720, Ancocas, New Jersey [U.S.]—died  October 7, 1772, York, Yorkshire, England), British-American Quaker leader and abolitionist whose Journal is recognized as one of the classic records of the spiritual inner life.
Until he was 21 Woolman worked for his father, a Quaker farmer. He then moved to Mount Holly, New Jersey, to enter trade. At that time he made his first appearance as a preacher of Quaker doctrine, exercising his ministry without financial remuneration, in keeping with his religion’s practice. In 1743 he took up tailoring, which afforded a modest income, augmented at times by other work. From 1743 he made frequent and often arduous preaching journeys, visiting, among other places, Maryland’s east shore, where he carried his message against slaveholding, and the Rhode Island coast, where he brought his antislavery doctrine to the attention of shipowners. In Indian villages of the Pennsylvania frontier, he supported Moravian missionary attempts, sought to curtail the sale of rum to the Indians, and worked for a more just Indian land policy.
Woolman maintained a strict manner of life, making his trips on foot whenever possible, wearing undyed garments, and abstaining from the use of any product connected with the slave trade. He was successful in getting Quaker communities to go on record against slavery and in persuading many individuals to free their slaves.
Woolman’s Journal, published in 1774, was begun in his 36th year and continued until his death; it is a major document of his religious experience, written in a style distinguished by purity and simplicity of expression. He also wrote several other works expressing his spiritual and antislavery convictions. All his writings were collected in The Works of John Woolman (1774). The most complete edition of the Journal is that of A.M. Gummere (1922).
