Peshitta, (Syriac: “simple” or “common”)  Syriac version of the Bible, the accepted Bible of Syrian Christian churches from the end of the 3rd century ce. The name “Peshitta” was first employed by Moses bar Kepha in the 9th century to suggest (as does the name of the Latin Vulgate) that the text was in common use. The name also may have been employed in contradistinction to the more complex Syro-Hexaplar version.
Of the vernacular versions of the Bible, the Old Testament Peshitta is second only to the Greek Septuagint in antiquity, dating from probably the 1st and 2nd centuries ce. The earliest parts in Old Syriac are thought to have been translated from Hebrew or Aramaic texts by Jewish Christians at Edessa, although the Old Testament Peshitta was later revised according to Greek textual principles. The earliest extant versions of the New Testament Peshitta date to the 5th century ce and exclude the Second Letter of Peter, the Second and Third Letters of John, the Letter of Jude, and the Revelation to John, which were not canonical in the Syrian church.
