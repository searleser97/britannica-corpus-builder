Hai ben Sherira,   (born 939—died  March 23, 1038), last outstanding Babylonian gaon, or head, of a great Talmudic academy, remembered for the range and profundity of the exceptionally large number of responsa (authoritative answers to questions concerning interpretation of Jewish law) he wrote.
Though the office of gaon was not necessarily hereditary, Hai, whose family traced its origin back to the Davidic dynasty, was fourth in a direct line to occupy the gaonate of Pumbedita (Babylonia), situated in Baghdad from the late 9th century on. He assisted his father, Sherira ben Ḥanina, in teaching and later as chief of court of the academy. A false accusation to the caliph by Jewish adversaries caused them both to be imprisoned briefly (997). When they were freed, Hai’s father appointed him gaon (998).
Close to a thousand responsa written by Hai, equaling the number of extant responsa written by all other geonim, are extant. He couched them in the same languages (Hebrew, Aramaic, or Arabic) in which the questions were written. The extent of his fame is evident in questions that reached him from such faraway places as Ethiopia, Anatolia, and Spain. On occasion, when no Talmudic citation can be found, his answers employ non-Jewish authorities. Hai steered a middle course between rationalism and more esoteric doctrines, allowing the Kabbala, the influential body of Jewish mystical writings, validity insofar as its components are Talmudic but castigating it when it proposes miracle-making formulas by using the names of God. He died at the age of 99 on the eve of the last day of Passover, 1038. He was eulogized by the famous Judeo-Spanish poets Solomon ibn Gabirol and Samuel ha-Nagid as one who left no children but countless disciples in all countries of the world.
