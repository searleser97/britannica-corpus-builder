Zhuangzi, Wade-Giles romanization Chuang-tzu, also called Nanhua zhenjing (Chinese: “The Pure Classic of Nanhua”),  Chinese philosophical, literary, and religious classic bearing the name of the philosopher Zhuangzi (“Master Zhuang”), or Zhuang Zhou (flourished 4th century bce). It was highly influential in the development of subsequent Chinese philosophy and religion, particularly Daoism, Buddhism, and Song-dynasty neo-Confucianism. The first seven chapters of the text—the so-called “Inner Chapters” (neipian)—were probably authored by Zhuangzi himself. The remainder—subdivided into the “Outer Chapters” (waipian), chapters 8 through 22, and the so-called “Miscellaneous Chapters” (zapian), chapters 23 through 32—were likely elaborations by disciples, and the book was edited into its current form in the 4th century ce by Guo Xiang.
The text presents a process-oriented view of the cosmos, which is the product of the ceaseless fluctuations and transformations of the Dao (Way). The Dao perpetually generates and transforms the “ten thousand things”—of which the human race is one—that constitute the world. Through parables, poetic thought experiments (often from a first-person perspective), and stories of Zhuangzi’s dialogues and debates with the logician Hui Shi, the text presents a view of reality that is often mistaken as whimsically relativistic or fatalistic but can be better described as “antilogical.” The world (or “nature”; see tian), which is the external manifestation of the Dao, is spontaneous (ziran). Human beings, however, often inhibit this natural spontaneity with logic, language, and ritual. According to the text, cultivating emptiness (xu) and embracing spontaneity permits a “free and easy wandering” within the Dao and is a way of “nourishing life” and subverting the stultifying effects of culture.
