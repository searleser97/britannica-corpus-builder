Bundahishn,   (Pahlavi: Original Creation), Zoroastrian scripture giving an account of the creation, history, and duration of the world, the origin of man, and the nature of the universe. Written in Pahlavi, it dates from the 9th century ad but is based on ancient material from a lost part of the original Avesta and preserves some pre-Zoroastrian elements.
