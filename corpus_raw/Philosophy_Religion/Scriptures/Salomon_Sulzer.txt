Salomon Sulzer, original name Salomon Levi,  (born March 30, 1804, Hohenems, Austria—died January 17, 1890, Vienna), Austrian Jewish cantor, considered the most important composer of synagogue music in the 19th century.
Sulzer was trained in cantorial singing from childhood, studying in Austria and Switzerland and travelling in France. In 1820 he was appointed cantor at Hohenems and served there for five years, during which time he modernized the liturgy and introduced choral music to the service. Called to Vienna as chief cantor in 1825, he embarked on the major task of reforming and reorganizing the musical parts of the liturgy and publishing collections of newly harmonized traditional tunes, for which he earned the sobriquet “father of modern synagogue music” and the respect of such composers as Franz Liszt, Robert Schumann, and Franz Schubert. An important publication was Shir Ẕion (1840–66; “Song of Zion”), a comprehensive collection of music for the Sabbath, festivals, and holy days, for cantor, choir, and congregational responses with optional organ accompaniment. The musical style was a compromise between traditional chant (for the cantor) and Protestant-like settings for choir; the congregational responses were simple and not unlike Gregorian chant.
Sulzer also wrote secular pieces and, as a singer, was particularly noted for his performances of Schubert’s songs. He was highly honoured throughout Europe in his lifetime, and his influence was strongly felt in 20th-century synagogue music.
