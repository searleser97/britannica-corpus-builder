Ashvalayana,  (flourished 400 bce?), author of the Ashvalayana-shrauta-sutra, a Vedic manual of sacrificial ceremonies composed for the use of the class of priests called hotar, or hotri, whose main function was to invoke the gods. Belonging to the “forest tradition” of hermits and wandering holy men yet still a member of the Vedic priesthood, Ashvalayana is mentioned as a teacher as well as a sage in Vedic litanies. He is said to have been a student of the great grammarian Shaunaka.
