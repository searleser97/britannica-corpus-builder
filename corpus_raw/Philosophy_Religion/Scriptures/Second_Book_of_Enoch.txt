Second Book of Enoch, also called Slavonic Book of Enoch,  pseudepigraphal work whose only extant version is a Slavonic translation of the Greek original. The Slavonic edition is a Christian work, probably of the 7th century ad, but it rests upon an older Jewish work written sometime in the 1st century ad (but before the destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem in ad 70, because there are references to pilgrimages and cultic rituals connected with temple worship). In its apocalyptic and cosmological emphases, the book is similar to First Book of Enoch and may be dependent on it, although II Enoch is recognized as a separate part of the literary tradition surrounding the patriarch Enoch.
The first part of the book (chapters 1–21) deals with Enoch’s journey through the seven tiers of heaven; it thus invites comparisons with descriptions of the heavenly spheres and their inhabitants in the I Enoch and the “Testament of Levi” in Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs. The second section (chapters 22–38) is an explication of the tradition of Enoch’s reception of secret wisdom from God. The final section (chapters 39–68) includes Enoch’s advice to his sons and an account of his life, including his final ascension.
A product of the Greek-speaking Jewish Diaspora centred in Alexandria, Egypt, II Enoch includes many of the motifs characteristic of Hellenistic religious literature: visionary journeys, astrological calculations, a highly developed angelology, personal confrontations with divine beings, and a structural view of heaven.
