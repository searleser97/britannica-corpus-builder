Lalitavistara, (Sanskrit: “Detailed Narration of the Sport [of the Buddha]”)  legendary life of the Gautama Buddha, written in a combination of Sanskrit and a vernacular. The text apparently is a recasting, in the Mahayana (“Greater Vehicle”) tradition, of a work from the Sarvastivada school. Like the Mahavastu (“Great Story”), the subject matter of which is the same, the Lalitavistara contains late material but also preserves some very ancient passages. It shares with the Hindu Puranas (encyclopaedic collections of legends and other lore) similarities of style as well as the concept of a divine being’s earthly activities as “sport,” or “play.” In characteristic Mahayana fashion, an introductory chapter describes the Buddha, deep in meditation and surrounded by a divine effulgence, about to reveal the contents of the text to an assemblage of 12,000 monks and some 32,000 bodhisattvas (“those destined to become enlightened”). In the ensuing narrative it is especially with regard to the Buddha’s conception and birth that this work adds to the miraculous and mythological elements of earlier accounts.
The Lalitavistara has inspired a considerable amount of Buddhist art. A version of it appears to have been translated into Chinese in 308 ce.
