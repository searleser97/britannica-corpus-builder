Gurdās, Bhāī, in full Bhāī Gurdās Bhallā,  (born c. 1550—died 1637), , most famous of all Sikh poets and theologians apart from the 10 Gurūs (the founders and early leaders of the Sikh community). Bhāī is an honorific title meaning “brother.”
Bhāī Gurdās’ fame rests on being the scribe of the Kartārpur Pothī, the manuscript of Sikh scripture prepared during the time of Gurū Arjan. Gurdās also composed original works of poetry that are highly regarded within Sikhism. His compositions include 40 (some scholars say 39) vārs (ballads) in Punjabi and 556 kabitts (short poems) in Braj Bhāṣā (a western dialect of Hindi). The vārs enjoy semicanonical status and are among the only compositions outside the sacred scriptures that Sikhs are allowed to recite and sing within the confines of the gurdwārās, or houses of worship. They also are a significant resource for understanding the early Sikh community.
