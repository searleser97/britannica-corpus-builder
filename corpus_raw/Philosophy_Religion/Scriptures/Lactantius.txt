Lactantius, in full Lucius Caecilius Firmianus Lactantius, Caecilius also spelled Caelius,  (born ad 240, North Africa—died c. 320, Augusta Treverorum, Belgica [now Trier, Ger.]), Christian apologist and one of the most reprinted of the Latin Church Fathers, whose Divinae institutiones (“Divine Precepts”), a classically styled philosophical refutation of early-4th-century anti-Christian tracts, was the first systematic Latin account of the Christian attitude toward life. Lactantius was referred to as the “Christian Cicero” by Renaissance humanists.
Lactantius was appointed a teacher of rhetoric at Nicomedia (later İzmit, Tur.) by the Roman emperor Diocletian. When the emperor began persecuting Christians, however, Lactantius resigned his post about 305 and returned to the West. Later, in about 317, he came out of retirement to tutor the emperor Constantine’s son Crispus, at Trier.
Only Lactantius’ writings dealing with Christianity have survived. His principal work, the Divinae institutiones, depended more on the testimony of classical authors than on that of sacred Scripture. It repudiated what he termed the deluding superstitions of pagan cults, proposing in their place the Christian religion as a theism, or rationalized belief in a single Supreme Being who is the source creating all else. In a companion work, “On the Death of Persecutors,” Lactantius held that the Christian God—in contradistinction to the remote, unconcerned God of Stoic deism—could intervene to right human injustice. Moreover, he maintained that Roman justice could be better perfected by rooting it in the Christian doctrine of divine fatherhood uniting the human race in universal fraternity through the mediation of Christ than by basing it on the Latin concept of aequitas (“equity”).
Limited by an unprofound view of religion as popular morality, Lactantius was more adept in showing the incongruity of heathen polytheism than in establishing Christian teaching.
