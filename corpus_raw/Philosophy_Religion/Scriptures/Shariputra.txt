Shariputra, Pali Sariputta, given name Upatissa,  Brahman ascetic and famous early disciple of the Buddha. Shariputra first heard of the Buddha and his new teaching from Assaji, one of the original 60 disciples. Quickly achieving enlightenment, he developed a reputation as a master of the Abhidhamma (scholastic writings about the nature of reality). His disciples included Ananda, the Buddha’s personal attendant; Rahula, the Buddha’s son; and Moggallana. The Niddesa (“Exposition”) is attributed to him; its two parts give a philological exegesis of the last two (fourth and fifth) sections of the Suttanipata. He is said to have died shortly before the Buddha, and his relics were taken to Savatthi.
