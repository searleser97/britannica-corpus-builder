Acts of John,  an apocryphal (noncanonical and unauthentic) Christian writing, composed about ad 180, purporting to be an account of the travels and miracles of St. John the Evangelist. Photius, the 9th-century patriarch of Constantinople, identified the author of the Acts of John as Leucius Charinus, otherwise unknown. The book reflects the heretical views of early Christian Docetists, who denied the reality of Christ’s physical body and attributed to it only the appearance of materiality. The Acts of John likewise has a hymn containing formulas to evade demons who, according to Gnostic teachings, could impede one’s journey to heaven. The book was condemned by the second Council of Nicaea, in ad 787, because of its subversion of orthodox Christian teachings.
