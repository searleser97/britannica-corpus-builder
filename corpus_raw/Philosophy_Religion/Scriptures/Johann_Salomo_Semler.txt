Johann Salomo Semler,  (born Dec. 18, 1725, Saalfeld, duchy of Saxe-Saalfeld [Germany]—died March 14, 1791, Halle, Brandenburg), German Lutheran theologian who was a major figure in the development of biblical textual criticism during his tenure (1753–91) as professor of theology at the University of Halle.
Semler was a disciple of the rationalist Siegmund Jakob Baumgarten, whom he succeeded on his death in 1757 as head of the theological faculty. Seeking to study biblical texts scientifically, Semler evolved an undogmatic and strictly historical interpretation of Scripture that provoked strong opposition. He was the first to deny, and to offer substantial evidence supporting his denial, that the entirety of the text of Old and New Testaments was divinely inspired and fully correct. He challenged the divine authority of the biblical canon, which he reexamined in order to determine the sequence of composition of biblical books, their nature, and their manner of transmission. From this work he drew a crucial distinction between an earlier, Jewish form of Christianity and a later, broader form.
Despite his rationalist approach, however, Semler maintained that faith was a prerequisite for understanding religious matters, and he upheld this view in his rebuttal of 1779 to “Wolfenbüttel Fragments” by Hermann Samuel Reimarus. Semler’s method of textual criticism, which prepared the way for more extensive work during the 19th century, also made him aware of the diversity of answers to religious questions in the past and of the need to recognize varied theologies as avenues to the same truth. Among his works are several biblical commentaries and an edition of the works of the 2nd–3rd-century Christian theologian Tertullian.
