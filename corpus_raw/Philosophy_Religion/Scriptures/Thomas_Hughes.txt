Thomas Hughes,  (born Oct. 20, 1822, Uffington, Berkshire, Eng.—died  March 22, 1896, Brighton, Sussex), British jurist, reformer, and novelist best known for Tom Brown’s School Days.
Hughes attended Rugby School from 1834 to 1842. His love for the great Rugby headmaster Thomas Arnold and for games and boyish high spirits are admirably captured in the novel Tom Brown’s School Days (1857). The book’s success—it ran into nearly 50 editions by 1890—helped create an enduring image of the public-school product and popularize the doctrine of “muscular Christianity.”
From 1842 to 1845 Hughes had attended Oriel College, Oxford, and Tom Brown at Oxford (1861), a less-successful sequel, gives a picture of life there at that time. He then studied law and was called to the bar in 1848. His admiration for the religious reformer Frederick Denison Maurice led him to join the Christian Socialists and, in 1854, to become a founder member of the Working Men’s College, of which he was principal from 1872 to 1883. His simple, earnest approach to religion and his robust patriotism show plainly in his tracts A Layman’s Faith (1868) and The Manliness of Christ (1879). A Liberal member of Parliament from 1865 to 1874, he became queen’s counsel in 1869 and a county court judge in 1882. In 1870 he visited the United States, and in 1879 he made an unsuccessful and financially draining attempt to found a cooperative settlement in Rugby, Tenn.
