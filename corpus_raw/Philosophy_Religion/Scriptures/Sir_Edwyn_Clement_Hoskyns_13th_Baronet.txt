Sir Edwyn Clement Hoskyns, 13th Baronet,  (born Aug. 9, 1884, London, Eng.—died  June 28, 1937, London), Anglican biblical scholar and theologian.
Educated at Jesus College, Cambridge, and Wells Theological College, Hoskyns was ordained in 1908. He was associated with Corpus Christi College from 1919 to 1932 and was canon theologian of Liverpool Cathedral from 1932 to 1935. He succeeded to his father’s baronetcy in 1925.
Having applied modern linguistic criticism to New Testament literature (especially in his posthumous work The Fourth Gospel, 2 vol. [1940]), he emphasized the complexity of religious mystery in interpreting Christ and the origins of Christianity, as opposed to the naturalism characterizing “the historical Jesus” of liberal Protestantism.
