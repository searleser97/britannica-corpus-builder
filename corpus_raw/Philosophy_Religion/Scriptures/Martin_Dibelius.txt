Martin Dibelius,  (born Sept. 14, 1883, Dresden, Ger.—died  Nov. 11, 1947, Heidelberg, W.Ger.), German biblical scholar and pioneer of New Testament form criticism (the analysis of the Bible’s literary forms).
Dibelius was educated at several German universities and taught from 1910 to 1915 at the University of Berlin before becoming professor of New Testament exegesis and criticism at Heidelberg, a post he held until his death. His major work, Die Formgeschichte des Evangeliums (1919; “Form Criticism of the Gospels”; Eng. trans., From Tradition to Gospel), presented an analysis of the Gospels in terms of oral traditions. The earliest form of the Gospels, he proposed, consisted of short sermons; the needs of the Christian community determined the development of written Gospels from these early preachings. His analysis of the Acts of the Apostles showed that the Gospel-writer Luke had access to written records of St. Paul and may have been Paul’s companion.
Throughout his writings, Dibelius pursued the origins of ethical statements found in the New Testament and other early Christian writings. His approach was well-received in Germany, and all of his major works were translated into English.
