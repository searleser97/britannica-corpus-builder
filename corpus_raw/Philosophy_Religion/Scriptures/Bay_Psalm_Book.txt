Bay Psalm Book, byname of The Whole Booke of Psalmes Faithfully Translated into English Metre,  (1640), perhaps the oldest book now in existence that was published in British North America. It was prepared by Puritan leaders of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Printed in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on a press set up by Stephen Day, it included a dissertation on the lawfulness and necessity of singing psalms in church.
