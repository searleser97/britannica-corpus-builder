Gandavyūha Sūtra,  Mahāyāna Buddhist sūtra that forms the climax of a larger text, the Avataṃsaka Sūtra. The Avataṃsaka Sūtra was most likely composed in Sanskrit in the 4th century and was first translated into Chinese by the monk Bodhibhadra in the second decade of the 5th century. The Avataṃsaka describes the universe as it is seen and experienced by enlightened buddhas and bodhisattvas, as well as the various stages of a bodhisattva’s progression on the path to enlightenment. In addition to its important position within the Avataṃsaka, scenes from the Gandavyūha, along with ones from other Buddhist texts such as the Divyāvadāna and Lalitavistara, can be found among the bas reliefs of the great Buddhist monument in Java, Borobudur.
In the Gandavyūha, a young pilgrim named Sudhana commences a search for supreme enlightenment that takes him on a journey to see more than fifty teachers—people from all walks of life—and even leads him to an intimate, but nonetheless enlightening, encounter with a prostitute named Vasumitrā, who is also a wise bodhisattva. Sudhana experiences a magnificent cosmological vision, the perspective of enlightened buddhas known as dharmadhātu. Finally, Sudhana attains a vision of the bodhisattva Samantabhadra and realizes that his own nature, and those of Samantabhadra, all buddhas, and all other existences in the cosmos are, in fact, one and infinitely interpenetrate one another.
