Frederick William Robertson, byname Robertson Of Brighton,  (born Feb. 3, 1816, London—died  Aug. 15, 1853, Brighton, Sussex, Eng.), Anglican clergyman who became widely popular particularly among the working class because of the oratory and psychological insight in his sermons preached from 1847 at Trinity Chapel, Brighton. Appealing to a broad religious consensus within Anglican belief by avoiding theological concepts, he advocated the reform ideas of the 1848 Revolution, but his views generated strong opposition. His Sermons, published posthumously (1855–74), deeply influenced Anglican devotion.
