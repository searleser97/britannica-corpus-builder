Abhisamayalambkaraloka, (Sanskrit: “Illumination of the Abhisamayalambkara”)  important contribution to exegetical literature on the Prajnaparamita- (“Perfection of Wisdom”) sutras of the Mahayana Buddhist tradition and one of the texts most often studied in Tibetan monasteries.
The Prajnaparamita-sutras, with their emphasis on the doctrine of ontological “emptiness” and the attainment of nirvana through perfect wisdom, had been systematized in a terse commentary known as the Abhisamayalambkara. (Abhisamaya means either “insight” or “uniting” and designates Buddhist training toward enlightenment; alambkara is a literary form in verse.) This latter text required its own commentaries, which continued to be produced in Tibet into modern times. It was paraphrased in the present treatise, the Abhisamayalambkaraloka, which also offered a detailed commentary on the Ashtasahasrika (“8,000-Verse”) Prajnaparamita.
The author was Haribhadra. He wrote around ad 750, and his text was translated from Sanskrit into Tibetan in the 10th or 11th century.
