Liji, (Chinese: “Record of Rites”) Wade-Giles romanization Li-chi,  one of the Five Classics (Wujing) of Chinese Confucian literature, the original text of which is said to have been compiled by the ancient sage Confucius (551–479 bc). During the 1st century bc the text was extensively reworked by Dai De (Elder Dai) and his cousin Dai Sheng (Younger Dai). Scholars presume that the original title, Lijing (“Classic of Rites”), was dropped so that jing (“classic”) would be reserved for works more directly connected with Confucius.
In general, Liji underscores moral principles in its treatment of such subjects as royal regulations, development of rites, ritual objects and sacrifices, education, music, the behaviour of scholars, and the doctrine of the mean (zhongyong). In 1190 Zhu Xi, a Neo-Confucian philosopher, gave two chapters of Liji separate titles and published them together with two other Confucian texts under the name Sishu (“Four Books”). This collection is generally used to introduce Chinese students to Confucian literature.
