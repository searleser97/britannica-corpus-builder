Letters of Paul to the Thessalonians, also called Epistles of St. Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians, abbreviation Thessalonians,  two New Testament letters written by St. Paul the Apostle from Corinth, Achaea (now in southern Greece), about 50 ce and addressed to the Christian community he had founded in Thessalonica (now in northern Greece). The First Letter of Paul to the Thessalonians and the Second Letter of Paul to the Thessalonians are the 13th and 14th books of the New Testament canon.
In all probability, 1 Thessalonians is the earliest of Paul’s epistles, particularly because it indicates that the memory of the events leading to the founding of that congregation are still fresh in the mind of the apostle. The letter was written from Corinth after his coworker St. Timothy returned from Thessalonica to report that the new converts had stood fast in the Lord despite persecution.
Apparently to refute slanderous charges that he used guile and flattery to gain converts, Paul points out that the Thessalonians themselves were eyewitnesses to his “pure, upright, and blameless” behaviour (2:10). He likewise calls attention to the fact that he worked night and day so as not to burden anyone. In answer to a question that disturbed the community, Paul explains that everyone, both the living and the dead, will share in Christ’s Resurrection at the time of his Second Coming.
The second letter was written shortly after the first, but some question Pauline authorship because there is notable ambiguity about the proximity of Christ’s Second Coming. Christians apparently believed that it was useless to work, because the end of the world was close at hand. The letter thus explains that the final day will not arrive until after the Antichrist appears and proclaims himself God. Christians must consequently continue “to earn their own living” (3:12), as did Paul himself in Thessalonica, who “did not eat anyone’s bread without paying for it” (3:8).
