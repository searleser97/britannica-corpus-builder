Adolf Jellinek,  (born June 26, 1821, Drslavice, Moravia, Austrian Empire [now in Czech Republic]—died  Dec. 29, 1893, Vienna, Austria), rabbi and scholar who was considered to be the most forceful Jewish preacher of his time in central Europe.
From 1845 to 1856 Jellinek preached in Leipzig and from 1856 to 1893 in Vienna. Because of his skillful incorporation into his sermons of those Midrashim (rabbinic commentaries on the Scriptures) that deal with Jewish lore, Jellinek was also an unusually appealing speaker. More than 200 of his sermons were published at various times (three volumes, 1862–66, and nine smaller collections, 1847–82), and these works measurably affected the development of the art of Jewish preaching.
Jellinek’s scholarly activities chiefly comprised studies of the Kabbala (the highly influential body of Jewish mystical writings) and Midrashic literature. He was a prominent exponent of Wissenschaft des Judentums (“science of Judaism”), the analysis of Jewish literature and culture with the tools of modern scholarly research. He was the first to compare the Sefer ha-Zohar, the fundamental text of the Kabbalists, with the Hebrew texts of the 13th-century mystic Moses de León. Based on his deduction that Moses de León was the principal author of the Zohar, Jellinek also postulated that the Zohar was an attempt by Moses de León to counteract the rationalist trend among his educated contemporaries. In the Midrashic field, he edited hitherto unpublished treatises on ancient and medieval homilies and documents of messianic and apocalyptic thinking, such as Bet ha-Midrash (1853–77; “The House of Study”).
