Jean Pucelle,  (flourished c. 1319–34), an outstanding miniature painter and manuscript illuminator. He excelled in the invention of drolleries (marginal designs) and in traditional iconography.
There is little information concerning Pucelle’s background. In the 1300s he apparently made a trip to Italy that resulted in Florentine and Sienese features in his work, though the basis remained essentially Gothic and French. Pucelle returned to France, where he was master of an illuminator’s workshop, which dominated Parisian painting during the first half of the 14th century. During this time he apparently also enjoyed court patronage.
Pucelle’s most-celebrated works are his illuminations in the Belleville Breviary, which reflect Duccio’s Maestà (c. 1325), and in the Hours of Jeanne d’Evreux (c. 1325–28), a private prayer book. The latter was done as a royal commission to Jeanne d’Evreux, the queen of France. This work is a reflection of the artist’s synthesis of sources that influenced his style. Pucelle makes excellent use of the drolleries to give a playful tone to what is essentially a religious work.
