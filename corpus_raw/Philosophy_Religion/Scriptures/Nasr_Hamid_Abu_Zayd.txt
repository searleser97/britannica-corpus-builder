Naṣr Ḥāmid Abū Zayd,  (born Oct. 7, 1943, Ṭanṭā, Egypt—died July 5, 2010, Cairo), Egyptian scholar whose interpretations of the Qurʾān challenged mainstream views and sparked controversy and debate.
Abū Zayd attended Cairo University and received a Ph.D. in Arab and Islamic studies. His research and writings on Qurʾānic exegesis, including his well-known Critique of Islamic Discourse (1995), offended some Islamic fundamentalists. In 1993 a colleague denounced him in a major Cairo mosque, and Islamic radicals successfully sought a nullification of his marriage from an Egyptian family court on the grounds that his writings demonstrated his apostasy (and under Egyptian law a Muslim woman may not be married to a non-Muslim man). Though the court declined to pass judgment, an appeals court divorced Abū Zayd and his wife, a decision confirmed by the Egyptian Supreme Court. The case attracted widespread concern among intellectuals and human rights groups. In 1995 Abū Zayd and his wife went into exile, eventually settling in the Netherlands, where he taught. In later years he occasionally visited Egypt.
