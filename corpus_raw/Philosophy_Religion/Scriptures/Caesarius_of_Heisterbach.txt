Caesarius Of Heisterbach,   (born c. 1170, Cologne [Germany]—died c. 1240, Heisterbach, Lower Lorraine [now in Germany]), preacher whose ecclesiastical histories and ascetical writings made him one of the most popular authors of 13th-century Germany.
Caesarius was educated at the school of St. Andrew, Cologne, and joined the Cistercian Order in 1199, becoming prior of the Heisterbach house in 1228. His Dialogus miraculorum (c. 1223; “Dialogue on Miracles”), which contains edifying narratives dealing with Cistercian life, was his most widely read work and has become an important source for the history of 13th-century Germany. He also composed eight books on miracles (edited 1901), a life of St. Elizabeth of Hungary (edited 1908), and a biographical list of the archbishops of Cologne from 94 to 1238 (in Monumenta Germaniae Historica, vol. 24). His life of St. Engelbert (edited 1663) is generally considered his principal historical work. Caesarius was noted for his practical sermons and for his opposition to the rationalistic tendency of scholastic philosophy.
