Jeremy Taylor,  (baptized Aug. 15, 1613, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, Eng.—died Aug. 13, 1667, Lisburn, County Antrim, Ire.), Anglican clergyman and writer.
Taylor was educated at the University of Cambridge and was ordained in 1633. He never lacked for patrons: Archbishop Laud granted him a fellowship to All Souls College, Oxford, in 1635; William Juxon, bishop of London, presented him the living of Uppingham in 1638; and Charles I, whom he had joined at Oxford in the Civil War by 1642, made him doctor of divinity by royal decree in 1643. After his capture in Wales in 1645, Taylor set up a school with the grammarian William Nicholson in Carmarthenshire.
By 1655 he had written his enduring works: The Rule and Exercises of Holy Living (1650) and The Rule and Exercises of Holy Dying (1651). These devotional handbooks were written to help members of the Church of England who were deprived of a regular ministry during the disturbances of the Commonwealth. The books’ beauty and spiritual insight made them popular with all denominations, however, and their influence extended to the 18th-century Methodist John Wesley.
A spiritual counselor to the diarist John Evelyn, Taylor was helped by him with gifts of money. He ministered to scattered congregations of Anglican royalists, and in 1658 became a chaplain of Edward, 3rd Viscount Conway, in Ulster. Made bishop of Down and Connor after the Restoration in 1660, he also served on the Irish privy council and helped reconstitute the University of Dublin. He repulsed Scottish efforts to fill Ulster livings with anti-episcopal ministers.
