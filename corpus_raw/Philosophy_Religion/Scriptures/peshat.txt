Peshaṭ,   (Hebrew: “spread out”), in Jewish hermeneutics, the simple, obvious, literal meaning of a biblical text. In the interpretation of the Halakha (the “Proper Way”; i.e., the Oral Law that was essentially an interpretation of the Written Law), peshaṭ was preferred. Other interpretive principles, however, could be used simultaneously in any given text: remez (meaning “hint,” in reference to typological or allegorical interpretations), derash (meaning “search,” in reference to biblical study according to the middot, or rules), and sod (meaning “secret,” or mystical interpretation). The first letters (PRDS) of these four words were first used in medieval Spain as an acronym forming the word PaRaDiSe to designate a theory of four basic interpretive principles: literal, philosophical, inferred, and mystical.
Depending on the needs or preferences of a particular historical period, one of the four principles generally gained a dominant position. During the early scribal and rabbinical period (c. 4th century bc–c. 2nd century ad), peshaṭ was preferred. Later, in the Talmudic period (c. 3rd–6th century ad), the inferred sense (derash) was viewed as more adequately communicating the intent of the divine author of the text—i.e., making the text more relevant by seeking in it ethical and religious implications. Both remez and sod, which allowed for greater speculation, became favourite interpretive methods of the Kabbalists, Jewish mystics who flourished in Europe and Palestine during the Middle Ages and the early modern period.
