Giulio Aleni,  (born 1582, Brescia, republic of Venice [Italy]—died  Aug. 3, 1649, Fu-chow, China), Jesuit priest who was the first Christian missionary in the province of Kiangsi, China.
Aleni entered the Society of Jesus in 1600 and was sent to the Far East. He landed at Macau in 1610 and went to China three years later. During his more than 30 years in China, he adopted that country’s dress and manners. He built several churches in the province of Fukien and wrote the Life of Christ, 8 vol. (1635–37). Often reprinted, it was used by Protestant missionaries. He also wrote a six-volume cosmography that was translated into Manchu.
