The Prayer of Azariah,  apocryphal insertion into The Book of Daniel in the Greek (Septuagint) Bible and subsequently included in the Latin (Vulgate) Bible and the Roman Catholic biblical canon.
The Prayer of Azariah and the accompanying Song of the Three Young Men form part of chapter three and embellish the story of Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, three young Jewish men who were bound and thrown into a fiery furnace for defying Nebuchadrezzar’s order to worship an idol. The Prayer of Azariah is said by Azariah alone. It is a song of lamentation following a liturgical style popular after the 4th century bc: an introductory section of praise to God, a confession of Israel’s sin, a plea for mercy, and a doxology. The Song of the Three Young Men is a hymn of thanksgiving said by all three of the men after God has saved them from the fiery furnace. The song’s arrangement is similar to the repetitive refrains in Psalm 136. It takes its liturgical theme from Psalm 148.
