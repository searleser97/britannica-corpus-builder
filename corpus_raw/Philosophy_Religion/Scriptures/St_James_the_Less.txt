St. James the Less, also called James, son of Alphaeus, or James the Younger,  (flourished 1st century ce; Western feast day May 3; Eastern feast day October 9), one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus.
James may be he whose mother, Mary (not the mother of Jesus), is mentioned among the women at Jesus’ crucifixion and tomb (Mark 15:40, 16:1; Matthew 27:56). He is not to be confused with the apostle St. James the Greater, son of Zebedee, or St. James, the Lord’s brother, who was not one of the Twelve. Depending upon the Bible consulted, he is probably the father (Revised Standard and New English) or brother (Authorized and Douay) of the apostle St. Jude (Judas, not Iscariot). Nothing further is known of him, and a late legend of his martyrdom in Persia is spurious.
In the Western church, his identity with St. James, the Lord’s brother, was originally assumed in the feast of Saints Philip and James on May 1, the date of the dedication of the Church of the Holy Apostles in Rome, where supposed relics of these saints were brought about 560.
