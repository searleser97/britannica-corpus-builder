Miles Coverdale,  (born 1488?, York, Yorkshire [now in North Yorkshire], Eng.—died  Jan. 20, 1569, London), bishop of Exeter, Eng., who translated (rather freely; he was inexpert in Latin and Greek) the first printed English Bible.
Ordained a priest (1514) at Norwich, Coverdale became an Augustinian friar at Cambridge, where, influenced by his prior, Robert Barnes, he absorbed Lutheran opinions and later busied himself in biblical studies. In 1528, as a secular priest in Essex, he began preaching against images and the mass. In 1529 he helped William Tyndale (q.v.) translate the Pentateuch in Hamburg and then apparently settled in Antwerp, where he translated the Bible. He later returned to England and took up the Reform cause, translating tracts and editing the Great Bible (1539). In 1540 Henry VIII’s religious policies forced him to flee, and he settled in Strasbourg. After Henry’s death he returned to England, supported the new Protestant religious line, and was made bishop of Exeter (1551). Under the Roman Catholic Mary, Coverdale lost his bishopric and was spared burning by intercession from Denmark, where he then briefly went. During 1555–57 he was in Bergzabern near Strasbourg and thereafter until 1559 was in Switzerland. In 1559 he returned to England and helped consecrate Queen Elizabeth’s archbishop, Matthew Parker. Yet his Puritanism, strengthened by stays abroad, prevented him from resuming his bishopric of Exeter. He declined all preferments save a brief one (1564–66) at St. Magnus, Old London Bridge, but he often preached sermons that were highly esteemed.
