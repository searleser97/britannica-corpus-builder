Acts of Paul,  one of the earliest of a series of pseudepigraphal (noncanonical) New Testament writings known collectively as the Apocryphal Acts. Probably written about ad 160–180, the Acts of Paul is an account of the Apostle Paul’s travels and teachings. It includes, among others, an episode reminiscent of the Greek fable of Androcles and the lion, in which Paul escapes from the wild beasts in the arena at Ephesus by recognizing a lion he had baptized earlier.
The Acts of Paul was first mentioned by Tertullian (ad 160–230), who found the book heretical because it encouraged women to preach and baptize. Tertullian related that the book had been written by a presbyter of a church in Asia who claimed to have written “out of love of Paul,” and who was expelled from his church office. Despite the seemingly anti-Pauline endorsement of female ministry, the author did conform to doctrinal orthodoxy regarding continence and the Resurrection by establishing a close relationship between sexual purity and salvation. The author opposed the moral laxity of heretical Gnostic sects and attacked their denial of Christ’s Incarnation and Resurrection.
Little was known of the actual contents of the Acts of Paul until the publication in 1904 of a 6th-century Coptic manuscript indicating that the complete apocryphon comprised three different texts: the Acts of Paul and Thecla; a letter from the Corinthians to Paul and his reply, commonly styled III Corinthians; and the Martyrdom of Paul. Each of these had previously been discovered as a separate writing in a number of manuscripts and in a variety of publications. The subsequent publication in 1936 of a substantial Greek fragment corroborated the theory that these texts share a common authorship and originally constituted a single work, the Acts of Paul.
