Letter of Paul to the Colossians, also called Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Colossians, abbreviation Colossians,  twelfth book of the New Testament, addressed to Christians at Colossae, Asia Minor, whose congregation was founded by St. Paul the Apostle’s colleague Epaphras. The developed theology of the letter, many believe, indicates that it was either composed by Paul in Rome about 62 ce, rather than during an earlier imprisonment, or by one of his disciples. Some question Pauline authorship on the basis of vocabulary, style, and imagery and for its affinities with the Letter of Paul to Philemon; it is commonly considered to be one of the “deutero-Pauline” (in the tradition of Paul but not written by him) epistles.
The Colossians were apparently adopting proto-Gnostic and syncretistic views and practices that were incompatible with “the knowledge of God’s mystery, that is, Christ himself, in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge” (2:2–3). Though there are references to such things as philosophy and empty deceit (2:8), Jewish-like practices (2:16), visions (2:18), and “self-imposed piety, humility, and severe treatment of the body” (2:23), the source of these teachings is not quite clear. The author strives to curb such tendencies by recalling the preeminence of Christ in everything (1:18), because Christ is “the image of the invisible God” (1:15), who reconciled humanity to God “by the blood of his cross” (1:20). The author then exhorts the Christian community to put away anger, malice, and foul talk and to show kindness, meekness, patience, forgiveness, and love in imitation of Christ. Every Christian, according to their state in life, should fulfill their duties.
