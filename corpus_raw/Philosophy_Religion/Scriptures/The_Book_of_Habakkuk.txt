The Book of Habakkuk, also called The Prophecy Of Habacuc,  the eighth of 12 Old Testament books that bear the names of the Minor Prophets. The book betrays the influence of liturgical forms, suggesting that either Habakkuk was a cult prophet or that those responsible for the final form of the book were cult personnel.
It is difficult to fix the date of the book, but the mention of the Chaldeans as Yahweh’s agent (1:6) suggests the period of Chaldean power following their successful revolt against the Assyrians in 626 bc. A more precise date depends on the identity of “the wicked” and “the righteous” who are mentioned in the book. If “the wicked” are the Assyrians and “the righteous” are the Judaeans, then the book must be dated before 612 bc, when the Assyrian Empire finally fell.
According to this interpretation, Habakkuk announced the eventual collapse of the wicked oppressors (Assyrians) of the people of Judah. In the meantime, he consoled, “the righteous shall live by his faith” (2:4).
Chapter 3, a psalm complete with musical directions, does not appear in the Habakkuk commentary from Qumrān, but there is as yet no convincing reason to deny its authenticity.
