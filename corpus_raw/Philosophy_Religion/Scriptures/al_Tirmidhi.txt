Al-Tirmidhī, in full Abū ʿĪsā Muḥammad ibn ʿĪsā ibn Sawrah ibn Shaddād al-Tirmidhī,  (died c. 892), Arab scholar and author of one of the six canonical collections of spoken traditions (Hadith) attributed to the Prophet Muhammad.
The life of al-Tirmidhī is poorly documented. He journeyed to Khorāsān, to Iraq, and to the Hejaz in search of material for his collection and studied with such renowned scholars of Hadith as Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal, al-Bukhārī, and Abū Dāʿūd al-Sijistānī.
His canonical collection Al-Jāmiʿ al-ṣaḥīḥ (“The Sound Collections”) includes every spoken tradition that had ever been used to support a legal decision, as well as material relating to theological questions, to religious practice, and to popular belief and custom. Of special interest in this work are the author’s critical remarks on the links in the chains of transmission (isnāds).
In the Kitāb al-shamāʾil (“Book of Good Qualities”), al-Tirmidhī presented those hadiths specifically commenting on the character and life of Muhammad.
