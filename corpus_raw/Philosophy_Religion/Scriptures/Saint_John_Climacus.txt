Saint John Climacus,  (born c. 579—died c. 649, Mount Sinai, Sinai Peninsula; feast day March 30), Byzantine monk and author of Climax tou paradeisou (The Ladder of Divine Ascent, the source of his name “John of the Ladder”), a handbook on the ascetical and mystical life that has become a Christian spiritual classic. He is considered one of the greatest writers of the Hesychast tradition, an ascetical method of prayer that integrates repetitive prayer formulas with bodily postures and controlled breathing.
After entering the monastery of St. Catherine on Mount Sinai c. 600, John withdrew to live as a hermit in a nearby cell. He was chosen abbot c. 639 and ruled until shortly before he died; the book was written during this period.
John’s Ladder symbolizes the Old Testament patriarch Jacob’s dream of a climb to heaven. The work is divided into 30 chapters, representing the 30 years of the life of Jesus before he began his public ministry, which describe the steps in the spiritual struggle to moral perfection. It culminates on the highest rung in passive contemplation and the mystical ecstasy of divine union.
Although influenced by earlier Egyptian and other Eastern monastic writers, John exhibits psychological insights with a distinctive, terse style. Translation of The Ladder into almost all classical and modern languages attests to its perennial popularity, having affected especially the Hesychast (mystical and quietistic prayer method) movement among Greek Orthodox and Russian contemplatives. The Ladder is read in its entirety in Orthodox monasteries during Lent.
