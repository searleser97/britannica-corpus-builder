Jacobus De Voragine, also called Jacob Of Voragine,  (born 1228/30, Varazze, near Genoa [Italy]—died  July 13/14, 1298, Genoa), archbishop of Genoa, chronicler, and author of the Golden Legend.
Jacobus became a Dominican in 1244. After gaining a reputation throughout northern Italy as a preacher and theologian, he was provincial of Lombardy (1267–78 and 1281–86) and archbishop of the independent city of Genoa (1292) until his death. He was beatified in 1816 for his work as a peacemaker between Guelphs (pro-papal party) and Ghibellines (pro-imperial), and his feast day in the Dominican order is July 13.
His works include sermons on Gospel readings, saints’ days, and the Virgin Mary; a chronicle of Genoa; and the Legenda aurea (Golden Legend, also known as the Lombardica historia). This book is a collection of saints’ lives, of accounts of events in the lives of Christ and of the Virgin Mary, and of information about holy days and seasons, the whole arranged as readings (Latin: legenda) for the church year. Immensely popular in the Middle Ages, it was translated into all western European languages and gradually much enlarged. William Caxton’s translation was one of the first books printed in English (1483). Medieval artists found the Golden Legend a storehouse of events and persons to be illustrated. But the miraculous stories it contains and its natural lack of historical perspective rendered the book unacceptable at the Reformation and after the rise of the new learning, so it then went completely out of fashion.
