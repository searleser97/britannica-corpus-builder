Joshua, also spelled Josue, Hebrew Yehoshua (“Yahweh is deliverance”),  the leader of the Israelite tribes after the death of Moses, who conquered Canaan and distributed its lands to the 12 tribes. His story is told in the Old Testament Book of Joshua.
According to the biblical book named after him, Joshua was the personally appointed successor to Moses (Deuteronomy 31:1–8; 34:9) and a charismatic warrior who led Israel in the conquest of Canaan after the Exodus from Egypt. After sending spies into Canaan to report on the enemy’s morale, Joshua led the Israelites in an invasion across the Jordan River. He took the important city of Jericho and then captured other towns in the north and south until most of Palestine was brought under Israelite control. He divided the conquered lands among the 12 tribes of Israel and then bade farewell to his people (Joshua 23), admonishing them to be loyal to the God of the covenant.
A careful reading of relevant biblical texts, stimulated by the study of external resources, has led scholars to a general agreement that Israel did not take Canaan by means of a single, comprehensive, calculated plan of conquest. It happened more gradually and more naturally, through progressive infiltration and acculturation. This relatively peaceful development, which went on for a couple of centuries, reached its fulfillment in the rise of David. Until then, for the most part, walled cities remained in Canaanite hands. Even if these cities were razed, as in the case of Hazor (Joshua 11), Israel does not seem to have made military use of them; David’s occupation of Jerusalem was a first in this respect. The accounts of Joshua’s campaigns (Joshua 10–11) seem to fit these realities; they are accounts of forays by a mobile community, moving ever westward, that increasingly constituted a force to be reckoned with in the open spaces between the walled cities.
