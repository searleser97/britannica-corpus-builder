Caleb,   in the Old Testament, one of the spies sent by Moses from Kadesh in southern Palestine to spy out the land of Canaan. Only Caleb and Joshua advised the Hebrews to proceed immediately to take the land; for his faith Caleb was rewarded with the promise that he and his descendants should possess it (Numbers 13–14). Subsequently Caleb settled in Hebron (Kiriatharba) after driving out the three sons of Anak; he gave his daughter Achsah to Othniel, his brother, who took nearby Debir (Joshua 15:13–19; cf. Joshua 14:6–15; Judges 1:10–20).
The stories of Caleb probably represent the movements of a clan that invaded Palestine from the south, settled in the region of Hebron and southward, and eventually became absorbed in the tribe of Judah. Mention of this clan arises when Caleb is referred to as “the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite” and when his brother Othniel is called a “son of Kenaz.” That this clan was eventually absorbed into the tribe of Judah is indicated by the fact that Caleb is described as being from the tribe of Judah in Numbers 13:6 and 34:19 and that Judah in the later tradition was considered to have given Hebron to Caleb (Judges 1:20). In the genealogies of 1 Chronicles 2, Caleb is apparently a descendant of Judah. Because the word caleb means “dog,” some scholars believe the dog was originally the totem of the clan.
