Ananda,  (flourished 6th century bc, India), first cousin of the Buddha and one of his principal disciples, known as his “beloved disciple” and devoted companion.
Ananda entered the order of monks in the second year of the Buddha’s ministry and in the 25th year was appointed his personal attendant. According to the Vinaya Pitaka texts, he persuaded the Buddha, much against the Buddha’s own inclination, to allow women to become nuns. Of the Buddha’s intimate disciples, Ananda alone had not attained enlightenment when the Buddha died. He attained it, however, just before the first council (c. 544 or 480 bc), at which he repeated the Sutta Pitaka (“Basket of Discourse”). He is represented as being the interlocutor in many discourses and the actual author of several. A collection of verses is ascribed to him in the Theragatha. According to tradition, he lived to the age of 120.
