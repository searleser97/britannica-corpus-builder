Letter of Paul to Philemon, also called Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to Philemon, abbreviation Philemon,  brief New Testament letter written by St. Paul the Apostle to a wealthy Christian of Colossae, in the ancient Roman province of Asia (now in western Turkey), on behalf of Onesimus, who was enslaved to Philemon and may have run away from him. The epistle is the 18th book of the New Testament canon and was probably composed in Rome about 61 ce.
Paul, writing from prison, expresses affection for the newly converted Onesimus and asks Philemon to receive him as Philemon would receive Paul himself, even though Onesimus may be guilty of previous failings. While passing no judgment on slavery itself, Paul exhorts Philemon to manifest true Christian love, which removes barriers between enslaved people and free people.
