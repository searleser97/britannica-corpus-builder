The Confessions,  spiritual self-examination by Saint Augustine, written in Latin as Confessiones about 400 ce. The book tells of Augustineâ€™s restless youth and of the stormy spiritual voyage that had ended some 12 years before the writing in the haven of the Roman Catholic church. In reality, the work is not so much autobiography as an exploration of the philosophical and emotional development of an individual soul. The Confessions broke entirely fresh ground as literature, and the genre of autobiography owes many of its characteristics to Augustine.
