Jacob Bar Salibi, also called Dionysius Bar Salibi,  (died November 2, 1171), the great spokesman of the Jacobite (miaphysite) church in the 12th century.
A native of Melitene (now Malatya, Turkey), Bar Salibi was made bishop of Marash in 1154 and, a year later, of Mabbog as well. In 1166 he was transferred to the metropolitan see of Amid (DiyarbakÄ±r), where he remained until his death. His works included poems, prayers, homilies, liturgies, a commentary on the six Centuries of Evagrius with the text translated into Syriac, a treatise against heresies, expositions of the Syrian Eucharistic service and doctrine, and commentaries on the Old and New Testaments. The Old Testament commentary, a compilation rather than an original composition, gives a material or literal exposition and a spiritual or mystical exposition. The New Testament commentary, less developed except on the Gospels, also deals with the text on two levels.
