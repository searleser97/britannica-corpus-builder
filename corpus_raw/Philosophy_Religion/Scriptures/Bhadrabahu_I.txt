Bhadrabahu I,  (died 298 bce, India),  Jain religious leader and monk often associated with one of Jainism’s two principal sects, the Digambara.
According to Digambara tradition, in 310 bce, after a 12-year famine, Bhadrabahu and Chandragupta—the first king of the Mauryan dynasty, who had become a Jain monk—led an exodus from the Jain stronghold in northern India. That migration, to Shravanabelagola in what is now the state of Karnataka in southwestern India, is recognized by some scholars, particularly in the West, as the beginning of the schism in the Jain community between the Digambara (“Sky-Clad”; i.e., naked) and Shvetambara (“White-Robed”) sects.
Bhadrabahu reputedly authored three of Jainism’s sacred books as well as the Niryuktis, short commentaries on 10 of the 12 original sacred books. Some authorities say that, after the famine, Bhadrabahu retired in seclusion to Nepal; others say he remained in Mysore. He is reputed to have undergone the process of sallekhana, the Jain ritual of ultimate triumph over human passions in which the believer renounces the world completely and starves to death.
