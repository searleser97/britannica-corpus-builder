The Lamentations of Jeremiah, also called The Lamentations Of Jeremias,  Old Testament book belonging to the third section of the biblical canon, known as the Ketuvim, or Writings. In the Hebrew Bible, Lamentations stands with Ruth, the Song of Solomon, Ecclesiastes, and Esther and with them makes up the Megillot, five scrolls that are read on various festivals of the Jewish religious year. In the Jewish liturgical calendar, Lamentations is the festal scroll of the Ninth of Av, a day commemorating the destruction of the First and Second Temples of Jerusalem.
Most of the Christian English translations of the Bible, following the lead of the later Greek versions and the Latin versions, call the book The Lamentations of Jeremiah, though its title in the Talmud and the Septuagint is simply Lamentations. The content and style, however, argue against Jeremiahâ€™s authorship. Each of the first four chapters consists of an acrostic poem. Although the 5th chapter consists of 22 verses, it is not, strictly speaking, an alphabetic acrostic. The poems are independent units, but their mood and content provide a unity to the book as a whole. Because the poems are laments over the destruction of Judah, Jerusalem, and the Temple by the Babylonians in 586 bc, they must be dated during the exile that followed.
