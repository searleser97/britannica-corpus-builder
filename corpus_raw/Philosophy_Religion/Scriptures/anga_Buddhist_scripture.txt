Aṅgā, (Pāli and Sanskrit: “limb,” or “division”)  any of several categories into which Buddhist canonical writings were divided in early times, beginning before the Abhidhamma (scholastic) works were added to the canon. The system, based on a combination of form and content, originally categorized types of material within the various texts; later, it was used to classify the texts themselves. The Theravāda and Mahāsaṅghika schools used an ancient ninefold division; a system of 12 categories was the most common division in other schools, especially Mahāyāna.
The nine aṅgās in Pāli, with their Sanskrit counterparts where different, are:
The 12-fold Sanskrit system adds these categories:
Nidāna (“cause”), a classification for introductory material and historical narratives.
Avadāna (“Noble Deeds”), Buddha’s stories of the good deeds in people’s former lives and their present results (see Apadāna).
Upadeśa (“instruction”), discussions of doctrine—sometimes esoteric doctrine—often in question-and-answer form. The term has also been used for Abhidhamma (scholastic section of the canon), for philosophical treatises, for Tantric works, and for commentaries.
