Bel and the Dragon, in full The History Of The Destruction Of Bel And The Dragon,  Greek apocryphal addition to the biblical Book of Daniel. It is a deuterocanonical work in that it is accepted in the Roman canon but not by Jews or Protestants. It tells of the Jewish hero Daniel, who refuses to worship the god Bel and kills the dragon, thus being forced into a den of lions, which he is allowed to leave after seven days because he is unharmed. His enemies, advocates of idolatry, are later cast into the lionsâ€™ den and devoured.
