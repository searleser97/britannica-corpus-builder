Polyglot Bible,  any of several editions of the Bible in which the text consists of translations in various languages arranged in parallel columns. This arrangement allows scholars to compare ancient and modern versions, as well as to examine closely the translation from one language to another.
The first and best known polyglot Bible is the Complutensian, begun in 1502 under the sponsorship of the archbishop of Toledo, Cardinal Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros, printed in 1514–17 at the University of Alcalá de Henares near Madrid, and published in 1522. The Old Testament in the Complutensian contained a revised Masoretic Hebrew text and translations in Aramaic (the Targum of Onkelos), Latin (the Vulgate), and Greek (the Lucianic recension of the Septuagint, printed in full for the first time). The Complutensian New Testament presented the original Greek version together with the Latin translation.
The Biblia Regia, or Antwerp Polyglot (1569–72), is another important polyglot. The work, paid for by Philip II of Spain, was supervised by the Spanish scholar Benedictus Arias Montanus and printed in Antwerp by a well-known printer, Christophe Plantin.
One of the most comprehensive and generally considered the finest is the London Polyglot, also called the Londoninesis or Waltonian (1657), compiled by Brian Walton, with the aid of many contemporary scholars; the Waltonian was one of the first English books assembled under public subscription. Its six volumes contain a total of nine languages: Hebrew, Samaritan, Aramaic, Greek, Latin, Ethiopic, Syriac, Arabic, and Persian.
