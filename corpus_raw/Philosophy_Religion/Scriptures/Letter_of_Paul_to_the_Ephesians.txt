Letter of Paul to the Ephesians, also called Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians,abbreviationEphesians,  tenth book of the New Testament, once thought to have been composed by St. Paul the Apostle in prison but more likely the work of one of his disciples. The words “in Ephesus” are lacking in the earliest manuscripts and citations, and the author probably wrote the text sometime before 90 ce while consulting Paul’s letter to the Colossians (see Letter of Paul to the Colossians). Of the 155 verses in Ephesians, 73 have verbal parallels with Colossians, and, when parallels to genuine Pauline epistles are added, 85 percent of Ephesians is duplicated elsewhere. It is thus most reasonable to consider it as “deutero-Pauline”—i.e., in the tradition of Paul but not written by him.
The letter declares that the Christian mystery (gospel) of salvation, first revealed to the Apostles, is the source of true wisdom (perhaps an indirect repudiation of Gnostic claims to esoteric knowledge of the supernatural) and that salvation through Christ is offered to Jews and Gentiles alike. The writer affirms that there is but “one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all” (4:5–6), who united all things in Christ, through whose death all humans are redeemed. The author exhorts his readers—parents and children, masters and slaves—to lead exemplary Christian lives and to arm themselves with the “shield of faith,” “the helmet of salvation,” and “the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God” (6:16–17), in order to resist the wiles of the devil.
