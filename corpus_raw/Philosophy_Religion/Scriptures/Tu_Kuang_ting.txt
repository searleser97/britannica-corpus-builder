Tu Kuang-t’ing, Pinyin Du Guangting,  (born 850—died 933), , Taoist scholar of the T’ang period who contributed to the development of Taoist liturgical ritual and the blending of the T’ien-shih and Ling-pao scriptures. His ideas on Taoist ritual were especially influential in the articulation of the common Taoist “fasting,” or chia, rites and of the liturgies, or chiao, of communal renewal. He also wrote a famous commentary on the Tao-te ching and several important hagiographical accounts of Taoist immortals and adepts.
