Dasam Granth,   collection of writings attributed to Gurū Gobind Singh, the tenth and last spiritual leader of the Sikhs, a religious group in India. Dasam Granth is a short title for Dasven Pādśāh kā Graṅth (Punjabi: “The Book of the Tenth Emperor [i.e., spiritual leader]”). It is a compilation of hymns, philosophical writing, Hindu mythological tales, autobiography, and erotic fables, written in Braj Bhasa, Hindi, Persian, and Punjabi. Scholars are not in agreement as to the work’s total authenticity, and it may represent a bringing together of Gurū Gobind Singh’s own writings with those from other sources, such as his court poets. Though some of the hymns are used in Sikh worship and ritual, the Dasam Granth is not accorded the same reverence paid to the chief Sikh scripture, the Ādi Granth.
