Sishu, (Chinese: “Four Books”) Wade-Giles romanization Ssu-shu,  four ancient Confucian texts that were used as official subject matter for civil service examinations in China from 1313 to 1905 and that usually serve to introduce Chinese students to Confucian literature. Students later turn to the more extensive and, generally speaking, more difficult Wujing (“Five Classics”).
The publication of these four texts as a unit in 1190, with commentaries by the Neo-Confucian philosopher Zhu Xi, helped to revitalize Confucianism in China. From 1415 onward, knowledge of Zhu’s commentaries was indispensable to success in civil service examinations.
Even with its commentaries, the Sishu is a modest volume, the four parts of which have no consistent order. The first, Daxue (“Great Learning”), is a short ethico-political treatise linking humane government with the personal integrity of rulers. The second, Zhongyong (“Doctrine of the Mean”), is more abstract than the other three books. It speaks of such things as the “Way of Heaven,” motion, spiritual beings, and religious sacrifices. Zhu wrote an individual preface for each of these two books (both direct excerpts from Liji [“Record of Rites”], one of the Five Classics). The third book, Lunyu (“Conversations,” or “Analects”), reputedly contains direct quotations from the ancient sage Confucius as recorded by his disciples, especially Zengzi. It is considered the most reliable source of Confucius’s teachings. Mencius, the fourth and longest text of the Sishu, contains the teachings of the revered Confucian scholar Mencius, who emphasized the essential goodness of human nature.
