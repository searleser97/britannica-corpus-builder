Muratorian Fragment,  a late 2nd-century-ce fragment of a Latin list of New Testament writings then regarded by Christians as canonical (scripturally authoritative). It was named for its discoverer, Lodovico Antonio Muratori, an Italian scholar who published the manuscript in 1740. The list mentions two of the four Gospels (Luke and John, in their traditional order), the Acts of the Apostles, the 13 letters attributed to the Apostle Paul, the Letter of Jude, two letters of John, the Wisdom of Solomon, and the apocalypses of John and of Peter. The Shepherd of Hermas was listed as a book for private devotions.
