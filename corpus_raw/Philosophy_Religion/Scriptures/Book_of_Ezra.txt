Books of Ezra and Nehemiah, also spelled Esdras and Nehemias,  two Old Testament books that together with the books of Chronicles formed a single history of Israel from the time of Adam. Ezra and Nehemiah are a single book in the Jewish canon. Roman Catholics long associated the two, calling the second “Esdras alias Nehemias” in the Douay-Confraternity. Later works, e.g., the Jerusalem Bible, maintain separate identities but associate the books. Protestants treat them separately.
The connection of Ezra–Nehemiah with I and II Chronicles is clear from the repetition of the closing verses of II Chronicles in the opening verses of Ezra. The uniformity of language, style, and ideas of the two books and Chronicles mark the entire work as the product of a single author, known as the Chronicler. He belongs to a period after the Babylonian Exile, probably about 350–300 bc.
Ezra 1–6 treats the return of the exiles and the rebuilding of the Temple of Jerusalem. The work of Ezra and Nehemiah in reconstituting the life of the people following the Exile is told in Ezra 7–Nehemiah 13. Textual dislocations raise a question about the chronological sequence of Ezra and Nehemiah to which there is no solid answer.
The activity recounted in Ezra 7 to Nehemiah 13 represents the Chronicler’s view of how the life of his people should be organized in the postexilic period with a religious revival in conformity with Mosaic laws.
