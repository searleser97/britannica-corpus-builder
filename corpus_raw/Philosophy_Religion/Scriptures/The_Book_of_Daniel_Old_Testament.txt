The Book of Daniel, also called The Prophecy Of Daniel,  a book of the Old Testament found in the Ketuvim (Writings), the third section of the Jewish canon, but placed among the Prophets in the Christian canon. The first half of the book (chapters 1–6) contains stories in the third person about the experiences of Daniel and his friends under Kings Nebuchadrezzar II, Belshazzar, Darius I, and Cyrus II; the second half, written mostly in the first person, contains reports of Daniel’s three visions (and one dream). The second half of the book names as author a certain Daniel who, according to chapter 1, was exiled to Babylon.
The language of the book—part of which is Aramaic (2:4–7:28)—probably indicates a date of composition later than the Babylonian Exile (6th century bc). Numerous inaccuracies connected with the exilic period (no deportation occurred in 605 bc; Darius was a successor of Cyrus, not a predecessor; etc.) tend to confirm this judgment. Because its religious ideas do not belong to the 6th century bc, numerous scholars date Daniel in the first half of the 2nd century bc and relate the visions to the persecution of the Jews under Antiochus IV Epiphanes (175–164/163 bc).
Daniel, extolled for his upright character, is presented as a model for the persecuted community. The unknown author may have drawn inspiration from Ugaritic and Phoenician sources that speak of a legendary figure notable for his righteousness and wisdom.
The book takes an apocalyptic view of history: the end time is vividly anticipated when the reign of God will be established and the faithful, through a resurrection of the just, will be relieved of their suffering. The book exhorts its hearers and readers to endure, even to the point of martyrdom.
In the Roman Catholic Old Testament, the book includes also The Prayer of Azariah, Song of the Three Young Men, Susanna, and Bel and the Dragon—writings considered apocryphal by Jews and Protestants.
