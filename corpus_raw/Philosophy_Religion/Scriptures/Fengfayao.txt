Fengfayao, (Chinese: “Essentials of the Dharma”) Wade-Giles romanization Feng-fa-yao,  discussion of Buddhist precepts written in the 4th century ce by Xi Chao, who, though a Daoist, was a great admirer of Buddhism. One of the earliest discourses on the subject by a non-Buddhist, it is regarded as a milestone in the advance of Buddhist thought in China. Although it contains some erroneous interpretations of Buddhist ideas, the Fengfayao is comparable in its accuracy to the works of Xi Chao’s Chinese Buddhist counterparts.
