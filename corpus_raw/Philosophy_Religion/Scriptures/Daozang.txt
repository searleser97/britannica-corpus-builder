Daozang, (Chinese: “Canon of the Way”) Wade-Giles romanization Tao Tsang, also called Daoist Canon,  a large, imperially sponsored collection of Daoist writings, very few of which have been translated into English. The original canon, printed by the Daoist emperors of the Song dynasty (960–1279 ce), comprised almost 5,000 volumes, but many of these were destroyed by imperial decree during the Yuan, or Mongol, dynasty (1279–1368). The present Daozang, numbering well over 1,000 volumes, contains a variety of texts including speculative philosophical writings and esoteric works on Daoist meditation, alchemy, and divine revelation.
