Ad-Damīrī, in full Muḥammad Ibn Mūsā Kamāl Ad-dīn Ad-damīrī,  (born 1341, Cairo, Egypt—died  Oct. 27, 1405, Cairo), Muslim theologian, best known for his encyclopaedia of animals.
A student of some of the leading scholars of his day, ad-Damīrī mastered theology as well as law and philology. He gave lectures and sermons regularly at several schools and mosques of Cairo, including al-Azhar University. A Ṣūfī, or mystic, he was known for his asceticism, prayers, and fastings. He performed the pilgrimage to Mecca six times.
His encyclopaedia, Ḥayāt al-ḥayawān (c. 1371; partial Eng. trans. by A.S.G. Jayakar, A Zoological Lexicon, 2 vol.), is extant in three Arabic versions of different lengths and in Persian, Turkish, and Latin translations. It treats in alphabetical order the 931 animals mentioned in the Qurʾān, in the Ḥadīth, and in Arab poetry and proverbs. The use of the animals in medicine, their lawfulness or unlawfulness as food, and their position in folklore are the main subjects treated. There are also digressions; e.g., the discussion of geese is dominated by a history of the caliphs and is intended to show that every sixth caliph abdicated. The other works of ad-Damīrī were devoted to subjects more typical of Islāmic scholastic tradition.
