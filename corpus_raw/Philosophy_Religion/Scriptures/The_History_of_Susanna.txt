The History of Susanna,  apocryphal addition to the Old Testament Book of Daniel; it appears in both the Septuagint (Greek) and Vulgate (Latin) versions. In the latter it constitutes the last chapter, but in many editions of the former it is the introductory chapter. In the Roman canon it is the penultimate chapter (13). Based on the traditional motif of the triumph of righteousness over sin, the story has two concurrent themes, of an innocent woman falsely accused of adultery, and of a wise judge.
