Ketuvim,  (Hebrew), English Writings, Greek Hagiographa,  the third division of the Hebrew Bible, or Old Testament. Divided into four sections, the Ketuvim include: poetical books (Psalms, Proverbs, and Job), the Megillot, or Scrolls (Song of Solomon, Ruth, Lamentations of Jeremiah, Ecclesiastes, and Esther), prophecy (Daniel), and history (Ezra, Nehemiah, and I and II Chronicles).
Thus the Ketuvim are a miscellaneous collection of liturgical poetry, secular love poetry, wisdom literature, history, apocalyptic literature, a short story, and a romantic tale. They were composed over a long period of time—from before the Babylonian Exile in the early 6th century bc to the middle of the 2nd century bc—and were not entirely accepted as canonical until the 2nd century ad. Unlike the Torah and the Neviʾim (Prophets), which were canonized as groups, each book of the Ketuvim was canonized separately, often on the basis of its popularity.
