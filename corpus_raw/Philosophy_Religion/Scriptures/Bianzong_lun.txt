Bianzong lun, (Chinese: “Discussions of Essentials”) Wade-Giles romanization Pien-tsung-lun,  treatise by Xie Lingyun, an early Chinese Buddhist intellectual and renowned poet, valued chiefly as one of the few sources of information about the author’s eminent teacher, Daosheng 434 ce. According to Daosheng, enlightenment is a sudden and all-encompassing experience, rather than a gradual process as described by his contemporaries. This assertion, firmly grounded in the teaching of the undividedness of truth promoted by the Prajnaparamita (Sanskrit: “Perfection of Wisdom”) movement,  influenced early Chinese Buddhist thinkers and generated widespread intellectual debate in China.
