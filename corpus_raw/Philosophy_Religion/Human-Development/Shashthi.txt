Shashthi,  in Hinduism, a deity who is the goddess of vegetation, reproduction, and infant welfare. Shashthi is especially venerated in eastern India, largely in Bengal and Odisha. The name Shashthi means “the sixth” and is derived from the name of the sixth day after the birth of a child, the end of the period in which the child and the mother are in greatest danger. On that day and on the sixth day of the lunar fortnight, worship is ordinarily offered to Shashthi in her role as custodian of infant welfare. In Bengal a subclass of the literary genre known as mangal-kavya is devoted to works celebrating her exploits and majesty. Those works are known as the Shashthi-mangal.
