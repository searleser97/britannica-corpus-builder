al-Fāsī, in full Yūsuf ibn Muḥammad ibn Yūsuf al-Fāsī,  (born 1530/31?, Ksar el-Kebir, Morocco—died  Aug. 14, 1604, Fès), Muslim teacher and mystic who was prominent in the intellectual life of northwest Africa.
The details of al-Fāsī’s life are obscure. After his family emigrated from Spain, he settled in the capital of Fès in 1580. His reputation as a teacher and scholar soon attracted many students. Noted for his piety, he founded a zāwiyah (lodge), which became popular among travelers. His traditions of scholarship were continued after his death by his son and by his son’s progeny. The members of the Fāsīyyūn family were the intellectual leaders of 17th-century Morocco.
