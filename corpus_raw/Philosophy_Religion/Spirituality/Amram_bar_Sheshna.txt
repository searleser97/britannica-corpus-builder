Amram bar Sheshna,   (died 875?), head of the Talmudic academy at Sura, Babylonia, traditionally regarded as the first Jewish authority to write a complete domestic and synagogal liturgy for the year, the Siddur Rav Amram (“Order of Prayers of Rabbi Amram”). Amram’s work, forerunner in this field of those of Saʿadia ben Joseph and Maimonides, laid the foundations for the liturgies of both the Sephardim (Spanish Jews) and Ashkenazim (Germanic Jews). In addition to the prayers, his liturgy included a related Talmudic commentary. Surviving in manuscript form, it was first published (in two parts) in Warsaw in 1865. Neither the first part, composed of the main body of prayers, nor the second, consisting of propitiatory prayers and liturgical poems for the month of Elul (August–September), the New Year, and the Day of Atonement, can be definitely attributed to Amram, and it is obvious that many of the devotions and interpolations are by other hands.
Amram also composed numerous responsa (replies to inquiries about Jewish Law), which, touching upon such subjects as dietary restrictions and regulations for sabbaths and holidays, reveal much of the Jewish Law and custom of his time.
