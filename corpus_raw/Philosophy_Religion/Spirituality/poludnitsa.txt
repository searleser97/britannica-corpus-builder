Poludnitsa,   in Slavic mythology, female field spirit, generally seen either as a tall woman or a girl dressed in white. The poludnitsa customarily appears in the field at noon, when the workers are resting from their labours. Any human who dares upset her traditional visit risks his health and his life.
The poludnitsa is related to the polevoy, the male field spirit, who is seldom seen and then only at noon in the fields. Some describe him as a man black as the earth, with grass instead of hair growing out of his head. Others say he dresses in white. In some areas offerings are made to the polevoy at night to ensure fertility.
