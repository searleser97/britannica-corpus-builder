Crown of Thorns,  wreath of thorns that was placed on the head of Jesus Christ at his crucifixion, whereby the Roman soldiers mocked his title “King of the Jews.” The relic purported to be the Crown of Thorns was transferred from Jerusalem to Constantinople by 1063. The French king Louis IX (St. Louis) took the relic to Paris about 1238 and had the Sainte-Chapelle built (1242–48) to house it. The thornless remains are kept in the treasury of Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris; they survived a devastating fire in April 2019 that destroyed the church’s roof and spire.
