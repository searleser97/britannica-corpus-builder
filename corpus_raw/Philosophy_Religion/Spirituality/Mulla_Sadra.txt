Mullā Ṣadrā, also called Ṣadr Ad-dīn Ash-shīrāzī,  (born c. 1571, Shīrāz, Iran—died  1640, Basra, Iraq), philosopher, who led the Iranian cultural renaissance in the 17th century. The foremost representative of the illuminationist, or Ishrāqī, school of philosopher-mystics, he is commonly regarded by Iranians as the greatest philosopher their country has produced.
A scion of a notable Shīrāzī family, Mullā Ṣadrā completed his education at Eṣfahān, then the leading cultural and intellectual centre of Iran. After his studies with scholars there, he produced several works, the most famous of which was his Asfār (“Journeys”). Asfār contains the bulk of his philosophy, which was influenced by a personal mysticism bordering on the ascetic that he experienced during a 15-year retreat at Kahak, a village near Qom, Iran.
Expounding his theory of nature, Mullā Ṣadrā argued that the entire universe—except God and his Knowledge—was originated both eternally as well as temporally. Nature, he asserted, is the substance of all things and is the cause for all movement. Thus, nature is permanent and furnishes the continuing link between the eternal and the originated.
Toward the end of his life, Mullā Ṣadrā returned to Shīrāz to teach. His teachings, however, were considered heretical by the orthodox Shīʿite theologians, who persecuted him, though his powerful family connections permitted him to continue to write. He died on a pilgrimage to Arabia.
