Guardian spirit,  supernatural teacher, frequently depicted in animal form, who guides an individual in every important activity through advice and songs; the belief in guardian spirits is widely diffused among the North American Indians.
In some traditions the guardian manifests itself in a dream or by other portents. In other traditions it is the individual who sets out to discover his guardian by undertaking a vision quest (q.v.).
