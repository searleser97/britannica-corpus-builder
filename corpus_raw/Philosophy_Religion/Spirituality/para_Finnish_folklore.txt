Para,  in Finnish folklore, a spirit who was believed to bring wealth to the farm that was lucky enough to harbour him. The term is derived from the Swedish word bjära (“bearer”). Underlying belief in the para was a notion that there was only a limited amount of good fortune available to all members of society at any time. Thus, any one individual or family succeeded at obtaining benefit only at the expense of others. What the para brought to one farm disappeared from another, whether it was grain, milk, or butter. The para could appear in the form of animals that were seen frequently around the farmstead, such as a snake, dog, or rabbit. It could also be constructed by a farmwife envious of her neighbours. One typical form consisted of a spindle wrapped with yarn for a body and a communion wafer for a heart. This creation was spun on the floor while an incantation was recited for the birth of the para.
