Mechitarist, also spelled Mekhitarist,  member of the Congregation of Benedictine Armenian Antonine Monks, a Roman Catholic congregation of monks that is widely recognized for its contribution to the renaissance of Armenian philology, literature, and culture early in the 19th century and particularly for the publication of old Armenian Christian manuscripts.
The congregation, whose constitution is based on the Rule of St. Benedict, was founded in Constantinople (now Istanbul) in 1701 by the Armenian priest Mekhitar Petrosian of Sivas. Driven from Constantinople in 1703, the Mechitarists moved to Modon in Morea (1703–15) and finally settled in 1717 on the island of San Lazzaro, Venice, which was given to them by the Venetian state. This community, known as the Ordo Mechitaristarum Venetiarum, argued over a revised constitution set up by Abbot Stephen Melkonen, and in 1772 a group of dissidents left Venice for Trieste, establishing a separate branch (Ordo Mechitaristarum Vindobonensis) in Vienna (c. 1810).
The Armenian Academy at San Lazzaro, which was set up in Rome by the Venetian Mechitarists in the early 19th century, quickly became a centre of Armenian learning. The academy introduced the scientific and literary journal Pazmaveb in 1843, pioneered a dictionary of the Armenian language (1836), and continues to publish many classics and original works of scholarship in Armenian. The Venetian branch of the congregation maintains five religious houses, two colleges, and four schools, as well as the publishing house.
The Viennese Mechitarists are active missionaries. They worked among the Armenians under the Austro-Hungarian Empire and established parishes in Budapest, Cambridge (Mass.), and Los Angeles. Their motherhouse in Vienna incorporates a school, library, museum of ancient Armenian art, and a publishing house that issues Handés Amsorya (1887), a journal of Armenian philology. They also run colleges in Istanbul and Beirut.
