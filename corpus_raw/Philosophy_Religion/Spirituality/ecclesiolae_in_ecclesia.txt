Ecclesiolae in ecclesia,   (Latin: “little churches within the church”), the revival in 1727 of the Hussite Unitas Fratrum, or Unity of Brethren, within the framework of the established Lutheran church of Saxony.
Some of the survivors of the Unity communities, which had been destroyed in the early 17th-century Counter-Reformation, had been living underground in Moravia and Bohemia. They were invited in 1722 by Nikolaus Ludwig, Graf von Zinzendorf, to settle on his estate of Berthelsdorf in Lusatia. By 1727 enough refugees had arrived in the settlement that they called Herrnhut to make restoration of the Unity possible, at first as a group within the Lutheran church. Later, however, the renewed Moravian church emerged as a denomination independent of the Lutheran church.
The phrase ecclesiolae in ecclesia was also applied by John Wesley to Methodist societies working for renewal in the Church of England.
