Aiyetoro, (Yoruba: “Happy City”)  utopian Christian settlement of the Nigerian Holy Apostles’ Community established in 1947. The Holy Apostles’ Community was founded by a small group of the Cherubim and Seraphim Society, itself a part of the Aladura religious movement (a Charismatic Christian movement having affinities with Pentecostalism). The founders of Aiyetoro built the model settlement on piles on a mudbank in the coastal lagoons 100 miles (160 km) east of Lagos. Though anyone could join, offenders against the community’s strict ethical code were sent away. The day opened with worship in the church or in the palace courtyard and sometimes ended with a form of communion meal. Members believed that death had been conquered and that those who die will return to the community.
Until the early 1980s up to 3,000 members lived in a communal, nonfamilial society under a spiritual leader-ruler. The community had electricity as well as its own schools, nursery, post office, and industries that supplied the community’s needs at first and later produced various products for export. After production for export began, the growth of private enterprise undermined the communal basis of the economy, and both the religious mission and the communal organization of the settlement were abandoned.
