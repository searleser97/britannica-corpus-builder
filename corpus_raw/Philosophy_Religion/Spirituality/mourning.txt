Mourning,   formal demonstration of grief at the death of a person, practiced in most societies. Mourners are usually relatives, although they may be friends or members of the community. Mourning rites, which are of varying duration and rationale, usually weigh more heavily on women than on men. Mourners may deny themselves certain amusement, ornaments, or food. They may practice sexual continence or keep vigil over the body of the deceased. Changes in garb, such as black robes, and alterations in hairstyle may distinguish mourners, but such evidences of mourning have declined in many societies.
