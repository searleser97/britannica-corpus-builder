Guei, (Chinese: “ghost” or “demon”) Wade-Giles romanization kuei, also spelled gui,  in indigenous Chinese religion, a troublesome spirit that roams the world causing misfortune, illness, and death.
Guei are spirits of individuals who were not properly buried or whose families neglected the proper memorial offerings; they lack the means to ascend to the spirit world, hence their malevolent disposition. In traditional China, numerous protective rituals and talismans were devised to ward guei away from the family abode, and the main entrance was usually screened by a protective “shadow wall.” See also shen.
