Jan van Ruysbroeck,  Jan also rendered Johannes, Ruysbroeck also spelled Ruusbroec,  (born 1293, Ruisbroek, near Brussels, Brabant [now in Belgium]—died Dec. 2, 1381, Groenendaal, Brabant), Flemish mystic whose writings influenced Johann Tauler, Gerhard Groote, and other mystics.
After holding the chaplaincy of Sainte Gudule, Brussels, from 1317 to 1343, Ruysbroeck founded the Augustinian abbey at Groenendaal, where he wrote all but the first of his works, Van den Rike der Ghelieven (The Kingdom of the Lovers of God). Ruysbroeck derived much from the mystic Hadewijch, who had viewed the relationship of the soul to God as similar to that between the lover and the beloved. Ruysbroeck’s systematic compendium of teaching and belief, however, contrasted with the more introspective nature of Meister Eckehart’s writings. Die Chierheit der gheesteliker Brulocht (1350; The Spiritual Espousals), considered to be his masterpiece, develops his view of the Trinity and is a guide for the soul in search of God. Though his many writings were produced for his contemporary Augustinians, they spread rapidly through Latin translations and anticipated the 15th-century devotio moderna, whose most representative work is Imitatio Christi, ascribed to Thomas à Kempis. Ruysbroeck was beatified in 1908; his feast is traditionally celebrated on the anniversary of his death.
