Chinese Rites Controversy,  a 17th–18th-century argument originating in China among Roman Catholic missionaries about whether the ceremonies honouring Confucius and family ancestors were so tainted with superstition as to be incompatible with Christian belief. The Jesuits believed that they probably were not and that they could be tolerated within certain limits; the Dominicans and Franciscans took the opposite view and carried the issue to Rome. In 1645 the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith, on the basis of a brief submitted by the Dominicans, condemned the rites. After considering the arguments of the Jesuits, however, the same congregation lifted the ban in 1656.
The continuing controversy involved leading universities in Europe, was considered by eight popes and by the Kangxi emperor, and led to repeated intervention by the offices of the Holy See. By the end of the 17th century, many Dominicans and Franciscans had come to share the Jesuits’ opinion, but Rome disagreed. In a decree of 1704, reinforced by a bull in 1715, Clement XI banned the rites. Benedict XIV in 1742 reaffirmed the prohibition and forbade further debate.
Almost two centuries later the Holy See re-examined the question. A decree of Dec. 8, 1939, authorized Christians to take part in ceremonies honouring Confucius and to observe the ancestral rites. The second Vatican Council (1962–65) proclaimed the principle of admitting native ceremonies into the liturgy of the church whenever possible.
