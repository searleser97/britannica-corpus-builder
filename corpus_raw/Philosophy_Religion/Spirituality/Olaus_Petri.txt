Olaus Petri, Swedish Olof Petersson,  (born January 6?, 1493, Örebro, Sweden—died April 19, 1552, Stockholm), Lutheran churchman who, with his brother Laurentius, played a decisive role in the reformation of the Swedish church.
He studied at Wittenberg (1516–18) and absorbed the reformed teaching of Martin Luther and Philipp Melanchthon. When Gustavus Vasa was crowned king in 1523, Olaus had already attracted attention and criticism by his preaching. The Roman Catholic hierarchy was hostile to the king, who became a supporter of the reformed teaching. During the reign of Gustavus Vasa, Olaus rose in prominence and served briefly as chancellor (1531). Later, because he opposed the autocratic policy of the king, he fell from favour and was condemned to death in 1540, the sentence being remitted for a heavy fine. He regained favour, however, and was appointed pastor of Storkyrkan (the Cathedral of St. Nicholas) in Stockholm. Olaus provided most of the literature for the Swedish Reformation movement, including a Swedish New Testament, hymnbook, church manual, the Swedish liturgy, and many homiletical and polemical writings. His Chronicle is an important historical document.
