Jāmī, in full Mowlanā Nūr Od-dīn ʿabd Or-raḥmān Ebn Aḥmad,  (born Nov. 7, 1414, district of Jam—died  Nov. 9, 1492, Herāt, Timurid Afghanistan), Persian scholar, mystic, and poet who is often regarded as the last great mystical poet of Iran.
Jāmī spent his life in Herāt, except for two brief pilgrimages to Meshed (Iran) and the Hejaz. During his lifetime his fame as a scholar resulted in numerous offers of patronage by many of the contemporary Islāmic rulers. He declined most of these offers, preferring the simple life of a mystic and scholar to that of a court poet. His work is notably devoid of panegyrics. His prose deals with a variety of subjects ranging from Qurʾānic commentaries to treatises on Ṣūfism (Islāmic mysticism) and music. Perhaps the most famous is his mystical treatise Lava’iḥ (Flashes of Light), a clear and precise exposition of the Ṣūfī doctrines of waḥdat al-wujūd (the existential unity of Being), together with a commentary on the experiences of other famous mystics.
Jāmī’s poetical works express his ethical and philosophical doctrines. His poetry is fresh and graceful and is not marred by unduly esoteric language. His most famous collection of poetry is a seven-part compendium entitled Haft Awrang (“The Seven Thrones,” or “Ursa Major”), which includes Salmān o-Absāl and Yūsof o-Zalīkhā. Although this collection is modeled on the works of the 13th-century romantic poet Neẓāmī, it bears Jāmī’s unmistakable mark of originality and intellectual vigour.
