Little Brothers of Jesus and Little Sisters of Jesus,   Roman Catholic religious congregations inspired by the example of Charles-Eugène de Foucauld, a French military officer and explorer who experienced a religious conversion in 1886, while serving in Morocco. He later lived as a hermit among the Tuareg tribesmen in the Sahara Desert before he was shot and killed by a band of Senusi tribesmen in 1916.
The Little Brothers were founded in 1933 by René Voillaume in southern Oran, Alg.; the Little Sisters were founded in September 1939 at Touggourt, Alg., by Sister Madeleine of Jesus. Both congregations live in small groups, called fraternities, in ordinary dwellings among the poor labouring classes. They hold the same type of jobs as their neighbours hold. Their hope is that their presence among the people will influence an acceptance of Christianity.
