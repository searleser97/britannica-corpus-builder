Passionist, member of  Congregation of the Passion, formally Congregation of the Discalced Clerks of the Most Holy Cross and Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ (C.P.),  a religious order of men in the Roman Catholic church, founded by Paolo Francesco Danei (now known as St. Paul of the Cross) in Italy in 1720 to spread devotion to the sufferings and death on the Cross of Jesus Christ.
The Passionists fulfill their mission by preaching about Jesus Christ throughout the world. The members of the order follow an austere rule of life that calls for common recitation of the liturgical office, three days of fasting each week, and other penances. Their habit consists of a black tunic and mantle with a leather belt and rosary. The tunic and mantle have a heart-shaped badge, bearing a white cross and three nails with the inscription Jesu XPI Passio (Passion of Jesus Christ).
St. Paul also founded the Passionist Nuns (Nuns of the Cross and Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ), approved by Pope Clement XIV in 1771. Passionist Sisters were established in 1852 in England.
