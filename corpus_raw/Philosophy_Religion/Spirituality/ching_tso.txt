Ching-tso, (Chinese: “quiet sitting”) , Pinyin jingzuo,  meditation technique associated with Neo-Confucianism. Influenced by both Taoist and Ch’an (Zen) Buddhist forms of meditation, it involves sitting in a relaxed fashion with the intent of quieting the flow of discursive thought and the attainment of the original goodness of human nature (the condition of Confucian sagehood).
