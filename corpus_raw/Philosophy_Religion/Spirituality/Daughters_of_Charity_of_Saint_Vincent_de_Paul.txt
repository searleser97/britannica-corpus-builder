Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul,  Roman Catholic religious congregation founded at Paris in 1633 by St. Vincent de Paul and St. Louise de Marillac. The congregation was a radical innovation by 17th-century standards: it was the first noncloistered religious institute of women devoted to active charitable works, especially in the service of the poor.
St. Vincent originally established in Paris and in nearly every place where he worked congregations of charity among the wealthy women who wished to help the poor. Eventually, peasant girls were gathered to assist the Ladies of Charity, and they were entrusted to the care of St. Louise de Marillac. This group developed into the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul. At first dedicated to nursing the poor in their homes, the sisters almost immediately undertook the teaching of poor children and the running of hospitals, and gradually they became involved in every form of charitable work. Their services during various wars in many countries earned them the title Angels of the Battlefield. Their provinces all over the world are subject to the motherhouse in Paris, which is under the supervision of the superior general of the Congregation of the Mission, or Vincentians.
