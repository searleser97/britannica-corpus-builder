Qalandarīyah,   loosely organized group of wandering Muslim dervishes who form an “irregular” (bī-sharʿ) or antinomian Ṣūfī mystical order. The Qalandarīyah seem to have arisen from the earlier Malāmatīyah in Central Asia and exhibited Buddhist and perhaps Hindu influences. The adherents of the order were notorious for their contempt for the norms of Muslim society, their use of drugs, and their coarse behaviour. They shaved their heads, faces, and eyebrows, dressed only in blankets or in hip-length hairshirts, led a wandering, nomadic life, and regarded all acts as lawful.
The movement is first mentioned in Khorāsān in the 11th century; from there it spread to India, Syria, and western Iran. The Qalandarīyah were responsible for several uprisings in the Ottoman Empire prior to the 16th century.
