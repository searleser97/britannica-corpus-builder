Shaṭḥ, plural Shaṭaḥat,  in Ṣūfī Islām, divinely inspired statements that Ṣūfīs utter in their mystical state of fana (passing away of the self). The Ṣūfīs claim that there are moments of ecstatic fervour when they are overwhelmed by the divine presence to such a degree that they lose touch with worldly realities. In such moments they utter statements that may seem incoherent or blasphemous if taken literally but are perfectly understood by fellow Ṣūfīs who have shared the same experiences. Shaṭaḥāt, Ṣūfīs warn, must be interpreted allegorically.
Muslim legalists naturally tended to brand as heresy all Ṣūfī shaṭaḥāt that did not conform to Islāmic teachings, and many Ṣūfīs suffered persecution on this account. The mystic al-Ḥallāj, for example, was persecuted and finally executed for his famous cry, “I am the Truth.” Since “the Truth” is one of the names of God, legalists interpreted the utterance as a blasphemous claim to divinity. Ṣūfī defenders of al-Ḥallāj argued that in his mystical state he found himself in union with God.
Since the state of mystical trance is normally of short duration, shaṭaḥāt rarely exceed six or seven words. The Ṣūfīs, however, regard all their writings, and particularly their poetry, as possessing an element of shaṭḥ. For this reason it also must be interpreted allegorically. Among often quoted shaṭaḥāt are:
“For the perfect lover, prayer becomes impiety” (al-Ḥallāj).
“Praise be to me. How great is my majesty!” (Bāyazīd al-Besṭāmī, d. 874).
“I am the proof of God.” “Divine omnipotence has a secret; if it is revealed there is an end of the prophetic mission” (Ibn Sahl at-Tustarī, d. 896).
“Ritual acts are only impurities” (ash-Shiblī, d. 945).
“In my robe there is only God” (Ibn Abī al-Khayr, d. 1048).
“The slave is the Lord and the Lord is the slave; how can one tell which of the two is the debtor?” (Ibn al-ʿArabi, d. 1240).
