Ravidas, also called Raidas,  (flourished 15th or 16th century), mystic and poet who was one of the most renowned of the saints of the North Indian bhakti movement.
Ravidas was born in Varanasi as a member of an untouchable leather-working caste, and his poems and songs often revolve around his low social position. While objecting to the notion that caste plays a fundamental role in an individual’s relationship to God, Ravidas contrasted his own lowliness to the exalted place of the divine: God, he said, was finer than he, as silk was to a worm, and more fragrant than he, as sandalwood was to the stinking castor oil plant. In relation to God, all persons, no matter what their castes, are “untouchables,” and “A family that has a true follower of the Lord is neither high caste nor low caste, lordly nor poor.” Ravidas’s charisma and reputation were such that Brahmans (members of the priestly class) were said to have bowed before him.
Some 40 of the poems attributed to Ravidas were included in the Adi Granth (“First Volume”), the sacred scripture of Sikhism, and it is generally accepted that Ravidas met Nanak, the first Guru and founder of the Sikh tradition. In the 19th and 20th centuries a new religious movement formed around his figure. A temple was built in his hometown, where he was worshipped; his hymns were recited every morning and night; and his birthday was celebrated as a religious event. His egalitarian teachings made him a figure of veneration and pride among various scheduled classes, or Dalit (as untouchables are now known), social-reform movements of the 20th century.
