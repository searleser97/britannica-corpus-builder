Demon, also spelled daemon, Classical Greek daimon,  in Greek religion, a supernatural power. In Homer the term is used almost interchangeably with theos for a god. The distinction there is that theos emphasizes the personality of the god, and demon his activity. Hence, the term demon was regularly applied to sudden or unexpected supernatural interventions not due to any particular deity. It became commonly the power determining a personâ€™s fate, and a mortal could have a personal demon. As early as Hesiod (c. 700 bc), the dead of the Golden Age became demons; and later philosophical speculation envisaged these as lower than the gods (possibly mortal) but as superior to humanity. (See also angel and demon.)
