Automatism,   in spiritualism, the spontaneous performance of certain physical acts without the conscious control of the agent. In automatism a message is purportedly conveyed, usually through a spiritualist medium speaking in a trance during a séance (French: “sitting”), through automatic writing or through a joint experiment involving several persons (e.g., using a Ouija board). Though the message may appear to come from the spirit world, spiritualists concede that automatism may be the result of subliminal thoughts or feelings that are released and given free expression in certain favourable situations. See also automatic writing; medium; Ouija board; séance.
