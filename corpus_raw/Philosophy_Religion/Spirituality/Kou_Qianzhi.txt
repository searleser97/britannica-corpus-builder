Kou Qianzhi, Wade-Giles K’ou Ch’ien-chih,  (died 448 ce, China),  Daoist religious leader who organized many of the ceremonies and rites of the Tianshidao (“Way of the Celestial Masters”) movement and reformulated its theology. His influence was such that he had Daoism established as the official state religion of the Northern Wei dynasty (386–534/535); this act, however, embroiled Daoism in long and often bloody factional political struggles.
Kou apparently began his career as a Daoist physician and hygienist. But in 415 he had a vision: a spirit appeared before him and told him that since the death of Zhang Ling (34?–156), the great founder of the Tianshidao, the movement had been perverted by false doctrines. Kou was awarded Zhang Ling’s old title of tianshi (“celestial master”) and was charged in the vision with eliminating excesses in Daoist rituals. Accordingly, Kou began to attempt to curb the orgiastic practices and mercenary spirit that had become associated with Daoist rites and to place greater emphasis on hygienic ritual and good works.
Kou gained many adherents and, by making Daoism into a more orthodox doctrine, attracted the attention of Emperor Taiwudi (reigned 423–452). In 423 Kou had the title of tianshi conferred upon himself by imperial decree: the title was passed to the movement’s leader from generation to generation in an unbroken line. By conspiring with certain court officials, Kou was able to have Buddhism, Daoism’s chief competitor, proscribed from the realm and all its practitioners subjected to a bloody persecution. Daoism then became the official religion of the empire.
But Kou’s efforts were only temporarily effective: Buddhism soon returned to China, stronger than ever. Moreover, because orgiastic Daoist rites were still noted as late as the Tang dynasty (618–907), many observers view his reforms as transitory.
