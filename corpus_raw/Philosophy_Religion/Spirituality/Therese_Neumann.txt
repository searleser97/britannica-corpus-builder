Therese Neumann,  (born 1898, Konnersreuth, Bavaria—died September 18, 1962, Konnersreuth), German stigmatic.
At the age of 20 Neumann underwent a severe nervous shock after the outbreak of a fire and later suffered from hysterical paralysis, blindness, and gastric troubles for several years. In 1926 a blood-coloured serum began to ooze from her eyes, and during Lent of the same year the stigmata (wounds resembling those of Christ in hands, feet, and side) appeared. Throughout the next 30 years these continued to bleed on many Fridays, especially during the last two weeks of Lent, and were accompanied by trances and other striking phenomena that attracted many visitors. Following her stigmatization, Therese claimed to live without food or drink, being sustained only by Holy Communion. At the request of her bishop she was subjected to a fortnight’s investigation in 1927. Later the church authorities recognized this to have been inconclusive, as hysterical subjects are known to be able to sustain a complete fast for more than three weeks; in 1932 and 1937 she was requested to submit to another examination but refused, alleging that her father forbade her to do so. Hence her bishop issued no more permits for visits to her, which nevertheless reached a new peak in the years after World War II, when U.S. soldiers and others came to Konnersreuth in large numbers. After 1950 the Passion ecstasies became much less frequent, though she continued to be visited by thousands each year until her death. The controversy about the supernatural or purely neurotic origin of the phenomena continues.
