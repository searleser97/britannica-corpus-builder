Walter William Skeat,  (born Oct. 14, 1866, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, Eng.—died  July 24, 1953, London), British ethnographer of the Malay Peninsula whose detailed works laid the foundation for later ethnographic studies of the area.
Following a classical education at Christ’s College, Cambridge, Skeat in 1891 joined the civil service of the state of Selangor in the Malay Peninsula. He became interested in ideas of magic found among Malays and in the customary practices and daily life of the aborigines living in the interior.
During 1899 he carried out an expedition to Trengganu (Terengganu) and Kelantan, Malay states then under Siamese suzerainty, to collect data on Malay beliefs, traditions, and ways of life in areas not yet subjected to European influence. Illness contracted on this trip forced him to resign from the colonial service, and he spent the remainder of his life in London, serving as one of the Studeley lecturers at the British Museum from 1914 until his retirement in 1932.
His research led to the publication of two major works: Malay Magic (1900) and Pagan Races of the Malay Peninsula (1906, with C.O. Blagden).
