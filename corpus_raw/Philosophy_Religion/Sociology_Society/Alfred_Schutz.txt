Alfred Schutz,  (born April 13, 1899, Vienna, Austria—died May 20, 1959, New York, N.Y., U.S.), Austrian-born U.S. sociologist and philosopher who developed a social science based on phenomenology. He emigrated to the U.S. in 1939, teaching at the New School for Social Research in New York (1943–59). He drew attention to the social presuppositions underlying everyday life and to the creation of social reality through symbols and human action. His work laid the basis for the field of ethnomethodology, the study of people’s commonsense understandings of the structure of social interaction. His principal work is The Phenomenology of the Social World (1932). See also interactionism.
