W.J. Perry, in full William James Perry,  (born 1868â€”died  1949), British geographer and anthropologist noted for his diffusionist theory of cultural development. Perry believed that Egypt of 4000 bc was the original and sole source of agriculture, pottery, basketry, domestic animals, houses, and towns and that these then spread throughout the world. He explained all cultural differences and similarities by migrations and additions, losses, and combinations of complexes of cultural traits, views that are considered naive by contemporary anthropologists.
