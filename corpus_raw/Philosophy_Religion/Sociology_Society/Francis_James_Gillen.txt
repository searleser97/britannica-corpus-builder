Francis James Gillen,  (born Oct. 28, 1855, Clare, near Adelaide, S.Aus., Australia—died  June 5, 1912), Australian anthropologist who did pioneering fieldwork among the Aborigines of central Australia.
Gillen’s training in anthropology came not from a university but from close contact with Aborigines in his work for the Australian postal and telegraph service. He made independent studies of Aborigines, learning their languages and customs, and became especially sensitive to their feelings, trying to deal with them fairly and with understanding. The Australian government ultimately appointed him a magistrate and subprotector of Aborigines.
In 1894 Gillen met the English anthropologist Baldwin Spencer, who was traveling with the Horn Scientific Expedition through central Australia. Gillen and Spencer soon became friends and began to collaborate on Aboriginal studies. Their association extended over a period of many years and resulted in the publication of several coauthored works. Gillen’s remarkable collection of photographs of Aboriginal life is now the property of the South Australian government.
