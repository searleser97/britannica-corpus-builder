Robert R. Marett, in full Robert Ranulph Marett,  (born June 13, 1866, Jersey, Channel Islands—died  Feb. 18, 1943), English social anthropologist who, like Sir James George Frazer and Andrew Lang, came to anthropology with a strong background in classical literature and philosophy. Marett is best-known for his studies of the evolution of moral philosophy and religious beliefs and practices.
He studied at Victoria College in Jersey and Balliol College, Oxford, and, from 1891 until his death, held positions at Exeter College, Oxford, as a fellow, tutor of philosophy, examiner in literae humaniores, and rector. From 1910 to 1936 he was a reader in social anthropology.
Marett’s views on primitive religion differed somewhat from those of Frazer and Sir Edward Burnett Tylor, generally acknowledged as the greatest anthropologists of his day; Marett opposed their rigid, rational categorizations and spoke of early man’s “primitive logic of the heart.” As opposed to Tylor’s “animism,” he postulated an impersonal religion, or “animatism,” based on “awe,” a feeling of “submissiveness tempered with admiration, hopefulness, and even love.”
Marett’s unusually broad intellectual accomplishments ranged from Plato’s Republic, about which he gave a famous series of lectures (published as Anthropology and the Classics, 1908, reissued 1967), to prehistoric archaeology. He was gifted with a lucid writing style with which he was able to propagate the field of anthropology. In 1909 he helped found the Oxford University Anthropological Society. His major publications include: The Threshold of Religion (1900), Anthropology (1912), Psychology and Folklore (1920), Faith, Hope and Charity in Primitive Religion (1932), Sacraments of Simple Folk (1933), and Head, Heart and Hands in Human Evolution (1935).
