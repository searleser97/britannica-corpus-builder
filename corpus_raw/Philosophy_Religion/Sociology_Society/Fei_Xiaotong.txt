Fei Xiaotong, Wade-Giles romanization Fei Hsiao-t’ung,  (born November 2, 1910, Wujiang district, Jiangsu province, China—died April 24, 2005, Beijing), one of the foremost Chinese social anthropologists, noted for his studies of village life in China.
Fei graduated in 1933 from Yanjing University in Beijing and did graduate work at Qinghua University (also in Beijing) and the London School of Economics. In 1945 he became professor of anthropology at Qinghua but was forced to move to England the following year because of his opposition to Chiang Kai-shek’s government. He eventually returned to China, and in 1949 he was made deputy dean at Qinghua. Following the rise to power of the Chinese Communist Party and Mao Zedong, however, the field of sociology was banned. Fei became a victim of the antirightist campaign in 1957 and later the Cultural Revolution (1966–76), but he resurfaced in 1978, when he was rehabilitated. He was made a professor and the director of the Institute of Sociology of Peking University and chairman of the Chinese Democratic League.
Fei first undertook fieldwork in 1935, studying the Yao in Guangxi province. His work ended in disaster, however, when he was injured by a tiger trap and his wife drowned while trying to help him. After recuperating, he turned his attention to peasants, making particular note of their economic situation. His findings formed the basis for the seminal book Peasant Life in China (1939), which was originally written in English. Fei continued to conduct research on anthropology and sociology, although the political situation in China often hindered his work. A translation of one of his classic texts, Xiang tu zhongguo (1947), was published as From the Soil: The Foundations of Chinese Society (1992). Among Fei’s other books originally written in English are China’s Gentry (1953), Chinese Village Close-up (1983), and Small Towns in China (1986).
