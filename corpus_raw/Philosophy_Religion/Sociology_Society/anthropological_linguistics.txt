Anthropological linguistics,   study of the relationship between language and culture; it usually refers to work on languages that have no written records. In the United States a close relationship between anthropology and linguistics developed as a result of research by anthropologists into the American Indian cultures and languages. Early students in this field discovered what they felt to be significant relationships between the languages, thought, and cultures of the Indian groups. The issue of the relatedness of language and culture is still a controversial one, and it is now thought by many scholars that the relationship is not as close as was first suspected. Anthropologists currently draw on linguistic techniques primarily for the analysis of such areas as kinship systems, botanical taxonomies, and colour terms, but a number of anthropologists are still engaged in fieldwork centring on language description.
