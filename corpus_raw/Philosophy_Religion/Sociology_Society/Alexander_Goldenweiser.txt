Alexander Goldenweiser, in full Alexander Alexandrovich Goldenweiser,  (born January 29 [January 17, Old Style], 1880, Kiev, Ukraine, Russian Empireâ€”died July 6, 1940, Portland, Oregon, U.S.), American anthropologist whose analyses of cultural questions ranged widely, encompassing intellectual movements in psychology and psychoanalysis. In particular, he suggested that cultural diffusion is not a mechanical process but, rather, depends in part on the receptiveness of cultures to proffered traits.
Goldenweiser studied under anthropologist Franz Boas at Columbia University, where he took a Ph.D. in 1910 and then taught until 1919. A brilliant lecturer, he held subsequent posts at the New School for Social Research, New York City; the University of Oregon, Eugene; and Reed College, Portland. Though he did field work among the Iroquois Indians of North America, he addressed himself mainly to theoretical considerations. Convinced that totemism is founded on a symbolic mystical relationship, he stressed psychological factors common to different tribal cultures but concluded that there is no single, distinct class of totemic practices. He regarded the conceptual worlds of nonliterate peoples as not fundamentally different from the world of modern man and was interested in theoretical and applied primitive science. One of the first U.S. textbooks in anthropology was his Early Civilization (1922; rev. ed. Anthropology, 1937). He also wrote History, Psychology, and Culture (1933).
