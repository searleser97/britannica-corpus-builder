E.E. Evans-Pritchard, in full Sir Edward Evan Evans-Pritchard,  (born September 21, 1902, Crowborough, Sussex, England—died September 11, 1973, Oxford, Oxfordshire), one of England’s foremost social anthropologists, especially known for his investigations of African cultures, for his exploration of segmentary systems, and for his explanations of witchcraft and magic.
After studying modern history at the University of Oxford, Evans-Pritchard did postgraduate work in anthropology at the London School of Economics and Political Science. He then did fieldwork among the Zande and Nuer of what is now South Sudan. Two books about these peoples, Witchcraft, Oracles, and Magic Among the Azande (1937) and The Nuer (1940), made his reputation. In 1940 he and Meyer Fortes edited a volume of essays, African Political Systems, that revolutionized the comparative study of governments.
Although Evans-Pritchard was throughout his life a prolific writer, especially on kinship, religion, and the history of anthropology, his later writings were eclipsed by his earlier work. His later writings were often theoretical essays and lectures on the relations between anthropology and other social sciences. These revealed a great depth of scholarship but were often controversial and divergent from the trends of the time. However, his influence as a teacher in the latter part of his life was considerable, for under his guidance the Oxford school of social anthropology attracted students from many parts of the world; and he sponsored fieldwork in Africa and elsewhere as a member of the Colonial Social Science Research Council.
Evans-Pritchard received numerous academic honours. He was a professor of social anthropology at Oxford and a fellow of All Souls College from 1946 to 1970, and he was subwarden from 1963 to 1965. He was knighted in 1971.
