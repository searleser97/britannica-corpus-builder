Henri Alexandre Junod,  (born 1863, Neuchâtel canton, Switz.—died  1934, Geneva), Swiss Protestant missionary and anthropologist noted for his ethnography of the Tsonga (Thonga) peoples of southern Africa.
During Junod’s first assignment in the Transvaal (1889–96), in addition to carrying out his missionary office, he collected plant, butterfly, and insect specimens, some named for him, that were sent to museums in Switzerland and South Africa. His interest, however, shifted to ethnographic observation and linguistic study, and he prepared a grammar and analysis of Ronga, a Tsonga dialect (1896), a collection of Ronga folk songs and tales (1897), and a Ronga ethnography (1898).
Subsequent tours of duty (1899–1903 and 1904–09) resulted in a grammar of Tsonga-Shangaan (1907); a study of morals, Zidgig (1911); and the work on which his fame rests, translated into English as The Life of a South African Tribe (2 vol., 1912, 1913). Junod’s work vividly presented customs in relation to the dynamics and trends of the society. It was his conviction that for an ethnography to be scientific, it must be limited to observation of a single tribe in a single geographic area.
Following his last stay in Africa (1913–20), Junod spent the remainder of his life with the Mission Romande, Geneva, and worked on his African materials. The second edition of his great work (1927) provided a pioneer functional analysis of a culture.
