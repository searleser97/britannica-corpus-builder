George P. Murdock, in full George Peter Murdock,  (born May 11, 1897, Meriden, Conn., U.S.—died  March 29, 1985, Devon, Pa.), American anthropologist who specialized in comparative ethnology, the ethnography of African and Oceanic peoples, and social theory. He is perhaps most notable as the originator, in 1937, of the Cross-Cultural Survey, a project of the Institute of Human Relations of Yale University, in which a vast amount of anthropological data was cataloged so that any known aspect of a society’s culture could be quickly summoned from a data bank.
Murdock studied history at Yale, receiving his B.A. in 1919 and Ph.D. in 1925, and taught there from 1928 to 1960. From 1960 to 1973 he was Mellon professor of anthropology at the University of Pittsburgh (emeritus thereafter).
Murdock’s anthropological work was influenced by several other disciplines in the social sciences, especially linguistics, sociology, behavioral psychology, and psychoanalysis. His works include Our Primitive Contemporaries (1934), Ethnographic Bibliography of North America (1941; rev. ed. 1975), Social Structure (1949), and Outline of World Cultures (1954). The reference work Ethnographic Atlas (1967) is considered to be his chief work.
Murdock served as president of the Ethnological Society and the American Anthropological Association. In 1962 he established the international journal Ethnology, which he edited until he retired.
