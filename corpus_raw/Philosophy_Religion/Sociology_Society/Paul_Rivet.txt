Paul Rivet,  (born 1876, Wassigny, Fr.—died  March 25, 1958, Paris), French ethnologist who suggested Australian and Melanesian origins for the Indians of South America and who founded (1937) a major anthropological museum, the Museum of Man (Musée de l’Homme), Paris.
Educated as a physician, Rivet joined a scientific expedition sent to Ecuador in 1901. At the end of the mission, he remained in South America an additional six years, observing the peoples of the high Andean valleys.
Returning to Paris, Rivet became an assistant at the National Museum of Natural History, classifying his South American materials and publishing, with museum director René Verneau, Ethnographie ancienne de l’Équateur, 2 parts (1912–22; “Ancient Ethnography of Ecuador”). In 1926 he helped to establish the Institute of Ethnology at the University of Paris, where he was instrumental in training many ethnologists. In 1928 he succeeded Verneau as museum director.
Rivet theorized that Asia was not the sole place of origin of the early Americans and that there had been migrations from Australia about 6,000 years ago and from Melanesia sometime later. His book Les Origines de l’homme américain (1943; “The Origins of American Man”) contained linguistic and anthropological evidence supporting his migration thesis.
In 1942 Rivet went to Colombia, founding an ethnological institute and a museum there. In 1945 he returned to his Paris museum and teaching posts and continued his South American research. His linguistic work presented much data on languages otherwise little known, notably the Aymaran and Quechuan languages of South America.
