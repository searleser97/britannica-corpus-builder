Patrick Joseph Hayes,  (born Nov. 20, 1867, New York, N.Y., U.S.—died  Sept. 4, 1938, Monticello, N.Y.), archbishop of New York and cardinal who unified Roman Catholic welfare activities under a central agency, Catholic Charities.
After graduate study at the Catholic University of America, Washington, D.C., Hayes went to New York City as curate at St. Gabriel’s parish, becoming successively secretary (1895) to Bishop John Farley, chancellor of the archdiocese (1903), first president (1903) of Cathedral College (the archdiocesan preparatory seminary, New York City), and bishop auxiliary to the then Cardinal Farley (1914). During World War I, he was first bishop of the armed forces (1917), in charge of all Roman Catholic chaplains in the army and navy. On March 10, 1919, he became the fifth archbishop of New York, and he created Catholic Charities (1920), an organization that became a model for other American dioceses. Pope Pius XI named him cardinal in 1924.
