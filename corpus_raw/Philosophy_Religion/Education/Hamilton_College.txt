Hamilton College, named for statesman Alexander Hamilton, traces its history to 1793, when missionary Samuel Kirkland founded the Hamilton-Oneida Academy. The academy was meant to bring the children of the Oneida people and of white settlers together in an environment of learning and cooperation. Though only a small number of Oneidas enrolled, the academy lasted for 18 years. In 1812 the school was chartered as Hamilton College, the third institution of higher education established in the state of New York. An all-male school, Hamilton College opened a school for women, Kirkland College, in 1968. Classes of both colleges were open to all students, and the two schools formally merged in 1978. Notable alumni include physician and sex researcher William Masters, statesman Elihu Root, and poet Ezra Pound.
