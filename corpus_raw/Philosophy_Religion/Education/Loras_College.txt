In 1934 it began offering courses in graduate study through a midwestern branch of the Catholic University of America. Graduate education under Loras’ direction emerged after Catholic University ended its affiliation with the college in 1963. The college went through a series of name changes until finally settling on Loras College in 1939. Women were first admitted in 1971. In 1969 Loras joined Clarke College and the University of Dubuque to form the Tri-College Cooperative Effort, which promotes sharing curriculum and faculty.
