Franklin and Marshall was one of the first school of higher education founded in the state. Franklin College, established in 1787, was named for Benjamin Franklin, one of the school’s original benefactors. Marshall College, named for U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall, was founded in 1835 in Mercersburg, Pennsylvania. The two schools merged in 1853. Although women were members of Franklin College’s first class, the school thereafter was limited to men, as were Marshall College and the combined school. Women were admitted in 1969.
