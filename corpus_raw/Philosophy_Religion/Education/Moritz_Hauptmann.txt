Moritz Hauptmann,  (born Oct. 13, 1792, Dresden, Saxony [Germany]—died  Jan. 3, 1868, Leipzig), German violinist, composer, teacher, and writer on musical theory.
Hauptmann studied music under various masters of the time and afterward completed his education as a violinist and composer under Louis Spohr. Until 1820 Hauptmann held various appointments in private courts and families, varying his musical occupations with mathematical and other studies bearing chiefly on acoustics and related subjects. For a time, also, he was employed as an architect, but all other pursuits gave place to music.
In 1822 Hauptmann entered the orchestra of the city of Kassel, again under Spohr’s direction, and taught composition and musical theory. His compositions at this time consisted chiefly of motets, masses, cantatas, and songs. His tragic grand opera Mathilde was produced in 1826.
In 1842 Hauptmann became cantor at the Thomas School (Thomasschule) of Leipzig, where one of his predecessors had been Johann Sebastian Bach, and the following year he became a professor at the newly founded Leipzig Conservatory. There his gift as a teacher developed and was acknowledged by a crowd of enthusiastic pupils, among whom were Joseph Joachim, Hans von Bülow, Arthur Sullivan, and Frederic Hymen Cowen. In 1850, with Otto Jahn and Robert Schumann, Hauptmann founded the Bach-Gesellschaft (“Bach Society”); for the remainder of his life he served as the society’s president and edited the first three volumes of the Bach-Gesellschaft (BG) edition of Bach’s complete works. His most important publication in the area of theory was Die Natur der Harmonik und Metrik (1853; The Nature of Harmony and Metric).
