Boyd H. Bode, in full Boyd Henry Bode,  (born Oct. 4, 1873, Ridott, Ill., U.S.—died  March 29, 1953, Gainesville, Fla.), American educational philosopher noted for his pragmatic approach.
Bode was raised in farm communities in Iowa and South Dakota and educated at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor (A.B., 1897) and at Cornell University, Ithaca, N.Y. (Ph.D., 1900). He taught philosophy at the University of Wisconsin in Madison (1900–09) and the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign (1909–21).
In 1921 Bode became professor of education at Ohio State University in Columbus, where he remained until 1945. During that time he also taught occasionally at the Graduate Institute for Education in Cairo and other institutions. In 1946 he accepted the position of graduate lecturer in philosophy at the University of Florida, and he conducted weekly seminars at his Gainesville home until shortly before his death at the age of 79.
Bode’s pragmatic approach to educational philosophy resembled that of John Dewey. He wrote several books explaining his ideas—An Outline of Logic (1910), Fundamentals of Education (1921), Modern Educational Theories (1927), Conflicting Psychologies of Learning (1929), Democracy as a Way of Life (1937), Progressive Education at the Crossroads (1938), and How We Learn (1940).
