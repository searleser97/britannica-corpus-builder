Andrew Greeley, in full Andrew Moran Greeley,  (born February 5, 1928, Oak Park, Illinois, U.S.—died May 29, 2013, Chicago, Illinois), American Roman Catholic priest, sociologist, educator, commentator, and prolific author who devoted more than 50 years to addressing the teachings of the Catholic faith through nonfiction works and newspaper articles, as well as television and radio broadcasts. He was also a popular novelist, publishing more than 50 best-selling novels.
After receiving his Licentiate of Sacred Theology (S.T.L.; 1954) from Saint Mary of the Lake Seminary (now the University of Saint Mary of the Lake Seminary), Mundelein, Illinois, Greeley served in Chicago as an assistant pastor (1954–64) at Christ the King parish. He continued his education at the University of Chicago, where he earned an M.A. (1961) and a Ph.D. (1962). He then held a number of posts there, including lecturer in sociology of religion (1963–72), senior study director of the National Opinion Research Center (NORC; 1961–68), and program director for higher education at NORC (1968–70). In 1985 he became a research associate at NORC’s Center for the Study of Politics and Society. Greeley also taught at the University of Illinois, Chicago, and at the University of Arizona.
Greeley’s steadfast, liberal-leaning perspective on the place of the Roman Catholic Church in daily life was often met with criticism by church traditionalists. Suggesting that the church should accommodate the growing needs of its members worldwide, he supported such issues as the ordination of women, more lenient policies on birth control and divorce, and a more democratic method for choosing the pope. His more conventional viewpoints included the belief that priests could better serve the church by remaining celibate. He wrote several books on Catholic theological and church issues, including The Making of the Popes 1978: The Politics of Intrigue in the Vatican (1979), The Catholic Revolution: New Wine, Old Wineskins, and the Second Vatican Council (2004), and The Making of the Pope 2005, a study of the election that year of Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger as Pope Benedict XVI.
A prolific writer, Greeley published widely and in various media. His sociological studies include Unsecular Man: The Persistence of Religion (1972), Priests: A Calling in Crisis (2004), and The Truth about Conservative Christians: What They Think and What They Believe (2006, with Michael Hout). He wrote a weekly newspaper column for the Chicago Sun-Times, contributed to such publications as The New York Times and the National Catholic Reporter, and was a popular guest on radio and television talk shows, where he showcased his humour and tackled controversial theological issues of the day.
Greeley’s best sellers include novels in the popular Nuala Anne McGrail mystery series, which began with Irish Gold (1994) and continued with such works as Irish Tiger (2008) and Irish Tweed (2009). Another successful series of novels, featuring Father (later Bishop and then Archbishop) Blackie Ryan, includes Happy Are the Meek (1985), The Bishop Goes to the University (2003), and The Archbishop in Andalusia (2008). Among Greeley’s other works are The Priestly Sins (2004) and Home for Christmas (2009). In October 2008 Greeley suffered a severe head injury that resulted in his hospitalization for several months. In 2010 Chicago Catholics and the Struggles Within Their Church, a study that Greeley had nearly finished by late 2007, was completed and published by his colleagues at NORC.
