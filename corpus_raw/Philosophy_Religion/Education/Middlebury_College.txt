Middlebury College was founded in 1800 and initially was intended to train men for the ministry and other learned professions. Alexander Twilight became the first black man to earn a baccalaureate in the United States when he graduated from the college in 1823. Twenty-one years earlier Middlebury had awarded an honorary degree to black clergyman Lemuel Haynes. Women were first admitted in 1883.
