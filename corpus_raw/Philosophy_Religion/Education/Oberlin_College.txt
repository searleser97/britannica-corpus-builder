Oberlin College,  private coeducational institution of higher learning at Oberlin, Ohio, offering programs in liberal arts and music. It was founded by Presbyterian minister John J. Shipherd and Philo P. Stewart in 1833 as the Oberlin Collegiate Institute to educate ministers and schoolteachers for the West. It was named for the Alsatian pastor Johann Friedrich Oberlin and was designated a college in 1850. The institution was coeducational from its beginning, and it was the first college in the United States to adopt this policy. Oberlin also admitted blacks on an equal footing with whites, and it, along with the town, became a station on the Underground Railroad by which fugitive slaves escaped to freedom in Canada. Charles Grandison Finney, the collegeâ€™s president from 1851 to 1866, was a well-known evangelist. Charles Martin Hall, an alumnus who had in 1886 developed an inexpensive method of making aluminum commercially, bequeathed to the college a large endowment and the funds to construct Hall Auditorium.
Oberlin now consists of a college of arts and sciences and the Oberlin Conservatory of Music (1865), which is one of the oldest professional music schools in the United States. Notable alumni of the school include Nobel Prize-winning physicist Robert Andrews Millikan, educator Junius L. Meriam, and ethnologist Frances Densmore.
