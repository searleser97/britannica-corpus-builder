Manchester University, formerly (1889–2012) Manchester College,  private coeducational institution of higher learning in North Manchester, Indiana, U.S. It is a university of liberal arts and sciences that grants baccalaureate degrees in more than 40 areas of study, as well as several associate of arts degrees and master’s degrees. The school, which is religiously affiliated with the Church of the Brethren, is known for its Peace Studies Institute and Program in Conflict Resolution. Established in 1948, it was the first peace-studies program in the United States and is the only such program to hold the status of a nongovernmental organization within the United Nations (UN). The university’s environmental-studies program, founded in 1971, was also among the earliest of its kind. Total student enrollment is about 1,200.
Manchester University has its origins in the Roanoke Classical Seminary, which was founded in Roanoke, Indiana, in 1860. It came under the auspices of the German Baptist Brethren Church in 1878 and adopted the name Manchester College after it was relocated to North Manchester in 1889. In the first decades of the 20th century, the institution evolved from an academy and Bible school to a liberal arts college. Another Brethren-owned school, Mount Morris College in Mount Morris, Illinois, merged with Manchester College in 1932. In 2012 Manchester College was renamed Manchester University. Notable alumni include chemists Paul J. Flory and Roy Plunkett, UN official Andrew Cordier, and Dan West, founder of charitable organization Heifer International.
