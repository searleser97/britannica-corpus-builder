Theodore Parker,  (born August 24, 1810, Lexington, Massachusetts, U.S.—died  May 10, 1860, Florence, Italy), American Unitarian theologian, pastor, scholar, and social reformer who was active in the antislavery movement. Theologically, he repudiated much traditional Christian dogma, putting in its place an intuitive knowledge of God derived from man’s experience of nature and insight into his own mind. Parker resembled Ralph Waldo Emerson and other New England Transcendentalists in his emphasis on intuition but differed in the way he tempered his romanticism with rationalist and scientific interest.
Although Parker passed the entrance examination for Harvard College in 1830, he had no funds to attend. He was allowed, however, to take the examinations for his course of study without enrolling and was granted an honorary degree. He then attended Harvard Divinity School, from which he graduated in 1836. The next year he was ordained pastor of the Unitarian Church in West Roxbury, Massachusetts.
By 1841 Parker had formulated his liberal religious views and had incorporated them in the sermon “The Transient and Permanent in Christianity.” The transient, to him, was Christianity’s theological and scriptural dogma, and the permanent was its moral truths. He elaborated his views in lectures published as A Discourse of Matters Pertaining to Religion. Opposition to his liberalism increased, and he soon resigned his pastorate. His supporters founded the 28th Congregational Society of Boston and installed him as minister.
Parker worked for prison reform, temperance, women’s education, and other such causes. He made impassioned speeches against slavery, helped fugitive slaves to escape, and wrote an abolitionist tract, A Letter to the People of the United States Touching the Matter of Slavery (1848). He also served on the secret committee that aided the abolitionist John Brown.
