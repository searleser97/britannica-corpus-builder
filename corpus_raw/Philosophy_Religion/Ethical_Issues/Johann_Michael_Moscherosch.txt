Johann Michael Moscherosch, pseudonym Philander Von Sittewald,  (born March 5, 1601, Willstädt, near Strassburg [now in Germany]—died  April 4, 1669, Worms), German Lutheran satirist whose bitterly brilliant but partisan writings graphically describe life in a Germany ravaged by the Thirty Years’ War (1618–48). His satires, which at times are tedious, also show an overwhelming moral zeal added to a sense of mission.
Moscherosch was educated at Strassburg (now Strasbourg) and was for some years tutor in the family of the Count of Leiningen-Dagsburg. He held various government offices, including those of president of the chancellery and counselor to the chamber of finances (1656) to the Count of Hanau and privy councillor to the Countess of Hesse-Kassel.
Moscherosch’s most famous work, Wunderliche und wahrhafftige Gesichte Philanders von Sittewald (1641–43; “Peculiar and True Visions of Philander von Sittewald”), displays his satirical ability. Modeled on Los sueños (1627; “Dreams”) of Francisco de Quevedo y Villegas, it lampoons the customs and culture of the Germany of his day from the standpoint of a staunch Lutheran patriot. Another work is the Insomnis Cura Parentum (1643), a religious tract addressed to his family that reflects his strict Lutheran piety. Moscherosch was also a member of the Fruchtbringende Gesellschaft (“Productive Society”), which was founded for the purification of the German language and the fostering of German literature.
