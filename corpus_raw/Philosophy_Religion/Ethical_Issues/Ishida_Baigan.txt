Ishida Baigan,  (born Oct. 12, 1685, Tamba Province, Japan—died  Oct. 29, 1744, Kyōto), Japanese scholar who originated the moral-education movement called Shingaku (“Heart Learning”), which sought to popularize ethics among the common people.
The son of a farmer, Ishida began studying ethical doctrines in Kyōto as a young man while apprenticed to a merchant house. In 1729 he launched the Shingaku movement with lectures in his home. Confucianism supplied the fundamental ethics, but Ishida also incorporated Daoist, Buddhist, and Shintō elements. Explaining moral education in simple terms, Ishida used many parables in speaking directly to the people. He toured the country lecturing and in 1739 published Tohi mondō (“Question and Answer Between City and Countryside”).
Some 400 disciples carried on the movement after Ishida’s death, and Shingaku grew, partly with government encouragement, until it had 81 schools all over Japan. As the teaching became more dogmatic and stereotyped, however, it declined in popularity, and by the end of the Tokugawa period in 1867 the movement was in a final decline. Ishida’s works include Seika ron (1774), an essay on family government espousing the Confucian view that a man who cannot govern his family cannot govern a nation. His disciples published Ishida sensei goroku (“The Sayings of Professor Ishida”) in 1806.
