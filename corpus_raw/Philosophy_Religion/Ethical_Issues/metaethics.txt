Metaethics,  the subdiscipline of ethics concerned with the nature of ethical theories and moral judgments.
A brief treatment of metaethics follows. For further discussion, see ethics: Metaethics.
Major metaethical theories include naturalism, nonnaturalism (or intuitionism), emotivism, and prescriptivism. Naturalists and nonnaturalists agree that moral language is cognitiveâ€”i.e., that moral claims can be known to be true or false. They disagree, however, on how this knowing is to be done. Naturalists hold either that these claims can be adequately justified by reasoning from statements employing only nonmoral terms or that moral terms themselves can be defined in nonmoral (natural or factlike) terms. Intuitionists deny both of these positions and hold that moral terms are sui generis, that moral statements are autonomous in their logical status. Emotivists deny that moral utterances are cognitive, holding that they consist in emotional expressions of approval or disapproval and that the nature of moral reasoning and justification must be reinterpreted to take this essential characteristic of moral utterances into account. Prescriptivists take a somewhat similar approach, arguing that moral judgments are prescriptions or prohibitions of action, rather than statements of fact about the world.
