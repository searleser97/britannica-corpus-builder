Ariston Of Chios, Ariston also spelled Aristo,  (flourished 3rd century bc), Greek philosopher who studied under Zeno, the founder of the Stoic school of philosophy; he combined Stoic and Cynic ideas in shaping his own beliefs. Ariston believed that the only topic of genuine value in philosophy is the study of ethics and went even further in claiming that only general and theoretical issues are worth discussing in ethics and that there is only one true virtue in lifeâ€”an intelligent, healthy state of mind.
