Panchen Lama,  any of the line of reincarnated lamas in Tibet, each of whom heads the influential Tashilhunpo Monastery (near Shigatse) and until recent times was second only to the Dalai Lama in spiritual authority within the dominant Dge-lugs-pa sect of Tibetan Buddhism.
The title Panchen (a short form of the Sanskrit-Tibetan Pandita Chen-po, or “Great Scholar”) was that traditionally given to head abbots of the Tashilhunpo Monastery, who were chosen for their maturity and learning. In the 17th century the fifth Dalai Lama declared that his tutor, Blo-bzang chos-kyi-rgyal-mtshan (1570–1662), who was the current Panchen Lama, would be reincarnated in a child. He thus became the first of the line of reincarnated lamas, reappearing as Blo-bzang-ye-shes (1663–1737), Blo-bzang-dpal-ldan-ye-shes (1737–80), Blo-bzang-bstan-pa’i-nyi-ma (1781–1854), Bstan-pa’i-dbang-phyug (1854–82), and Chos-kyi Nyi-ma (1883–1937). They were each regarded as physical manifestations of the buddha Amitabha. (Sometimes the three lamas who preceded Blo-bzang chos-kyi-rgyal-mtshan as abbots of Tashilhunpo are also included in the list of reincarnations.)
Disagreements between the government of the Dalai Lama and the Tashilhunpo administration over tax arrears led to the Panchen Lama’s flight to China in 1923. A boy born of Tibetan parents about 1938 in Qinghai province, China, Bskal-bzang Tshe-brtan, was recognized as his successor by the Chinese government but without having gone through the usual exacting tests that determine rebirth. He was taken to Tibet in 1952 under communist military escort and enthroned as head abbot of Tashilhunpo. The Panchen Lama remained in Tibet in 1959 after the popular revolt and the Dalai Lama’s flight into exile, but his refusal to denounce the Dalai Lama as a traitor brought him into disfavour with the Chinese government, which imprisoned him in Beijing in 1964. He was released in the late 1970s and died in 1989.
Following the death of the 10th Panchen Lama, a search was undertaken to discover his reincarnation. In 1995 the Dalai Lama recognized six-year-old Gedhun Choekyi Nyima as the 11th Panchen Lama, but this choice was rejected by the Chinese government, which took the boy into custody. The Chinese government appointed Gyancain Norbu the 11th Panchen Lama in late 1995.
