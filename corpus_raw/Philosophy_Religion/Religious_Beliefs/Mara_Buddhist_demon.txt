Māra,   the Buddhist “Lord of the Senses,” who was the Buddha’s temptor on several occasions. When the bodhisattva Gautama seated himself under the Bo tree to await Enlightenment, the evil Māra appeared first in the guise of a messenger bringing the news that a rival, Devadatta, had usurped the Śākya throne from Gautama’s family. Next Māra sent forth a great storm of rain, rocks, ashes, and darkness, frightening away all the gods who had gathered to honour the future Buddha. He challenged Gautama’s right to sit beneath the tree, provoking the future Buddha to call upon the earth to give witness to his previous charities (an act often represented in sculpture). Māra sent forth his three daughters, Tṛṣṇā, Rati, and Rāga (thirst, desire, and delight), to seduce Gautama, but to no avail. (Versions of the story differ in placing the temptation by the daughters before or after Buddha’s Enlightenment.) After the Buddha had achieved supreme Enlightenment, he experienced doubt as to whether the truth could be understood by men, and Māra pressed him to abandon any attempts to preach. But when the gods implored him to preach the law, the Buddha put aside his doubts.
