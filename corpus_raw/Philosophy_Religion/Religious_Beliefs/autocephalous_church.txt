Autocephalous church,   in the modern usage of Eastern Orthodox canon law, church that enjoys total canonical and administrative independence and elects its own primates and bishops. The term autocephalous was used in medieval Byzantine law in its literal sense of “self-headed” (Greek: autokephalos), or independent, and was applied in church law to individual dioceses that did not depend upon the authority of a provincial metropolitan. Today the Orthodox archbishopric of Mount Sinai, with the historic monastery of St. Catherine, still enjoys this privilege.
Most modern Orthodox autocephalies are national churches, but some are limited only geographically and include the territories of several states. The autocephalous churches maintain canonical relations with each other and enjoy communion in faith and sacraments. There is between them a traditional order of precedence, with the ecumenical patriarchate of Constantinople (modern Istanbul) enjoying the first place. Throughout history, their borders have varied greatly, following political and social changes, while their numbers have been subject to increase or reduction by Byzantine emperors and individual patriarchs. The question of how and by whom new autocephalous churches are to be established is still a matter of debate in modern Eastern Orthodoxy.
The heads of individual autocephalous churches bear different titles: patriarch (Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, Jerusalem, Moscow, Georgia, Serbia, Romania, Bulgaria), archbishop (Athens, Cyprus), or metropolitan (Poland, America).
