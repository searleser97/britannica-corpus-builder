Minyan, (Hebrew: “number”, ) plural Minyanim, or Minyans,  in Judaism, the minimum number of males (10) required to constitute a representative “community of Israel” for liturgical purposes. A Jewish boy of 13 may form part of the quorum after his Bar Mitzvah (religious adulthood). When a minyan is lacking for synagogue services, those who have gathered merely recite their prayers as private individuals. There is thus no public reading from the Torah (first five books of the Bible) and no Hafṭarah (selection from the prophetic books of the Bible). Such invocations as the Kaddish and qedusha are likewise omitted, for none of these is considered appropriate unless the “Jewish community” prays as one.
Similarly, the recital of the seven benedictions (shevaʿ berakhot) at a wedding and their repetition on the seven succeeding days require a minyan—with one new member participating each day. During grace after meals, “Our God” is inserted into the introductory invitation when a minyan is present, indicating again that the prayer is communal rather than private. In cases of necessity, a boy nearing his Bar Mitzvah is sometimes counted as the 10th male member. Reform and Conservative Judaism have modified the custom by allowing women to complete a minyan.
