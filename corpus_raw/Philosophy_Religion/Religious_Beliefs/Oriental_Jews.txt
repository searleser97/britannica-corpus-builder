Mizrahi Jew, Hebrew plural Mizraḥim, ʿEdot Ha-Mizraḥ (“Ethnic Groups of the East”), or Bene Ha-Mizraḥ (“Sons of the East”), also called Oriental Jew,  member or descendant of the approximately 1.5 million Jews who lived in North Africa and the Middle East up until the mid-20th century and whose ancestors did not previously reside in Europe. Collectively labeled ʿEdot Ha-Mizraḥ (Hebrew: “Ethnic Groups of the East”) in Israel upon their mass migration into the country after 1948, they were distinguished from the two other major groups of Jews—the Ashkenazim (a tradition rooted in the Rhineland) and the Sephardim (a tradition rooted in Spain).
Until the mid-20th century, communities of Jews existed throughout North Africa and the Middle East, and their diverse sets of customs varied with location. In the Arab lands of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Yemen, Palestine, Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, and Syria, Jews spoke Arabic as their native tongue. In Iran, Afghanistan, and Bukhara (Uzbekistan), they spoke Farsi (Persian). In Kurdistan (a region including parts of modern Turkey, Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Armenia), their language was a modern variant of Aramaic. Communities of Jews also existed in India, other parts of Central Asia, and China.
Although a handful of Mizrahi Jews remained in some of these countries into the 21st century, the vast majority migrated to the State of Israel following its establishment in 1948. The early waves of Mizrahi immigration were marked by discrimination and mistreatment from those already established in Israel, who were predominantly Ashkenazi. Still they became an integral part of Israeli society and polity.
