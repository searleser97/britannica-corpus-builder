Cope,   liturgical vestment worn by Roman Catholic and some Anglican clergy at non-eucharistic functions. A full-length cloak formed from a semicircular piece of cloth, it is open at the front and is fastened at the breast by hooks or a brooch. It is made of silk or other rich material in various colours. Originally, a hood was attached to the neck, but this was replaced by a shield-shaped piece of material. In the 20th century the hood was restored. The cope was adapted from the cappa choralis (“choir mantle”), a black, hooded vestment worn by clergy in processions and choir services. It is known that the cope was in use by the end of the 8th century as a liturgical vestment, and by the end of the 11th century it was universally adopted.
