Ghusl,   in Islām, the “major ablution” that entails washing the entire body in ritually pure water and is required in specified cases for both the living and the dead. The ghusl, accompanied by a statement of intent, must be performed whenever a state of major ritual impurity has been incurred: following sexual intercourse, seminal emission, menstruation, or childbirth. One who is junub (impure) cannot perform the daily ritual prayer, circumambulate the Kaʿbah in Mecca during the major and lesser pilgrimages, touch the Qurʾān or recite its verses, or enter a mosque.
Traditionally, the ghusl is also performed before the Friday prayer (ṣalāt al-jumʿah) at the mosque, the two major Muslim festivals, and the major pilgrimage (hajj). With the exception of martyrs, who by the manner of their death are forgiven their sins and are thus purified, all Muslims must undergo ghusl before burial.
