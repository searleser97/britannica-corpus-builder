Sampradaya,  in Hinduism, a traditional school of religious teaching, transmitted from one teacher to another. From about the 11th century onward, several sects emerged out of Vaishnavism (worship of the god Vishnu). These sects continue to the present day. They include the Sanaka-sampradaya (also known as Nimbarkas, the followers of Nimbarka), the Shri-sampradaya (or Shrivaishnavas, following the teaching of Ramanuja), the Brahma-sampradaya (or Madhvas, the followers of Madhva), and the Rudra-sampradaya (or Vishnusvamins, the followers of Vishnusvamin). In each case the school is named after a distant and perhaps mythological founder, such as Shri (the goddess Lakshmi), from whom it has been transmitted through a succession of teachers to the earthly founders of the sects.
