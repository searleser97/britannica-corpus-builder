Xinshu, (Chinese: “art of the heart-and-mind”) also called neiye (“inner cultivation”),  an early Chinese Daoist system aimed at purifying the practitioner’s life force (qi) and enabling him to attain awareness of true reality as encompassed in the Dao. In xinshu the purification of qi meant cleansing the mind and heart of thoughts and emotions; only when an individual had reached a state beyond conscious desires, fears, and ideas was he able to receive the spiritual power of the Dao. Control of breath seems to have been the main technique for achieving the desired state.
For the xinshu theorists, spiritual awareness was not an end in itself; their ideal figure was the sage-activist who exerted a powerful and positive influence on the governing of the nation. Health and prolonged life were also said to result from practicing xinshu. Many non-Daoists, including possibly the Confucian sage Mencius, were influenced by xinshu theory during the late 4th and early 3rd centuries bce. Its two major texts, included in the book known as the Guanzi, date from this period.
