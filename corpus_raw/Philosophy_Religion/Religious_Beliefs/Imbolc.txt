Imbolc, also called Oimelc,  (Middle Irish, probably literally, “milking”), ancient Celtic religious festival, celebrated on February 1 to mark the beginning of spring. The festival apparently was a feast of purification for farmers and has been compared to the Roman lustrations. Imbolc was associated with the goddess Brigid, and after the Christianization of Europe the day of the festival became the feast day of St. Brigit.
