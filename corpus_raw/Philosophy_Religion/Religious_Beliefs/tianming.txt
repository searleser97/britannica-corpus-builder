Tianming, Wade-Giles romanization t’ien ming (Chinese: “mandate of heaven”),  in Chinese Confucian thought, the notion that heaven (tian) conferred directly upon an emperor, the son of heaven (tianzi), the right to rule. The doctrine had its beginnings in the early Zhou dynasty (c. 1046–256 bce).
The continuation of the mandate was believed to be conditioned by the personal behaviour of the ruler, who was expected to possess yi (“righteousness”) and ren (“benevolence”). If the emperor’s personal life became immoral or his rule tyrannical, Confucianists taught, he had not only lost his right to rule but should be removed by revolution, if necessary. Chinese historians frequently make much of the dissolute life of the last emperor of each dynasty, thereby confirming the Confucian principle that heaven itself had withdrawn its mandate and had passed it on to another.
