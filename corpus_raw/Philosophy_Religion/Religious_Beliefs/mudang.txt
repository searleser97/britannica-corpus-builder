mudang,  in Korean shamanism, a priestess who employs magic to effect cures, to tell fortunes, to soothe spirits of the dead, and to repulse evil. Her male counterpart is called a paksu. Both, however, are also known by numerous other names in various parts of Korea.
Hereditary mudang, especially in former times, formed a separate religious group of low social standing and seldom married into families on a higher social level. Daughters of such shamans became either mudang after proper training or kisaeng, artistic entertainers similar to Japanese geisha. Sons of hereditary shamans usually became singers of p’ansori, the one-person opera of Korea, or musicians accompanying shamanistic rituals.
The principal occasion for the performance of a mudang is the kut, a trance ritual in which singing and dancing are used to invite happiness and repel evil. The kut usually comprises 12 kŏri (procedures), each of which is addressed to specific gods or spirits such as the god of childbirth, good harvest, and property, the goddesses in control of specific diseases, the patron spirit of shamans, or the protector god of households. Before the kut begins, an altar is set on the floor and offerings are made. As the ritual progresses, the mudang goes into a trance during which the god is said to arrive, to be placated, and then to communicate a message to the client (on behalf of a family, a village, or the state) through the mudang.
In modern times, the professionalism and attendant esteem of the mudang have increasingly fallen prey to economic opportunism.
