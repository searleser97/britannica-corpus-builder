Arbaʿ kanfot, also spelled arbaʿ kanfoth (Hebrew: “four corners”), also called ṭallit qaṭan, or tallith katan,   (“small shawl”), Jewish religious garment that apparently came into use during times of persecution as a substitute for the larger and more conspicuous prayer shawl (ṭallit). Both garments have fringes (tzitzit) on the four corners, increasing the likelihood that one was a conscious imitation of the other. The ṭallit, however, generally falls across the head, neck, and shoulders, while the arbaʿ kanfot has an opening for the head (like a poncho), so that it can be worn beneath the upper garments. Orthodox male Jews, including children, wear the arbaʿ kanfot during the day to fulfill the requirement of wearing fringes (Numbers 15:37–41) as reminders of God’s commandments.
