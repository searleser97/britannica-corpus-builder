Shaivism,  organized worship of the Indian god Shiva and, with Vaishnavism and Shaktism, one of the three principal forms of modern Hinduism. Shaivism includes such diverse movements as the highly philosophical Shaiva-siddhanta, the socially distinctive Lingayat, ascetics such as the dashnami sannyasins, and innumerable folk variants.
The Vedas speak of the mysterious, uncanny god Rudra (“the Howler”), whose name later became an epithet of Shiva (“Auspicious One”). The Shvetashvatara Upanishad treats Shiva as the paramount deity, and Shiva is an important god in the two great Sanskrit epics, the Mahabharata and the Ramayana. But it was not until sometime between the 2nd century bce and the 2nd century ce and the rise of the Pashupata sect that organized sectarian worship developed. From then on, temples and festivals dedicated to Shiva, religious institutions for Shaiva renunciants, and Shaiva places of pilgrimage thrived throughout India.
There are several schools of modern Shaiva thought, ranging from pluralistic realism to absolute monism (see pluralism and monism). One, the Shaiva-siddhanta, recognizes three principles: Pati, Shiva, the Lord; pashu, the individual soul; and pasha, the bonds that confine the soul to earthly existence. The goal set for the soul is to get rid of its bonds and gain shivatva (“the nature of Shiva”). The paths leading to that goal are charya (external acts of worship), kriya (acts of intimate service to God), Yoga (meditation), and jnana (knowledge). Shaivism, like some of the other forms of Hinduism, spread to other parts of Southeast Asia, including Java, Bali, and parts of the Southeast Asian continent, including Cambodia.
