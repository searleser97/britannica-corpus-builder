Seide,  in Sami religion, idols of wood or stone, either natural or slightly shaped by human hands, worshipped as possessing impersonal supernatural power or as actually being inhabited by a spirit with whom one could communicate. Seides were most commonly located in places where some feature of the topography, such as rapids or steep rocks, sharply distinguished the place from the rest of the landscape. The seide itself could consist of a high promontory or a rock jutting out in an unusual fashion or shaped in such a way as to cause wonder. Many of the seides were located in areas associated with the subterranean otherworld or world of the dead (saivo). Seides could be worshipped by an individual, a family, and even an entire lineage. One of the many seides was generally singled out as greater than the others and worshipped as the common deity of all in the village. It was situated higher than the others, lesser family gods being placed lower at the site of worship. The seides were believed to protect the people and bring them good fortune in their undertakings. Sacrifices of reindeer, fish, game, and other offerings were made to them. The power of the seide could be determined by the number of sacrifices made to it, because this was a direct reflection of the worshippersâ€™ trust and faith in the idol. The seide ruled only the particular area in which it was located and received its significance from its natural context, which caused it to inspire awe in its worshippers.
