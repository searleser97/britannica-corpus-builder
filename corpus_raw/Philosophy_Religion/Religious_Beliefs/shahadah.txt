Shahādah, (Arabic: “testimony”)  the Muslim profession of faith: “There is no god but God; Muhammad is the Prophet of God.” The shahādah is the first of the five Pillars of Islam (arkān al-Islām). It must be recited by every Muslim at least once in a lifetime, aloud, correctly, and purposively, with a full understanding of its meaning and with an assent of the heart.
