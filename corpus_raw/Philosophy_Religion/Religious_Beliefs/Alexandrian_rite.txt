Alexandrian rite,  the system of liturgical practices and discipline in use among Egyptian and Ethiopian Christians of both the Eastern-rite Catholic and independent Christian churches.
The Alexandrian rite is historically associated with John Mark, a disciple of the Apostles, who traveled to Alexandria, the Greek-speaking capital of the diocese of Egypt and the cultural centre of the Eastern Roman Empire.
The liturgy of the modern Coptic Catholic church developed from the Byzantine liturgy attributed to St. John Chrysostom, as modified by Syrian and other influences. The service book is written in Coptic, with the Arabic running in parallel columns, though readings from the Apostles and the Gospels are in Arabic.
The Ethiopian Orthodox liturgy (see Ethiopian Orthodox church) was derived from the Coptic and is in the classical Ethiopic Ge øez language. The liturgy and Scriptures have been translated into Amharic, the dominant modern Ethiopic language.
