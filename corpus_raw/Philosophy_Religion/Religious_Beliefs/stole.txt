Stole,   ecclesiastical vestment worn by Roman Catholic deacons, priests, and bishops and by some Anglican, Lutheran, and other Protestant clergy. A band of silk 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 centimetres) wide and about 8 feet (240 centimetres) long, it is the same colour as the major vestments worn for the occasion. Some Protestant clergy wear stoles with colours or symbols that do not conform to liturgical colours. The Roman Catholic deacon wears it over the left shoulder with ends joined under the right arm; priests and bishops wear it around the neck with ends hanging vertically, except that priests cross the ends in front when wearing an alb. In the Roman Catholic Church it is a symbol of immortality. It is generally considered the unique badge of the ordained ministry and is conferred at ordination.
Its origins are obscure, but it probably derived from a handkerchief or a secular scarf used as a symbol of rank. In the 4th century it was worn as a vestment by deacons in the Eastern churches, and it was adopted somewhat later in the West. Originally called orarium or orarion, it was probably intended for wiping the mouth. The Latin term stola came into use in the 9th century.
In the Eastern churches the equivalent vestment is the epitrachelion worn by priests and the orarion worn by deacons.
A stole is also a long scarf of cloth or fur worn by women over the shoulders with the ends hanging down in front. It probably developed from a long, robe-like outer garment worn by matrons in ancient Rome.
