fast of Gedaliah,  a minor Jewish observance (on Tishri 3) that mournfully recalls the assassination of Gedaliah, Jewish governor of Judah and appointee of Nebuchadrezzar, the Babylonian king. Gedaliah, a supporter of Jeremiah, was slain by Ishmael, a member of the former royal family of Judah. When the remaining Jews fled to Egypt, Jewish self-rule was thus effectively ended. Liturgically, the fast of Gedaliah follows the ritual of other fast days but adds certain penitential prayers. The festival is postponed one day if Tishri 3 falls on the Sabbath. The Fast of Gedaliah is observed on Thursday, September 9, 2021.
