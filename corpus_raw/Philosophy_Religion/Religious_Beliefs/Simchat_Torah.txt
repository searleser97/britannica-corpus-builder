Simchat Torah, Simchat also spelled Simhat, Simhath, Simchas, Simchath, or Simchat Hebrew Simḥat Torah,  (“Rejoicing of the Torah”), Jewish religious observance held on the last day of Sukkot (“Festival of Booths”), when the yearly cycle of Torah reading is completed and the next cycle is begun. Torah scrolls are removed from the ark and carried through the synagogue seven times in a joyful procession, sometimes followed by children waving flags. There are singing and dancing and, for the children, sweets. The rejoicing characteristic of Simchat Torah is meant to express the joy that Jews feel in their possession and observance of the words of the Torah (the “Law”). Simhath Torah is celebrated on Wednesday, September 29, 2021.
