Tama, formally mitama,  in Japanese religion, a soul or a divine or semidivine spirit; also an aspect of a spirit. Several mitama are recognized in Shint≈ç and folk religions. Among them are the ara-mitama (with the power of ruling), the kushi-mitama (with the power of transforming), the nigi-mitama (with the power of unifying, or harmonizing), and the saki-mitama (with the power of blessing). Some shrines pay homage to a particular mitama of a deity, such as the separate shrines dedicated to the ara-mitama and the nigi-mitama of the goddess Amaterasu.
