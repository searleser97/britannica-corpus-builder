Imposition of hands, also called Laying On Of Hands,  ritual act in which a priest or other religious functionary places one or both hands palms down on the top of another personâ€™s head, usually while saying a prayer or blessing. The imposition of hands was first practiced in Judaism and was adopted by Christianity. In the Hebrew Bible it is associated with three interrelated ideas: consecration (i.e., setting apart for the service of God), transmission of a divine gift, and identification (the means whereby an offerer was linked with his sacrifice).
In the New Testament the same ideas are present; all of these ideas are connected with ordination and baptism, in both of which the imposition of hands is a standard part of the ritual. Ordination involves both setting apart and the conveyance of a gift, and the theme of identification is implicit in that the one ordained shares in the authority and is the representative of the ordainer. The imposition of hands connected with baptism is a means whereby the convert is identified and so brought into the community; it is further a setting apart for the service of God and is, on occasion, connected with the gift of the Holy Spirit. The New Testament further indicates that the imposition of hands conveyed a blessing and was a means of healing.
The early church continued these uses and added two more: the imposition of hands for the blessing of catechumens (i.e., those preparing for baptism) and for the reconciliation of penitents and heretics. The church has preserved the use of this ritual act, primarily in the rites of ordination and confirmation.
