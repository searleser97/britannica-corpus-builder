Havdala, (Hebrew: “Separation”, ) also spelled Habdalah, or Havdalah,  a ceremony in Jewish homes and in synagogues concluding the Sabbath and religious festivals. The ceremony consists of benedictions that are recited over a cup of wine (and, on the night of the Sabbath, over spices and a braided candle) to praise God, who deigned to sanctify these days and thus “separate” them from routine weekdays. The prayer distinguishes holy from secular, light from darkness, and Israelites from Gentiles. If a festival begins at the closing of the Sabbath, no spices are used, the candle lit for the festival replaces the Sabbath candle, and a special form of the Havdala (indicating the greater holiness of the Sabbath) is combined with the special benediction (Qiddush) that ushers in the festival.
