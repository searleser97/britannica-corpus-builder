Ritsu, (Japanese: “Regulation”, ) Chinese Lü-tsung,  school of Buddhist moral discipline primarily concerned with vinaya, or the rules of monastic and religious practice. The school was founded in China in the 7th century by the monk Tao-hsüan on the basis of Theravāda texts that emphasized the letter of the law, as compared with the later Mahāyāna texts that relied on the spirit, or essence, of the moral law. The leading centre of Ritsu ordination in central China is the Pao-hua Shan monastery near Nanking. The monks of Pao-hua Shan are renowned in China for their austerity and their learning.
During the Nara period (710–784) in Japan, the Buddhists felt handicapped by a lack of ordained priests qualified to carry out the formal ceremonies of initiation and sent an invitation to Chien-chen (Japanese: Ganjin), a leading Chinese scholar of vinaya. Members of the Japanese imperial family, including the reigning empress, were among the first to be ordained by him, after his arrival in 754.
In the 13th century the priest Eison initiated a reform movement within the Ritsu school in Japan, employing more informal, self-imposed vows. As the various sects in Japan developed their own initiation rituals, the Ritsu school declined, and it is no longer an influential force in that country.
