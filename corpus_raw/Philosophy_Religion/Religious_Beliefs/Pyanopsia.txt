Pyanopsia, also spelled Pyanepsia,  in ancient Greek religion, a festival in honour of Apollo, held at Athens on the seventh day of the month of Pyanopsion (October). The festivalâ€™s rites incorporated remnants of rustic magic, including two offerings, consisting of a hodgepodge of pulse (edible seeds) and a branch of olive or laurel bound with wool, around which were hung fruits of the season, pastries, and small jars of honey, oil, and wine. The offerings were carried to the Temple of Apollo, where they were suspended on the gate. The doors of private houses were similarly adorned. Both offerings have been connected with the Cretan expedition of Theseus, who vowed a thank offering to Apollo if he were successful in slaying the Minotaur.
