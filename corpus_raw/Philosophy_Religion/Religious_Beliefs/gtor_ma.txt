Gtor-ma,   sacrificial cakes used in Tibetan Buddhist ceremonies as offerings to deities. The unbaked cakes are prepared by kneading parched barley flour and butter into the shapes of cones, decorated with pats of butter. The cakes form part of the phyi-mchod, or eight offerings of external worship, as well as part of the offerings of the five senses, which are considered internal worship. For presentation to the wrathful Tantric deities (dharmapālas), the gtor-ma are realistically coloured and modelled to resemble parts of the human body.
Larger and more elaborate cakes as much as 10 feet (3 metres) high differ in shape, colour, and size according to the deity they honour.
The offerings are arranged for a ceremony on a side table in tiers, with those honouring the chief divinities on the top tier; the cakes of the “defenders of the faith” and lesser divinities below; the offerings of the five senses next; and the offerings of external worship on the bottom tier. Worshippers lay their informal gifts of fruit or cooked food below the table. After the ceremony, all the offerings are distributed among those present.
