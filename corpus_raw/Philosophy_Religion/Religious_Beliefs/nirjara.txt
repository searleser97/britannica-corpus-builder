Nirjara,  in Jainism, a religion of India, the destruction of karman (a physical substance that binds itself to individual souls and determines their fate).
For the soul to achieve moksha, or liberation from rebirth, the believer must expel existing karman and prevent the accumulation of new karman. Nirjara is accomplished by undergoing physical and spiritual austerities, including fasting, mortification of the body, confession and penance, reverence for superiors, service to others, meditation and study, and indifference to the body and its needs. In its extreme form, the last practice has sometimes led to death by ritual self-starvation (sallekhana), though rarely in modern times. The prevention of the accumulation of new karman is called samvara. This is accomplished by observing moral vows (vratas); controlling body, speech, and mind; taking care in walking and handling things; developing moral virtues; and patiently enduring pain and trouble.
