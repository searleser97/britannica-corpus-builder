Doctor of the church,  in Roman Catholicism, any of the 36 saints whose doctrinal writings have special authority. The writings and teachings of the various doctors of the church are of particular importance to Roman Catholic theology, and their works are considered to be both true and timeless. Although the title is not used in the same way in Eastern Orthodoxy, the Orthodox church esteems the 17 doctors of the church who died before the East-West Schism of 1045, and Saints John Chrysostom, Basil the Great, and Gregory of Nazianzus are especially honoured as the Three Holy Hierarchs.
In early Christianity the Western church recognized four doctors of the church—Ambrose, Augustine, Gregory the Great, and Jerome—and later adopted the Three Holy Hierarchs of the Eastern church and also Athanasius the Great. Since the 16th century dozens more have been given the term doctor by formal proclamation of the Roman Catholic Church, among them Saints Thomas Aquinas (1567), Bonaventure (1588), Anselm (1720), Leo I (1754), Bernard (1830), Francis of Sales (1877), the Venerable Bede (1899), Albertus Magnus (1931), Anthony of Padua (1946), Teresa of Ávila (1970), Catherine of Siena (1970), Thérèse of Lisieux (1997), and Hildegard (2012).
