Mālikī, also called Madhhab Mālik,  in Islam, one of the four Sunni schools of law, formerly the ancient school of Medina. Founded in the 8th century and based on the teachings of the imam Mālik ibn Anas, the Mālikīs stressed local Medinese community practice (ʿamal) as the lens through which to understand the legal implications of the Qurʾān and the Hadith (traditions concerning the Prophet Muhammad’s life and utterances). At the same time, the Malikīs were open to analogical reasoning (qiyās) and applied juristic discretion (istihsan) to ensure beneficial legal outcomes. The Mālikī school currently prevails throughout northern and western Africa, in Sudan, and in some of the Persian Gulf states.
