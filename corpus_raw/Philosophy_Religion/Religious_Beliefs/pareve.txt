Pareve, also spelled Parve, or Parveh,  (Yiddish: “neutral”), in the observance of Jewish dietary laws (kashrut), those foods that may be eaten indiscriminately, with either meat dishes or dairy products—two general classes of food that may not be consumed at the same meal. Fruits and vegetables are classified as pareve unless cooking or processing alters their status. In modern times, cakes and similar foods are classed as pareve, provided they are made with vegetable oil (rather than butter) and with “neutral” liquids substituted for milk.
