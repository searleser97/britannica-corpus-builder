Vishu, also spelled Viṣu,  spring festival observed by Malayali Hindus in Kerala and in adjacent areas of Tamil Nadu, India. Vishu (Sanskrit: “equal”) celebrates the vernal equinox, when day and night are roughly equal length. Although the astronomical equinox falls in late March, the Vishu festival falls on the first day of the Malayali month of Medam, which occurs on either April 14 or 15 on the Gregorian calendar.
The festival begins at sunrise with a religious offering for the upcoming year. A tray of flowers, especially the yellow blooms of the golden shower tree, along with fruits and vegetables, rice, coins, and gifts, is placed beside a lamp in the family puja room or in Hindu temples. Seeing this offering—called the vishukkani (“first sight on Vishu”)—first thing upon waking is thought to bring an abundance of its contents over the coming year. As such, children are often led to the vishukkani with their eyes covered. The contents of the vishukkani are afterwards gifted or donated. The coins (called kaineettam) are typically distributed to the children by an older family member.
Observance of the holiday continues with other festive traditions. A traditional Malayali sadhya banquet is prepared, which includes banana chips, curries, rice dishes, and other items served on a banana leaf. Young people dress in dried banana leaves and don masks, going door-to-door in groups to dance and receive money in return. Fireworks are set off in celebration as well.
