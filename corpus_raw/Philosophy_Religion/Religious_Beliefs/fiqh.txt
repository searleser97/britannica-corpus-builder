Fiqh, (Arabic: “understanding”)  Muslim jurisprudence—i.e., the science of ascertaining the precise terms of the Sharīʿah, or Islamic law. The collective sources of Muslim jurisprudence are known as uṣūl al-fiqh. While Sharīʿah is considered to be divine and immutable, fiqh, the human effort to know the Sharīʿah, is imperfect and changeable.
