Harvest Home, also called Ingathering,  traditional English harvest festival, celebrated from antiquity and surviving to modern times in isolated regions. Participants celebrate the last day of harvest in late September by singing, shouting, and decorating the village with boughs. The cailleac, or last sheaf of corn (grain), which represents the spirit of the field, is made into a harvest doll and drenched with water as a rain charm. This sheaf is saved until spring planting.
The ancient festival also included the symbolic murder of the grain spirit, as well as rites for expelling the devil.
A similar festival was traditionally held in parts of Ireland, Scotland, and northern Europe.
