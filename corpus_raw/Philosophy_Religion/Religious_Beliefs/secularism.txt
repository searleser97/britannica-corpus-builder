Secularism,  any movement in society directed away from otherworldliness to life on earth.
In the Middle Ages in Europe there was a strong tendency for religious persons to despise human affairs and to meditate on God and the afterlife. As a reaction to this medieval tendency, secularism, at the time of the Renaissance, exhibited itself in the development of humanism, when people began to show more interest in human cultural achievements and the possibilities of their fulfillment in this world.
The movement toward secularism has been in progress during the entire course of modern history and has often been viewed as being anti-Christian and antireligious. In the latter half of the 20th century, however, some theologians began advocating secular Christianity. They suggested that Christianity should not be concerned only with the sacred and the otherworldly but that people should find in the world the opportunity to promote Christian values. These theologians maintained that the real meaning of the message of Jesus can be discovered and fulfilled in the everyday affairs of secular living.
