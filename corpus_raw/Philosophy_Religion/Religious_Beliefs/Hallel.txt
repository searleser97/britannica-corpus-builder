Hallel,   (Hebrew: “Praise”), Jewish liturgical designation for Psalms 113–118 (“Egyptian Hallel”) as read in synagogues on festive occasions. In ancient times Jews recited these hymns on the three Pilgrim Festivals, when they offered their required sacrifices in the Temple of Jerusalem. The Psalms expressed faith in, and gratitude for, Divine Providence.
Though a benediction usually precedes and follows recitation of the Psalms, the preceding benediction is omitted on the eve of Passover (Pesaḥ). The Talmud stipulates that a reading from the Book of Esther should replace the Hallel on Purim.
In time, the term Hallel came to mean the “Great Hallel,” Psalm 136, which is used in the morning service on the Sabbath, festivals, and during the Passover seder. The “half-Hallel” (parts of Psalms 115 and 116 are omitted) is used on the last six days of Passover and on the New Moon.
