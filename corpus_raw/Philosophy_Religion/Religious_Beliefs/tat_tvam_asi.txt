Tat tvam asi, (Sanskrit: “thou art that”)  in Hinduism, the famous expression of the relationship between the individual and the Absolute. The statement is frequently repeated in the sixth chapter of the Chandogya Upanishad (c. 600 bce) as the teacher Uddalaka Aruni instructs his son in the nature of brahman, the supreme reality. The identity expressed in this judgment was variously interpreted by the different darshans (schools) of the orthodox philosophy of Vedanta. The phrase was given its most literal interpretation by the 8th–9th-century thinker Shankara of the Advaita (Nondualist) school, for whom the statement was one of the great assertions fundamental to his doctrine.
