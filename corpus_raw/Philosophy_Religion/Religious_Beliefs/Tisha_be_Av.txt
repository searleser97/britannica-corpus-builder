Tisha be-Av, also spelled Tisha b’Av, English Ninth of Av,  in Judaism, traditional day of mourning for the destruction of the First and Second Temples. According to the Talmud, other disastrous events such as the following occurred on Av 9: the decree that the Jews would wander 40 years in the wilderness; the fall of Bethar in 135 ce, ending the second Jewish revolt against Rome; and the establishment in 136 of a pagan temple in Jerusalem, which Jews were no longer permitted to enter. The expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492 is also traditionally believed to have occurred on that date. From sunset to sunset, a 24-hour fast is observed, except by Reform Jews. The liturgy of the day, performed by candlelight in a gloomy atmosphere, includes the reading of the Lamentations of Jeremiah and the recital of dirges (qinot); certain passages from the Old Testament are also read. Many Jews visit the cemetery on this day. If Tisha be-Av falls on the Sabbath (“Black Sabbath”), the observance is postponed one day. Tisha be-Av marks the end of a period of mourning called the Three Weeks.
