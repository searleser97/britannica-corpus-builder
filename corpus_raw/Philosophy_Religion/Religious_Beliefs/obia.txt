Obia, also spelled Obeah,  in west African folklore, a gigantic animal that steals into villages and kidnaps girls on the behalf of witches. In certain cultures of the Caribbean, the term denotes forms of sorcery and witchcraft, usually overpowering and extremely evil. Potent or bewitched objects buried for the purpose of bringing misfortune upon a particular party are sometimes known as obia, and use of the word itself has in some areas been prohibited by law. A specialist using the power of obia is called an obiama or obiaman.
