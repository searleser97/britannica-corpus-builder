Fātiḥah, also called fātiḥat al-kitāb,  the “opening” or first chapter (surah) of the Muslim book of divine revelation, the Qurʾān; in tone and usage it has often been likened to the Christian Lord’s Prayer. In contrast to the other surahs, which are usually narratives or exhortations delivered by God, the seven verses of the fātiḥah form a short devotional prayer addressed to God, and in oral recitation they are ended with the word amīn (“amen”). The fātiḥah has acquired broad ceremonial usage in Islam: it introduces each ritual bowing (rakʿah) in the five daily prayers (ṣalāt), and it is recited at all Muslim sanctuaries, validates important resolutions, appears frequently on amulets, and is recited for the dead.
In North Africa, fātiḥah (or fatḥah) designates a prayer performed silently with arms outstretched, palms turned upward. The first surah is not necessarily recited but was probably once part of the ceremony.
