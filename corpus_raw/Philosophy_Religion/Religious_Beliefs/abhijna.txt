Abhijna, (Sanskrit: “supernatural knowledge”) , Pali abhinna,  in Buddhist philosophy, miraculous power obtained especially through meditation and wisdom. Usually five kinds of abhijna are enumerated: the ability (1) to travel any distance or take on any form at will, (2) to see everything, (3) to hear everything, (4) to know another’s thoughts, and (5) to recollect former existences.
A sixth miraculous power, freedom by undefiled wisdom, is exclusively the prerogative of buddhas and arhats (saints). An earlier enumeration of three knowledges consists of this sixth abhijna together with the powers of recollecting previous existences and of seeing everything and thus knowing the future destinies of all beings.
The first five abhijnas enumerated in Buddhism are identical with the siddhis (miraculous powers) known to Indian ascetics in general. Patanjali, for example, mentions them in his Yoga-sutra (the classical exposition of Yoga) as magical virtues of meditation. Goblins and deities are said to be endowed naturally with such powers.
Attainment of the abhijnas is regarded as an indication of spiritual progress. According to the Buddha in the Theravada tradition, however, indulgence in the abhijnas is to be avoided, since their use is a powerful distraction from the path toward enlightenment, which is the sixth abhijna and the final goal.
