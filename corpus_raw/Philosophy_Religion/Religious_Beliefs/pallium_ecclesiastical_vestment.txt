Pallium,  liturgical vestment worn over the chasuble by the pope, archbishops, and some bishops in the Roman Catholic church. It is bestowed by the pope on archbishops and bishops having metropolitan jurisdiction as a symbol of their participation in papal authority. It is made of a circular strip of white lambâ€™s wool about two inches wide and is placed over the shoulders. Two vertical bands, extending from the circular strip in the front and back, give the pallium a Y-shaped appearance. Six crosses, one each on the chest and back and on each shoulder and band, adorn the vestment.
The pallium probably developed from the ancient Greek himation, called pallium by the Romans, an outer garment formed from a rectangular piece of cloth draped around the body as a mantle or folded and carried over the shoulder when not needed for warmth. Gradually, the pallium became narrower and resembled a long scarf. The Y-shaped pallium probably developed during the 7th century.
The use of the pallium by church officials developed from the secular tradition of emperors and other high officials wearing a special scarf as a badge of office. The pallium was worn by many bishops in the 4th and 5th centuries, and in the 6th century the pope was conferring it as a symbol of distinction. Since the 9th century, an archbishop cannot exercise his metropolitan jurisdiction until he has received the pallium from the pope. He can wear it only within his own province; only the pope can wear it anywhere.
The equivalent vestment in the Eastern churches is the omophorion, a long, white silk or velvet embroidered scarf, worn by bishops celebrating the holy liturgy.
