Berakah, also spelled Berakha, orBerachah (Hebrew: “blessing”), plural Berakoth, Berakot, Berachoth, orBerachot,  in Judaism, a benediction (expression of praise or thanks directed to God) that is recited at specific points of the synagogue liturgy, during private prayer, or on other occasions (e.g., before performing a commandment or for being spared from harm in the face of danger). Most berakoth begin with the words Barukh Attah Adonai Eloheinu Melekh ha-Olam (“Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe”).
Berakoth for food and wine are customarily recited in many Jewish homes as a grace before meals—e.g., “Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who hast created the fruit of the vine.” Many of the berakoth also thank God for choosing the Jewish people to observe the holidays and remember him in this way.
