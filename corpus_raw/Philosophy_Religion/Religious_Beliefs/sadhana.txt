Sadhana, Sanskrit Sādhana,   (“realization”), in Hindu and Buddhist Tantrism, spiritual exercise by which the practitioner evokes a divinity, identifying and absorbing it into himself—the primary form of meditation in the Tantric Buddhism of Tibet. Sadhana involves the body in mudras (sacred gestures), the voice in mantras (sacred utterances), and the mind in the vivid inner visualization of sacred designs and the figures of divinities. Detailed instructions on how the images are to be visualized and the appropriate mantra for each are contained in written sadhanas of most divinities. One such collection is the Sādhanamālā (Sanskrit: “Garland of Realization”), composed perhaps between the 5th and the 11th century. This collection of some 300 sadhanas includes those designed for various practical results as well as those intended to further spiritual realization. The written sadhanas also serve to instruct sculptors and painters.
The mastery of visualizing the divinities in order of increasing complexity requires hours of practice each day for a period of years. In the resultant state of consciousness, such concepts as the illusory nature of phenomena and one’s identity with the ultimate are said to become experiential realities.
