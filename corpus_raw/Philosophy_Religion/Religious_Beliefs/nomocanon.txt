Nomocanon,   Byzantine collection of ecclesiastical legislation (canons) and civil laws (Greek nomoi) related to the Christian church. The nomocanon in its various redactions served as legal text in the Eastern church until the 18th century. In form and content it reflected a tight alliance between church and state and met the requirements of judges and lawyers obliged to use simultaneously the ecclesiastical canons and the imperial laws. In the 6th century, two main forms of the nomocanon were accepted simultaneously: the Nomocanon 50 titulorum and the Nomocanon 14 titulorum. The latter, compiled by the patriarch Johannes Scholasticus (565–577), was later updated by the patriarch Photius (c. 820–891) and published anew in 883. A Slavic adaptation of the Byzantine nomocanons was compiled by Sava, the first archbishop of Serbia (1219), under the title of Kormchaya kniga (“Book of the Helmsman”), which was adopted by all the Slavic Orthodox churches. In the 18th century the need for collections of imperial laws having disappeared, new compilations, including only the ecclesiastical canons, replaced both the nomocanons and the Kormchaya kniga. The most important of these new compilations, excerpts from the nomocanon, were the Pēdalion (“Rudder”), for the Greeks, and the Kniga pravil (“Book of Rules”), for the Russians.
