Tariqa, also spelled tariqah, Arabic tarīqah,  (“road,” “path,” or “way”), the Muslim spiritual path toward direct knowledge (maʿrifah) of God or Reality (ḥaqq). In the 9th and 10th centuries, tariqa meant the spiritual path of individual Sufis (mystics). After the 12th century, as communities of followers gathered around sheikhs (or pīrs, “teachers”), tariqa came to designate the sheikh’s entire ritual system, which was followed by the community or mystic order. Eventually tariqa came to mean the order itself.
Each mystic order claimed a chain of spiritual descent (silsilah) from the Prophet Muhammad, established procedures for initiation of members (murīd, ikhwān, dervish, and fakir), and prescribed disciplines. By following the path of a known “friend of God,” or Sufi saint, under the guidance of his sheikh, the Sufi might himself achieve the mystical state (ḥāl) of the friends of God (awliyāʾ Allāh, singular wālī Allāh). Though sober teachers inveighed against excesses, the search for spiritual ecstasy sometimes led to such practices as drug taking and wild acrobatics, activities that earned for some of the orders the names whirling, howling, and dancing dervishes. Dervish orders frequently established monasteries (ribat, khankah, zāwiyah, and tekke) in which laity as well as members were invited to stay.
First established in the 12th century, the orders numbered in the hundreds by the mid-20th century, with a membership in the millions. The greatest expansion of Sufi tariqas was in the central Islamic countries, where they played a vital role in the religious life of the Muslim community. Orders also exist in West Africa, eastern Europe, India, and Central and Far Eastern Asia.
