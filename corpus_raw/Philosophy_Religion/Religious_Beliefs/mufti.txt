Mufti, Arabic muftī,  an Islamic legal authority who gives a formal legal opinion (fatwa) in answer to an inquiry by a private individual or judge. A fatwa usually requires knowledge of the Qurʾān and Hadith (narratives concerning the Prophet’s life and sayings), as well as knowledge of exegesis and collected precedents, and might be a pronouncement on some problematic legal matter. In the Ottoman Empire, the mufti of Istanbul, the shaykh al-Islām (Turkish: şeyhülislâm), ranked as Islam’s foremost legal authority, theoretically presiding over the whole judicial and theological hierarchy. The development of civil codes in most Islamic countries, however, has tended to restrict the authority of muftis to cases involving personal status and religious custom, such as inheritance, marriage, and divorce. Even in this area, the prerogatives of the mufti are in some cases circumscribed by modern legislation.
