Extrinsicism,   in philosophy or theology or both, the tendency to place major emphasis on external matters rather than on more profound realities. In terms of morals and ethics, it tends to stress the external observance of laws and precepts, with lesser concern for the ultimate principles underlying moral conduct.
In Christian thought, for example, this is illustrated by the tendency to define the church in terms of such exterior elements as its social structure, rituals, and the obligations it imposes on the faithful, rather than to view it as an essentially spiritual entity. Historically, extrinsicism has been an important factor in disputes over the nature of supernatural grace.
