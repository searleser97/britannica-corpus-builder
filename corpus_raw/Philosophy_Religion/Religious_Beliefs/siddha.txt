Siddha,   in Jainism, one who has achieved perfection. By right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct a siddha has freed himself from the cycle of rebirths and resides in a state of perpetual bliss in the siddha-śīlā, at the top of the universe. The siddha and the other ascetics constitute the pañca-parameṣṭhin, the five chief divinities of the Jainas. Their figures are represented on a silver or brass tray called a siddha-cakra (saint-wheel), to which great sanctity and magical power are attributed. In the twice-yearly ceremony known as oḷī, the images are washed and anointed, and offerings of rice, sweetmeats, and fruit are made.
In the Digambara sect the saint-wheel is called navapada (“nine dignities,” or “nine virtues”) and consists of the pañca-parameṣṭhin plus the Jina (saviour) image, temple, scriptures, and dharma-cakra (sacred wheel of the law).
