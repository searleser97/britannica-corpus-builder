Cherub, plural cherubim,  in Jewish, Christian, and Islamic literature, a celestial winged being with human, animal, or birdlike characteristics who functions as a throne bearer of the Deity. Derived from ancient Middle Eastern mythology and iconography, these celestial beings serve important liturgical and intercessory functions in the hierarchy of angels. The term most likely derives from the Akkadian kāribu, or kūribu (from the verb karābu, meaning “to pray” or “to bless”).
Hebrew Bible descriptions of the cherubim emphasize their supernatural mobility and their cultic role as throne bearers of God, rather than their intercessory functions. In Christianity the cherubim are ranked among the higher orders of angels and, as celestial attendants of God, continually praise him. Known as karūbiyūn in Islam, the cherubim continuously praise God by repeating the tasbīḥ (“Glory to Allah”) and dwell in peace in an area of the heavens that is inaccessible to attacks from Iblīs, the Devil. Compare seraph.
