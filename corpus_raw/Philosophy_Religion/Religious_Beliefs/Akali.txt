Akali, (Punjabi: “Timeless One,” or “Eternal One”)  a movement in Sikhism. Akali also refers to any member of suicide squads in the armies of the Sikhs in India. The Akali suicide squads first appeared about 1690. Earlier in that century the Mughals had executed Arjan and Tegh Bahadur, the fifth and ninth Gurus, respectively, and the continued Mughal persecution of the Sikhs forced Gobind Singh, the 10th Guru, to take up arms. The Akalis were also known as nihangs (Persian: “crocodiles”; a name first used by the Mughals for Sikh suicide squads) and wore a distinctive blue uniform. Some present-day Akalis continue to wear a blue tunic and a conical blue turban and to carry a sword.
The Akali name was revived in the 1920s during the gurdwara reform movement as a quasi-military corps of volunteers raised to oppose British rule in India. After the Sikhs regained control of their gurdwaras (places of worship), the Akalis continued to represent the Sikh community in the Punjab region, and, following Indian independence in 1947, they took the lead in the agitation for a Punjabi-speaking Sikh-majority state. That goal was achieved in 1966 when the Indian state of Punjab was divided: the northwestern portion remained Punjab, and the southeastern section became the predominantly Hindi-speaking state of Haryana. A major political party of Punjab state is the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD; “Supreme Akali Party”). Although it competes in national elections, the SAD is mainly concerned with the welfare of the Sikhs in Punjab state.
