Siyyum,   (Hebrew: “termination”), joyous celebration observed by Jews, either when a study group completes a tractate of the Talmud (rabbinic compendium of law, lore, and commentary) or when the writing of a Torah scroll (first five books of the Bible) is completed.
The study of the Talmud is frequently arranged so that a tractate can be finished on the eve of Passover (Pesaḥ). Because a special meal (seʿuddat mitzva) follows a study of the final passage, the firstborn is exempt from his usual fast on that day. When a Torah scroll is near completion, males are generally allowed the privilege of writing one of the final letters on the sacred manuscript. This event is followed by a celebration.
