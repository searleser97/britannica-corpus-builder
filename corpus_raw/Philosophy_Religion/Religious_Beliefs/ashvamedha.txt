Ashvamedha, (Sanskrit: “horse sacrifice”) also spelled ashwamedha,  grandest of the Vedic religious rites of ancient India, performed by a king to celebrate his paramountcy. The ceremony is described in detail in various Vedic writings, particularly the Shatapatha Brahmana. An especially fine stallion was selected and was allowed to roam freely for a year under the protection of a royal guard. If the horse entered a foreign country, its ruler had either to fight or to submit. If the horse was not captured during the year, it was victoriously brought back to the capital accompanied by the rulers of the lands it entered, and then sacrificed at a great public ceremony, which was accompanied by much feasting and celebration. The wandering horse was said to symbolize the Sun in its journey over the world and, consequently, the power of the king over the whole Earth. On successfully carrying out a horse sacrifice, the king could assume the title of chakravartin (universal monarch). The rite served not only to glorify the king but also to ensure the prosperity and fertility of the entire kingdom. Not all performances of the ashvamedha involved the actual killing of an animal, as indicated in the Shanti Parva, the 12th book of the ancient Sanskrit epic poem Mahabharata.
In historical times the practice was condemned by the Buddha and seems to have suffered a decline, but it was revived by Pushyamitra Shunga (reigned 187–151 bce). He is said to have defeated, while protecting his horse, Greek warriors who had reached the Punjab. Samudra Gupta (c. 330–c. 380 ce) issued coins in commemoration of his successful completion of an ashvamedha, and the rite is mentioned in connection with other Gupta and Chalukya monarchs. It may have continued as late as the 11th century, when it is said to have taken place during the Chola dynasty.
