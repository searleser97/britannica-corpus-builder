Chrismation,  (from Greek chriein, “to anoint”), in Eastern Christianity, sacrament that, together with baptism, introduces new members into the church. It is the Eastern equivalent of confirmation in the West. A priest anoints the forehead, eyes, nostrils, mouth, ears, breast, hands, and feet of the newly baptized with chrism (myron), a mixture of olive oil and balsam that is confected by the primates of the local churches, and says at each anointing, “The seal of the gift of the Holy Spirit.” The sacrament may also be administered to certain non-Orthodox Christians whose baptisms are recognized as valid when they are admitted into Orthodoxy and to lapsed Orthodox when they are readmitted to the church.
In Eastern Orthodoxy, the baptism of an infant is immediately followed by chrismation, and baptized and chrismed children are admitted to Holy Communion. Adult converts must typically enroll in catechism classes in order to prepare for the sacrament and usually receive baptism and/or chrismation on Holy Saturday. Adults who were previously baptized with a Trinitarian formula (i.e., “in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit”) by another Christian church that affirms the Trinity do not need to be rebaptized prior to their chrismation.
Chrismation is considered a personal “Pentecost” of each new member of the church, related to the anointing of kings and priests in the Old Testament. Through the gift of the Holy Spirit, each member of the new “people of God” shares in the prophecy, kingship, and priesthood of Christ, the Messiah.
