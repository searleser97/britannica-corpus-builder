Nikāya, (Sanskrit and Pāli: “group,” “class,” or “assemblage”)  in Buddhism, any of the so-called “Eighteen Schools” of Indian sectarian Buddhism. After the second Buddhist council, at which time the Mahāsaṅghikas separated from the Sthaviravādins, a number of Buddhist “schools” or “sects” began to appear over the course of many years. Each of these schools maintained slight (or sometimes greater) differences in doctrine, and each adhered to slightly different monastic codes. This early period of Buddhist history (prior to the formation of Mahāyāna Buddhism) with its proliferation of many different Buddhist sects and divisions of schools is often referred to as the period of “Nikāya Buddhism” or sectarian Buddhism. In addition, in Southeast Asian countries such as Burma and Thailand, Buddhist sects are still called nikāya.
A second meaning of the word nikāya refers not to a group or class of people, but to a group or assemblage of texts. The five major divisions of the Sutta Piṭaka of the Pāli canon are called nikāyas: Dīgha Nikāya (containing long suttas), Majjhima Nikāya (containing suttas of middle length), Saṃyutta Nikāya (containing suttas organized according to content), Aṅguttara Nikāya (containing suttas arranged according to the number of doctrinal items under discussion), and the Khuddaka Nikāya (containing suttas not included in any of the other four nikāyas).
