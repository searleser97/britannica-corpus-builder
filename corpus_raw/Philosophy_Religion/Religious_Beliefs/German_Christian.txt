German Christian,  any of the Protestants who attempted to subordinate church policy to the political initiatives of the German Nazi Party. The German Christians’ Faith Movement, organized in 1932, was nationalistic and so anti-Semitic that extremists wished to repudiate the Old Testament (Hebrew Bible) and the Pauline Letters because of their Jewish authorship. The movement acceded to the Nazi definition of a Jew based on the religion of his or her grandparents and to the racist principles embodied in the Nürnberg Laws of 1935. Thus, many practicing Christians whose families had converted a generation before were defined as Jews and excluded from the church.
In July 1933 the Protestant churches of the various German federal states merged to form the German Evangelical Church, and in September the German Christian candidate, Ludwig Müller, assumed leadership of the church as Reichsbischof (“Reich bishop”). Müller’s efforts to make the church an instrument of Nazi policy were resisted by the Confessing Church, under the leadership of Martin Niemöller. After World War II the German Christian Church Party was banned.
