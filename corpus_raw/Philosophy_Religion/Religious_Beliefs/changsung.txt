Changsŭng,   (Korean: “long life”), wooden or stone pole carved with a human face and placed at the entrance (and sometimes to the north, south, east, and west) of a Korean village or temple to frighten away evil spirits. Among rice-growing peasants, it is believed to be a guardian deity who can dispel evil and cure disease. It may also serve as a signpost showing distances or indicating boundaries.
The typical changsŭng is about 2 metres (6 feet) tall, with a red face in which eyes and teeth are prominent. The face may be male or female, and changsŭng are sometimes set in pairs. A male head wears a crown and surmounts an inscription reading “Great General Under the Sky” (Ch’ŏnhataejangkun); beneath a female face appears the title “Female General Under the Earth” (Chihayŏjangkun).
Similar to the changsŭng in spiritual significance, the somewhat taller sotdae, usually surmounted by a carved crane or duck, was often erected before a tomb or a house to commemorate the holder of a civil-service position during the Chosŏn dynasty (1392–1910).
