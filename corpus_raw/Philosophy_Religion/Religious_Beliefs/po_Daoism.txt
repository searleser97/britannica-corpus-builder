Po, Wade-Giles romanization p’o,  in Chinese Daoism, the seven earthly human souls as distinguished from the three heavenly hun souls. The distinction is based on the Chinese concept of yin-yang, the inescapable dual nature of all things. When the souls of a person are joined in harmonious union, health and life flourish; separation causes sickness and death. The Chinese assigned organic functions to po.
Although right order demands that the po (yin) souls be subservient to the hun (yang), in many cases the passions of po dominate people’s lives. Because the po souls can turn into a malevolent spirit (gui) if the deceased is not properly interred or sacrificed to, fitting burial rites not only ensure peaceful rest for the dead but further guarantee that the hun souls will impart special blessings to surviving family members.
