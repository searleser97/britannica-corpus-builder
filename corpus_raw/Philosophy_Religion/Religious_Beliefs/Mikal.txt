Mīkāl, also spelled Mīkāʾīl,  in Islam, archangel said to effectuate God’s rizq (providence) as well as natural phenomena, such as rain, and who is often paired with Jibrīl.  In Muslim legend, Mīkāl and Jibrīl were the first angels to obey God’s order to prostrate oneself before Adam. The two are further credited with purifying Muhammad’s heart before his night journey (Isrāʾ) from Mecca to Jerusalem and his subsequent ascension (Miʿrāj) to heaven. Mīkāl is also remembered as aiding the Muslims in their first significant military victory (Battle of Badr) in Arabia in 624. It is said that he was so shocked at the sight of hell when it was created that he never laughed again. In biblical literature Michael is the counterpart of Mīkāl.
The single allusion to Mīkāl in the Qurʾān (2:98) states: “Whoever is an enemy of God or his angels or his apostles or Jibrīl or Mīkāl: verily God is an enemy of the unbelievers,” a verse exegetes say was intended to address the Jews of Medina, who disbelieved in the Qurʾān’s revelation yet held Michael in particular esteem as “the lord of Israel.” According to one account, related by al-Qurṭubī (died 1273), Muhammad was questioned by the Jews of Medina about the origin of his prophetic mission. Upon responding that Jibrīl is the bearer of his revelations, the Jews replied that the archangel (called Gabriel in biblical literature) is an enemy who brings about war and suggested that Michael would be a more trustworthy bearer of revelation. Another report, related by al-Bayḍāwī (died 1280),  states that ʿUmar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb, curious why they disbelieved the revelations Gabriel had brought to Muhammad,  entered the synagogue of Medina and asked the Jews there how they regarded Gabriel. The Jews replied that Michael sat at God’s left and Gabriel at his right but that the two were enemies. Whereupon ʿUmar responded that an enemy of either angel was immediately an enemy of God.
