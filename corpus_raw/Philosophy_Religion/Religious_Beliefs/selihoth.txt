Selihoth, also spelled Selihot, orSelichot, Hebrew Seliḥot,  (“pardons”), in Jewish liturgy, penitential prayers originally composed for Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement) and for fast days but subsequently incorporated into other services. Selihoth have become an indispensable part of the Jewish liturgical services that precede Rosh Hashana (New Year), continue through the Ten Days of Penitence (ʿaseret yeme teshuva), and terminate on Yom Kippur.
The theme of all selihoth is the thirteen attributes of divine mercy that God taught to Moses (Exodus 34:6–7). Selihoth vary in form and emphasis, for each must be appropriate to the occasion on which it is recited. Typical selihoth dwell on God’s special relationship with Israel, on the sufferings of Jewish martyrs, or on the weakness of human nature. The phrasing may include, for example, a confession of sins and a petition to God for mercy; or it may beg God to accept prayer in place of the ancient temple sacrifices.
