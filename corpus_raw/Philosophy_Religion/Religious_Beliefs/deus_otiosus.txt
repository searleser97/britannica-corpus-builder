Deus otiosus,   (Latin: “neutral god,” or “hidden god”), in the history of religions and philosophy, a high god who has withdrawn from the immediate details of the governing of the world. The god has delegated all work on Earth to ancestors or nature spirits, who act as mediators between the god and humans. This concept of god occurs widely in Africa, Melanesia, and South America.
In Western philosophy, the deus otiosus concept has been attributed to deism, a 17th–18th-century Western rationalistic religio-philosophical movement, in its view of a nonintervening creator of the universe. Although this stark interpretation was accepted by very few deists during the period in which they flourished, many of their antagonists attempted to force them into the position of stating that after the original act of creation God virtually withdrew and refrained from interfering in the processes of nature and human affairs.
