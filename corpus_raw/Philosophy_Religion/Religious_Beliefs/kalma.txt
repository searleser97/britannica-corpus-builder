Kalma,  in Finno-Ugric religion, Finnish term referring to the dead and used in compound words with concepts associated with the dead. Related words are similarly used in other Uralic languages, such as kalmo (“grave”) among the Mordvin and halmer (“corpse”) among the Samoyed. In Finnish, kalmanväki means both the spirits of the dead and the collective power inherent in them that can be used by a shaman to work sorcery against other people. Kalmanväki are believed to be ruled by the ghost of the first person buried in a cemetery, who becomes its guardian spirit, or haltia.
Among many Finno-Ugric peoples the dead were buried in village cemeteries with consecrated fir groves. Finns had a custom, called karsikko, of stripping a tall fir or pine tree in memory of the dead and making offerings to it. The Cheremis were also known to put presents on the trees for the dead. A karsikko made somewhere between the former home of the deceased and the cemetery prevented the soul of the deceased from returning. The Finno-Ugrians, as did the Finns, considered the dead a hostile and dangerous force against which the living had to take precautions.
