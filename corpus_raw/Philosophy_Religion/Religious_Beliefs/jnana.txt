Jnana, (Sanskrit: “knowledge”)  in Hindu philosophy, a word with a range of meanings focusing on a cognitive event that proves not to be mistaken. In the religious realm it especially designates the sort of knowledge that is a total experience of its object, particularly the supreme being or reality. The cognitive experience of the supreme object sets the soul free from the transmigratory life and the polarities this imposes upon thought. Its opposite, ajnana (also called avidya), is the false apprehension of reality that keeps the soul from attaining release; it is a form of mistaken knowledge, which has a large measure of validity as far as the realities of the present world are concerned but conceals the truth of a reality outside it.
In the Bhagavadgita, jnana Yoga (“the discipline of knowledge”) is recognized as one of three complementary paths to religious fulfillment. It centres on the recognition of the distinction between the perduring self and its transitory embodiments, a recognition fundamentally facilitated by the presence of the divine Krishna, who reorients the knowledge of his doubting interlocutor and ultimate devotee, Arjuna.
