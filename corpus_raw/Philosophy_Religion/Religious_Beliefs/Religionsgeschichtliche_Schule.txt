Religionsgeschichtliche Schule, (German: “history of religions school”)  in the study of religion and particularly in the study of biblical literature, an approach that emphasized the degree to which the Bible and the ideas contained within it were the products of their cultural milieu. Developed within German biblical studies of the 19th century, the religionsgeschichtliche Schule drew upon the emergence earlier in the century of the so-called “higher criticism,” which applied historical criticism, form criticism, and other methodologies to the study of the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) and the New Testament.
In the last quarter of the 19th century, the German biblical scholar Julius Wellhausen published his documentary hypothesis of the composition of the Hebrew Scriptures. Rather than assume their historical accuracy, Wellhausen identified four different authorial perspectives, each of which emphasized a particular aspect of ancient Israelite religious life or a distinct historical tradition within it. Meanwhile, the faculty of theology at the University of Göttingen focused upon the New Testament and studied the influence of various ancient religious and philosophical traditions on the emergence of Christianity. Scholars such as Albert Eichhorn and Ernst Troeltsch strove to demonstrate that Christianity’s customs and dogmas developed over time and in response to socioeconomic factors as well as influences from other traditions—in particular, Hellenistic Judaism and the religions of the Roman Empire. The notable feature characterizing the work of the Göttingen scholars is that Christianity is viewed as only one religion among others; as such, it can lay no claim to absolute truth. Indeed, in its emergence and evolution, Christianity demonstrates characteristics that all religions share.
