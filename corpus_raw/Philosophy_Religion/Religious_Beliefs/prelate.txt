Prelate,   an ecclesiastical dignitary of high rank. In the modern Roman Catholic church, prelates are those who exercise the public power of the church. True prelacy is defined as “preeminence with jurisdiction,” and true, or real, prelates are distinguished as (1) greater prelates, those who possess episcopal jurisdiction (such as patriarchs, archbishops, and bishops), and (2) lesser prelates, those who possess a quasi-episcopal or other jurisdiction (such as abbots and prelates “of no diocese” and religious superiors, withdrawn from the ordinary diocesan jurisdiction).
In some Protestant churches the title of prelate was retained after the Reformation. The Church of England restricts it to bishops.
