Isrāfīl,   in Islam, the archangel who will blow the trumpet from the holy rock in Jerusalem (see Dome of the Rock) to announce the Day of Resurrection. The trumpet is constantly poised at his lips, ready to be blown when God so orders.
Though not mentioned in the Qurʾān, Isrāfīl is known from Hadith and tafsīr literature. He is usually conceived as having a huge hairy body that is covered with mouths and tongues and that reaches from the seventh heaven to the throne of God. One wing protects his body, another shields him from God, while the other two extend east and west. He is overcome by sorrow and tears three times every day and every night at the sight of hell. It is said that Isrāfīl tutored Muhammad for three years in the duties of a prophet before he could receive the Qurʾān. Isrāfīl has no clear counterpart in the Judeo-Christian tradition, though some scholars have drawn connections to Raphael, Uriel, or Seraphiel.
