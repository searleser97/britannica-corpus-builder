Thirteen Articles of Faith, also called Thirteen Principles,  a summary of the basic tenets of Judaism as perceived by the 12th-century Jewish philosopher Moses Maimonides. They first appeared in his commentary on the Mishna, Kitāb al-Sirāj, as an elaboration on the section Sanhedrin 10, which sets forth the reasons why a Jew would be denied resurrection. Maimonides’ formulation was an attempt to put forth true concepts of God and faith as a tool in avoiding error. His statement, although presented by him as a form of dogma, was a personal concept and has been much debated and revised. The numerous versions of the Articles of Faith include the hymn Yigdal, written about 1300 and adopted into most prayer services.
