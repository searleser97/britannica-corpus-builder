Märchen, plural Märchen,  folktale characterized by elements of magic or the supernatural, such as the endowment of a mortal character with magical powers or special knowledge; variations expose the hero to supernatural beings or objects. The German term Märchen, used universally by folklorists, also embraces tall tales and humorous anecdotes; although it is often translated as “fairy tale,” the fairy is not a requisite motif.
Märchen usually begin with a formula such as “once upon a time,” setting the story in an indefinite time and place. Their usual theme is the triumph over difficulty, with or without supernatural aid, of the one least likely to succeed. The characters are stylized—wicked stepmothers, stupid ogres, or handsome princes. The situations are familiar to the listeners; i.e., European Märchen reflect the economic and domestic arrangements of peasants and simple workmen, such as millers, tailors, or smiths. Those of ancient origin may reflect archaic social conditions, such as matriarchy, primitive birth and marriage customs, or old forms of inheritance. The hero, however poor or friendless, has easy access to the king and may, through luck, cleverness, or magic information, win the king’s daughter in marriage and automatically inherit the kingdom.
Versions of these stories, sometimes almost identical, have been found all over the world. Their origin is unknown. They have been subjected to literary reworking from very early times. Interest in the serious study of Märchen developed in the early 19th century. The first systematic attempt to transcribe and record them verbatim from oral tradition was the collection Kinder-und Hausmärchen (1812–15) of the Brothers Grimm, popularly known as Grimm’s Fairy Tales. See also fairy tale.
