Tahajjud,   (Arabic: “keeping vigil”), in Islāmic practice, the recitation of the Qurʾān (Islāmic scriptures) and prayers during the night. Tahajjud is generally regarded as sunnah (tradition) and not farḍ (obligation). There are many verses in the Qurʾān that encourage these nightly recitations and other verses that indicate such practices should remain “a voluntary effort” (17:79). Pious Muslims everywhere perform tahajjud as a form of asceticism in imitation of the Prophet Muḥammad, who continued nightly vigils even after the institution of the five daily prayers. In fiqh (Islāmic jurisprudence), it is considered blameworthy to prevent those who desire to do so from practicing tahajjud as much as they wish. According to one tradition, tahajjud “loosens the knots that Satan ties in the hair of a sleeper.” During Ramaḍān (the Muslim month of fasting) tahajjud is considered particularly meritorious, so Muslims often spend these nights in mosques praying and reciting the Qurʾān until dawn. In some Muslim countries an official nighttime adhān (call for prayer) has been instituted.
