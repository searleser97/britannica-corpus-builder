Mitre, also spelled miter,  liturgical headdress worn by Roman Catholic bishops and abbots and some Anglican and Lutheran bishops. It has two shield-shaped stiffened halves that face the front and back. Two fringed streamers, known as lappets, hang from the back. It developed from the papal tiara and came into use in the 11th century.
Three types of mitres are worn in the Roman Catholic Church. The simplex is made of undecorated white linen or silk and is worn at funerals, Good Friday, and some other services. The auriphrygiata is made of plain gold cloth or white silk with gold or silver embroidered bands and is worn during penitential seasons and at some other times. The pretiosa is decorated with precious stones and gold and worn on Sundays and feast days.
The Greek mitra worn by bishops and some Russian clergy in the Eastern churches is similar to a closed crown with a cross on top.
