Bhut, Hindi bhūt,  in Hindu mythology, a restless ghost. Bhuts are believed to be malignant if they have died a violent death or have been denied funeral rites; they are particularly feared by women, children, and the newly married.
Bhuts haunt trees, deserts, abandoned houses, the hearths and roofs of homes, crossroads, and boundaries but never rest on the ground. Rudimentary shrines are sometimes established for bhuts, and when in fear of them a believer will invoke Śiva, as he is considered to be their lord.
