Guru, (Sanskrit: “venerable”)  in Hinduism, a personal spiritual teacher or guide. From at least the mid-1st millennium bce, when the Upanishads (speculative commentaries on the Vedas, the revealed scriptures of Hinduism) were composed, India has stressed the importance of the tutorial method in religious instruction. In the educational system of ancient India, knowledge of the Vedas was personally transmitted through oral teachings from the guru to his pupil (pupils were always male in that period). Classically, the pupil lived at the home of his guru and served him with obedience and devotion.
Later, with the rise of the bhakti movement, which stressed devotion to a personalized deity, the guru was venerated as the leader or founder of any of a number of sects (many of which now included women and some of which had women gurus). The guru was also considered to be the living embodiment of the spiritual truth professed by the sect and thus was identified with the deity. In at least one sect, the Vallabhacharya, the devotee was instructed to offer mind, body, and property to the guru. The tradition of willing service and obedience to the guru is still observed. The guru is frequently treated with the same respect paid the deity during worship, and the guru’s birthday is celebrated by his followers as a festival day.
Religious self-instruction is considered inefficacious. It is the guru who prescribes spiritual disciplines and who, at the time of initiation, instructs the student in the use of the mantra (sacred formula) to assist in meditation. The example of the guru who, though human, has achieved spiritual enlightenment leads the devotee to discover the same potentialities within himself.
