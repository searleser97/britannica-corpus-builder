P’ungsuchirisol,  (Korean: “theory of wind, water, and land”), in Korean religion, geomancy, a belief that the natural environment of a particular location can influence the fortune of its inhabitants and descendants. It derives from the Chinese notion of feng-shui (“wind-water”), which developed from observation of chronic catastrophies wrought in China by winds and floods. Also implied is the Chinese concept of yinyang (two contrary but complementary principles that explain all change) and the doctrine of the five elements that constitute all reality.
According to p’ungsuchirisol, each plot of land possesses two of four attributes: that which has wang (“prosperous”) and sŏn (“right”), for example, is fit for graves, houses, and important buildings; that which has shoe (“decay”) and yŏk (“reversion”) is propitious for temples. A good site for buildings and graves is marked by a majestic mountain linked to smaller mountains trailing off into the distance. The site also should be flanked on the left by a mountain shaped like the Blue Dragon (protector of good fortune) and on the right by one shaped like the White Tiger (expeller of evil). Finally, a mountain behind the site should face another distant mountain. A hill that resembles a cow lying down to eat fodder will secure a life free from worry about food and lodging. A site resembling a hen sitting on eggs will be the birthplace of great men.
Three types of sites are to be avoided: a place close to a road with heavy traffic, a town whose ditches overflow during the rainy season, and a spot where dragon- and tiger-shaped mountains come together.
Yi Sŏng-gye, founder of the Chosŏn (Yi) dynasty (1392–1910), moved the national capital to Seoul because the site was said by a monk to fulfill all the requirements of p’ungsuchirisol.
