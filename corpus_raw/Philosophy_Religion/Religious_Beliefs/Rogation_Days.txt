Rogation Days,  in the Roman Catholic Church, festival days devoted to special prayers for crops. They comprise the Major Rogation (Major Litany) on April 25 and the Minor Rogations (Minor Litany) on the three days before the feast of the Ascension (40th day after Easter).
The Major Rogation (from Latin rogare, “to ask [for God’s blessings and mercy]”) originated as a Christian festival to supplant a pagan Roman festival, Robigalia, which consisted of a procession from Rome to a point outside the city, where a dog and a sheep were sacrificed to save the crops from blight (robigo, “wheat rust”). According to a document of Pope Gregory I, the Christian festival was established as an annual event by the year 598. The Christian procession followed the same route as the pagan procession for a certain distance and then turned off and returned to St. Peter’s Basilica, where mass was celebrated.
The Minor Rogations were first introduced in Gaul by St. Mamertus of Vienne about the year 470 and were made binding for all of Gaul by the first Council of Orléans (511). Later (c. 800) the festival days were adopted in Rome by Pope Leo III. It is possible that Mamertus first instituted the Minor Rogations to replace three days of pagan crop processions called the Ambarvalia. The Minor Rogations were traditionally observed with processional litanies and fasting as a supplication for clement weather for the crops and deliverance from pestilence and famine. In 1969 the Minor Rogations were changed to votive masses.
