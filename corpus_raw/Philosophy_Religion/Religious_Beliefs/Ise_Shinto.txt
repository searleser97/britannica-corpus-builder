Ise Shintō, also called Watarai Shintō,  school of Shintō established by priests of the Watarai family who served at the Outer Shrine of the Ise Shrine (Ise-jingū). Ise Shintō establishes purity and honesty as the highest virtues, realizable through religious experience.
The school began in the Kamakura period (1192–1333) as an attempt to emancipate Shintō from the domination of Buddhist thought (for example, it reversed the Buddhist teaching of the period and declared that the Buddhas and bodhisattvas, or Buddhas-to-be, were manifestations of Shintō kami). Later, Confucian elements were added. The theology of Ise Shintō was summarized in a five-volume apologia, the Shintō gobusho, which appeared in the 13th century.
