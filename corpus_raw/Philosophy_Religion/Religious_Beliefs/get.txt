Get, also spelled Gett, Hebrew Geṭ (“bill of divorce”), plural Gittin,  Jewish document of divorce written in Aramaic according to a prescribed formula. Orthodox and Conservative Jews recognize it as the only valid instrument for severing a marriage bond. Rabbinic courts outside Israel, recognizing the need to comply with civil laws regulating divorce and settlements, require a civil divorce before a get is issued. Reform Jews disregard Talmudic divorce laws and hence require no get but simply accept the ruling of a civil divorce court as sufficient in itself.
A religious divorce becomes effective when the husband, having obtained a get from a rabbinic court, drops the document into the cupped hands of his willing wife in the presence of two witnesses and the three members of the court. The court officials are present to ensure that religious law has been properly observed. They then record the divorce and issue documents to the man and woman.
Though, strictly speaking, Jewish religious law permits a man to divorce his wife at any time for any reason, women have long been granted equal rights with men. Their rights are protected by stipulations written into the marriage contract (ketubah), and, since the 11th century, divorce has not been granted in the Ashkenazi (German) rite without the wife’s consent. In practice, therefore, the only basic requirement for divorce is the mutual consent of husband and wife.
Under certain special circumstances, such as apostasy, impotence, insanity, or refusal to cohabit, Jewish law entitles one party to compel the other to agree to a divorce.
