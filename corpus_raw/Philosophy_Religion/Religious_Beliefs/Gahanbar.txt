Gahanbar,   in Zoroastrianism, any of six festivals, occurring at irregular intervals throughout the year, which celebrate the seasons and possibly the six stages in the creation of the world (the heavens, water, the earth, the vegetable world, the animal world, and man). Each lasting five days, the Gahanbars are: Maidhyaōizaremaya (Midspring), occurring in the month of Artavahisht, 41 days after the New Year; 60 days later is Maidhyoishema (Midsummer), in the month of Tīr; 75 days later, Paitishhahya (Harvest-time), in the month of Shatvairō; 30 days later, Ayāthrima (possibly Time of Prosperity), in the month of Mitrā; 80 days later, Maidhyāirya (Midwinter), in the month of Dīn; and 75 days later, in the last five intercalary or Gatha days of the year, Hamaspathmaēdaya (Vernal Equinox).
Parsis observe the Gahanbar festivals in two stages. Four liturgical rites are first celebrated: the Āfringān, being prayers of love or praise; the Bāj, prayers honouring yazatas (angels) or fravashis (guardian spirits); the Yasna, the central Zoroastrian rite, which includes the sacrifice of the sacred liquor, haoma; and the Pavi, prayers honouring God and his spirits, performed jointly by the priest and the faithful. A solemn feast then follows, in which the sacrifical offerings made in the preceding liturgies are consumed in ritual purity.
