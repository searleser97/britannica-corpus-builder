Church of God (Anderson, Indiana),  Christian fellowship that considers itself a “reformation movement” among Christians and not a church or sect; it accepts its title for identification purposes only. Its members believe that they have organized themselves to carry on the work of the church, but they do not believe they have organized the church, which is made up of all Christians and cannot be limited to human organizations.
The fellowship developed from the work of Daniel Sidney Warner, a minister of the General Eldership of the Churches of God in North America. In 1881 Warner and five others left that church and began the new movement, an open fellowship of a community of believers not restricted by creeds or organizations. The fellowship, Warner believed, reestablished the situation of the very early Christians. The movement in its early days opposed all human organization, but this hampered its growth. Gradually it was realized that the work of the church, but not the Church of God, must be organized.
In theology Warner and his associates were essentially followers of John Wesley and the early Methodists. The use of tobacco and alcoholic beverages and participation in “worldly pleasures,” such as dancing and the theatre, were forbidden. The Church of God is considered to be one of the Holiness churches, which stress the doctrine of sanctification, a postconversion experience that enables the person to live a sinless life.
The Church of God has a congregational system of church government, and ministers belong to state and regional assemblies. A general ministerial assembly and a convention meet annually in Anderson, Indiana, U.S., the headquarters of the movement. In 1997 the group reported 229,302 members and 2,347 congregations.
