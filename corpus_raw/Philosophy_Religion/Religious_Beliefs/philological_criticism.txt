Philological criticism,  method of biblical criticism consisting mainly in the study of the biblical languages in their widest scope, so that the vocabulary, grammar, and style of biblical writings can be understood as accurately as possible. It includes the study of writings, both scriptural and nonscriptural, in the languages in which the Bible was originally composed—Hebrew, Aramaic, and Koine (“Hellenistic”) Greek—and in cognate languages.
