High place, Hebrew Bamah, or Bama,  Israelite or Canaanite open-air shrine usually erected on an elevated site. Prior to the conquest of Canaan (Palestine) by the Israelites in the 12th–11th century bc, the high places served as shrines of the Canaanite fertility deities, the Baals (Lords) and the Asherot (Semitic goddesses). In addition to an altar, matztzevot (stone pillars representing the presence of the divine) and asherim (upright wooden poles symbolizing the female deities) often were erected on the high places, which sometimes were located under a tree or grove of trees. Other accoutrements sometimes associated with the bamah were ḥammanim, small incense altars. The high place at Megiddo in Israel is one of the oldest known high places, dating from about 2500 bc.
Because the Israelites had associated the divine presence with elevated places (e.g., Mount Sinai), they used Canaanite high places to worship their own God, Yahweh. Canaanite agricultural fertility rites and practices were adopted by the previously nomadic Israelites, often in a syncretic fashion with Yahweh replacing Baal. A strong reaction to the adoption of such rites led to protests by Israelite judges and prophets from the 12th to the late 7th century bc, when the Deuteronomic Reform of 621 led to the extirpation of the many local high places as sites of worship. The Temple at Jerusalem on Mount Zion thus became the only legitimate high place in the Israelite religion, and the name bamah became a term of reproach and contempt.
