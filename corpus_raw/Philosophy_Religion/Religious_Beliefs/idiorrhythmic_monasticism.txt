Idiorrhythmic monasticism, also called eremitic monasticism (from Greek eremos, “desert”),  the original form of monastic life in Christianity, as exemplified by St. Anthony of Egypt (c. 250–355). It consisted of a total withdrawal from society, normally in the desert, and the constant practice of mental prayer. The contemplative and mystical trend of eremitic monasticism is also known as Hesychasm. In the Christian East, the “idiorrhythmic” system (from Greek idios, “particular”; rhythmos, “rule,” or “discipline”) always coexisted with cenobitic monasticism. It is still practiced on modern Mount Athos, Greece. See also cenobitic monasticism.
