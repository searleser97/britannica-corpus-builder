Rāfiḍah,   (Arabic: “Rejectors”), broadly, Shīʿite Muslims who reject (rafḍ) the caliphate of Muḥammad’s two successors Abū Bakr and ʿUmar. Many Muslim scholars, however, have stated that the term Rāfiḍah cannot be applied to the Shīʿites in general but only to the extremists among them who believe in the divine right of ʿAlī to succeed Muḥammad and who condemn Abū Bakr and ʿUmar as unlawful rulers of the Muslim community. The Rāfiḍah were also considered by some to be one of three main groups that compose the Shīʿites, the other two being the Ghulāt and the Zaydīyah.
To the majority of the Shīʿites, who do not condemn Muḥammad’s immediate successors and only assert ʿAlī’s right to the caliphate over Muʿāwiyah (the first Umayyad caliph), the term Rāfiḍah is pejorative, coined by their opponents to cast the shadow of extremism on them.
