Vallabhacharya, also spelled Vallabhacarya, also called Vallabha Sampradaya or Pushtimarg,  school of Hinduism prominent among the merchant class of northern and western India. Its members are worshippers of Krishna and followers of the Pushtimarg (“Way of Flourishing”) group, founded by the 16th-century teacher Vallabha and his son Vitthala (also known as Gosainji).
The worship of the sect centres on the adventures of the youthful Krishna, whose amorous play with the gopis (wives and daughters of the cowherds) of Vrindavana are described in the 10th book of the Sanskrit classic the Bhagavata-purana. Special festivals celebrate the different seasons of the year, the events of Krishna’s life, and the birth anniversaries of Vallabha and Vitthala. Participation in the highest form of bhakti (devotion) is attainable only through divine grace (pushti, literally “nourishment”); personal efforts such as good deeds or religious observances are not essential.
The Vallabhacharya sect is renowned for the degree of devotion paid its gurus (spiritual leaders), who are considered earthly embodiments of the god. Vallabha was succeeded as leader of the sect by Vitthala and he in turn by his seven sons, each of whom established his own separate temple. The group’s leaders are descendants of the seven sons of Vitthala and are addressed by the title Maharaja or Maharaja Gosainji.
The main temple of the sect is at Nathdwara, in Rajasthan state, where there is a distinctive image of Krishna called Shri-Nathaji. According to the tradition of the sect, Shri-Nathaji revealed itself to Vallabha when he was visiting Mount Govardhana, a scene of one of the Krishna’s exploits.
