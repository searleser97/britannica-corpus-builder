Hail Mary, Latin Ave Maria, also called Angelic Salutation,  a principal prayer of the Roman Catholic Church, comprising three parts, addressed to the Virgin Mary. The prayer is recited in the Rosary of the Blessed Virgin (see rosary) and is often assigned as penance during the sacrament of reconciliation (confession). The following is the Latin text:
The English translation is as follows:
The first part, the words of the archangel Gabriel (Luke 1:28), appears in liturgies as early as the 6th century. The second part, the words of Elizabeth, the mother of St. John the Baptist (Luke 1:42), was added to the first part by about 1000 ce, the appositive Jesus being added some two centuries later, possibly by Pope Urban IV (reigned 1261â€“64). The closing petition came into general use during the 14th or 15th century and received its official formulation in the reformed breviary of Pope Pius V in 1568.
Of the many musical settings of the prayer, the Ave Maria of Franz Schubert is perhaps the most widely known.
