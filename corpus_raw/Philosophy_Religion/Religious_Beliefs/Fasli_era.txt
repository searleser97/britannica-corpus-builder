Faṣlī era,  chronological system devised by the Mughal emperor Akbar for land revenue purposes in northern India, for which the Muslim lunar calendar was inconvenient. Faṣlī (“harvest”) is derived from the Arabic term for “division,” which in India was applied to the groupings of the seasons. The era dated from Akbar’s accession year, the Muslim year ah 963 (1555–56 ce). This was also the Hindu Samvat era year 1612. Akbar arbitrarily took 649 years from the Samvat year in order to make the Faṣlī year 963. Thereafter, the Faṣlī era proceeded according to the Samvat calendar. (To transpose Faṣlī into Gregorian, or New Style, calendar dates, add 592/593 years.) The system was introduced into the Deccan (southern India) by Shah Jahān in the 1630s.
