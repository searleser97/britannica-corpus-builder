Shruti, (Sanskrit: “What Is Heard”)  in Hinduism, the most-revered body of sacred literature, considered to be the product of divine revelation. Shruti works are considered to have been heard and transmitted by earthly sages, as contrasted to Smriti, or that which is remembered by ordinary human beings. Though Shruti is considered to be the more authoritative, in practice the Smriti texts are more influential in modern Hinduism. The revealed texts encompass the four Vedas—Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda, and Atharvaveda—and the Brahmanas (ritual treatises), the Aranyakas (“Forest Books”), and the Upanishads (philosophical elaborations on the Vedas that form the basis of much of later Hindu philosophy and theology).
