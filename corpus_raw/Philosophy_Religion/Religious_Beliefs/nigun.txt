Nigun,   wordless song sung by á¸¤asidic Jews as a means of elevating the soul to God. Because they lacked words, the nigunim were felt to move the singer beyond the sensual and rational toward the mystic. Such songs were spontaneously extemporized by a rabbi or one of his disciples, the entire group of men then repeating the song in unison. Melodically, the songs are strongly influenced by Slavic folk song, but they are freer in rhythm.
In the 18th century, when persecutions caused many eastern European Jews to migrate to western Europe, the nigunim were often appropriated by cantors who sought to combine them with western European musical styles; only rarely were such combinations truly successful. A number of nigunim have been preserved in musical notation.
