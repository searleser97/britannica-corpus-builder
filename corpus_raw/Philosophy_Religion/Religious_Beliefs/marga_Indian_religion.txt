Marga, (Sanskrit: “path”)  in Indian religions, a path toward, or way of reaching, salvation. The epic Bhagavadgita (or Gita) describes  jnana-marga, the way of knowledge (study of philosophical texts and contemplation); karma-marga, the way of action (proper performance of one’s religious and ethical duties); and bhakti-marga, the way of devotion and self-surrender to God. In the Gita the god Krishna praises all three means but favours bhakti-marga, which was accessible to members of any class or caste.
In Buddhism, the Eightfold Path (Sanskrit: Astangika-marga; Pali: Atthangika-magga), a doctrine taught by the Buddha in his first sermon, is a fundamental teaching. It is also called the Middle Way, because it steers a course between the extremes of self-gratification and self-mortification. Those who follow the Eightfold Path are said to be freed from the suffering that is an essential part of human existence and are led ultimately to nirvana, or enlightenment.
