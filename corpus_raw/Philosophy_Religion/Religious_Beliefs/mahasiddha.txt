Mahasiddha, (Sanskrit: “great perfect one”)  Tibetan Grub-thob Chen,  in the Tantric, or esoteric, traditions of India and Tibet, a person who, by the practice of meditative disciplines, has attained siddha (miraculous powers); a great magician.
Both the Shaivites (followers of Shiva) of Hindu India and the Tantric Buddhists of Tibet preserve legends of 84 mahasiddhas who flourished up to the 11th century. (The number 84 is a conventional, mystical number representing totality.) The lists of names vary considerably. All classes of society and both sexes are represented, and many non-Indian names appear.
The 84 mahasiddhas continue to be revered in Tibet. They are the authors of many Tantric works and are the originators of spiritual lines of descent—from master to disciple—still honoured. The most famous of the Tibetan mahasiddhas is the great 8th-century Tantric master Padmasambhava.
One text lists the eight “great powers,” or siddhas, as the power of shrinking to the size of an atom; of becoming light enough to fly through the air; of becoming heavy; of touching faraway objects, even as distant as the moon; of irresistible will; of supremacy over the body and mind; of having dominion over the elements; and of instantaneously fulfilling all desires.
