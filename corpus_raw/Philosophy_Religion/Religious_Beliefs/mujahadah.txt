Mujāhadah,  (Arabic: “striving”), in Sufism, struggle with the carnal self; the word is related to jihad (struggle), which is often understood as “holy war.” The Sufis refer to mujāhadah as al-jihād al-akbar (the greater war) in contrast to al-jihād al-aṣghar (the minor war), which is waged against unbelievers. It is one of the major duties that a Sufi must perform throughout his mystical journey toward union with God.
All acts of penance and austerity, such as prolonged fasts and abstinence from the comforts of life, have become part of the mujāhadah practice. Some Sufis have gone beyond mere bodily torture to the extreme of self-immolation. Such excesses, however, are frowned upon by most Sufis. The purpose of mujāhadah is to conquer the temptations of the self in order to purify one’s soul and bring one’s soul to a state of readiness to receive the divine light.
