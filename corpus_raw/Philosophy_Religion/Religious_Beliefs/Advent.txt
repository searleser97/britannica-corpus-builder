Advent,  (from Latin adventus, “coming”), in the Christian church calendar, the period of preparation for the celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ at Christmas and also of preparation for the Second Coming of Christ. In Western churches, Advent begins on the Sunday nearest to November 30 (St. Andrew’s Day) and is the beginning of the liturgical year. In many Eastern churches, the Nativity Fast is a similar period of penance and preparation that occurs during the 40 days before Christmas. The date when the season was first observed is uncertain. Bishop Perpetuus of Tours (461–490) established a fast before Christmas that began on November 11 (St. Martin’s Day), and the Council of Tours (567) mentioned an Advent season.
The liturgical meaning of the Advent season referred to the dual “coming” of Jesus—then Roman Catholicism the traditional liturgical colour for Advent is violet; many Protestant denominations have adopted blue or purple. The third Sunday of Advent, known as Gaudete Sunday, is commonly marked by the use of rose-coloured vestments and candles.
