Tanna, also spelled Tana (Aramaic: “teacher”), plural Tannaim, or Tanaim,  any of several hundred Jewish scholars who, over a period of some 200 years, compiled oral traditions related to religious law. Most tannaim lived and worked in Palestine. Their work was given final form early in the 3rd century ad by Judah ha-Nasi, whose codification of oral laws became known as the Mishna (q.v.). Some scholars believe the Mishna was committed to writing at this time, while others believe it was preserved solely by memory for another three or four centuries.
The tannaim were succeeded by other scholars, called amoraim (“interpreters” or “reciters”) who, in Palestine and Babylonia, wrote extensive commentaries (Gemara) on the Mishna. The Palestinian and Babylonian Talmuds thus have the same Mishnaic content but significantly different Gemara.
