Jaina canon,   the sacred texts of Jainism, a religion of India, whose authenticity is disputed between sects. The Svetambara canon consists principally of 45 works divided as follows: (1) 11 Aṅgas, the main texts—a 12th has been lost for at least 14 centuries; (2) 12 Upāṅgas, or subsidiary texts; (3) 10 Prakīrṇakas, or assorted texts; (4) 6 Cheda-sutras on the rules of ascetic life; (5) 2 Cūlikā-sutras on cognition and epistemology; and (6) 4 Mūla-sutras on miscellaneous topics. Svetambara, however, originally accepted a canon of 71 works said to derive from a 5th-century religious Council of Valabhī.
The Svetambara works cover a variety of topics, including a list of the Tirthankaras, or Jinas (Jaina saviours), exploits and teachings of these figures, and doctrines. Some of the Aṅgas contain supposed dialogues between Mahāvīra, the most recent Tirthankara, and his followers. Others are said to retain some of the earliest parts of the canon, which appears to have been preserved originally in oral form. The canon is written in the Prākrit dialect, though from the Gupta period (4th–6th century ad) Jaina writers have used Sanskrit for a wider audience.
The Digambara sect disputes the authenticity of the entire Svetambara canon. The Digambara believe that the original is lost but that the substance of Jaina doctrine has been preserved in a variety of religious and philosophic texts written by various leaders and scholars of the Jaina community over the centuries.
