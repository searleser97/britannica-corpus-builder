Antiochene rite, also called West Syrian rite,  the system of liturgical practices and discipline observed by Syrian Monophysites (Jacobites), the Malabar Christians of Kerala, India (Jacobites), and three Eastern-rite communities of the Roman Catholic church: Catholic Syrians, Maronites, and Malankarese Christians of Kerala. The Antiochene rite is sometimes called the West Syrian rite to distinguish it from the Chaldean, or East Syrian, rite.
The Antiochene rite, which served as the earliest model for almost all Eastern rites, originated in the patriarchate of Antioch and later generated the Byzantine and Alexandrian rites. The Liturgy of St. James evolved from the Jerusalemâ€“Antioch liturgy and is currently used in modified form by both Catholic and Jacobite Syrians and Maronites.
