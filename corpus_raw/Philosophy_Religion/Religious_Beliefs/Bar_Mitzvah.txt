Bar mitzvah, also spelled bar mitzva or mitzwa (Hebrew: “son of the commandment”), plural bar mitzvahs, bar mitzvot, or bar mitzwot,  Jewish religious ritual and family celebration commemorating the religious adulthood of a boy on his 13th birthday. The boy, now deemed personally responsible for fulfilling all the commandments, may henceforth don phylacteries (religious symbols worn on the forehead and left arm) during the weekday morning prayers and may be counted as an adult whenever 10 male adults are needed to form a quorum (minyan) for public prayers.
In a public act of acknowledging religious majority, the boy is called up during the religious service to read from the Torah. This event may take place on any occasion following the 13th birthday at which the Torah is read but generally occurs on the Sabbath. The liturgy of the day thus permits the boy to read the weekly text from the Prophets, called Haftarah. This is sometimes followed by a hortatory discourse. After the religious ceremony, there is often a festive kiddush, or prayer over a cup of wine, with a family social dinner or banquet on the same or the following day.
Though records of the 2nd century mention 13 as the age of religious manhood, most elements of the bar mitzvah celebration did not appear until the Middle Ages. Reform Judaism replaced bar mitzvah, after 1810, with the confirmation of boys and girls together, generally on the feast of Shavuot. In the 20th century, however, many Reform congregations restored bar mitzvah, delaying confirmation until the age of 15 or 16. Numerous Conservative and Reform congregations have instituted a separate ceremony to mark the adulthood of girls, called bat mitzvah.
