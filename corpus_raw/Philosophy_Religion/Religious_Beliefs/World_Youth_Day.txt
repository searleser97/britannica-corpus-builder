World Youth Day,  program of religious education and spiritual formation for youth in the Roman Catholic Church. Pope John Paul II was inspired to establish World Youth Day in 1986 by the church’s Youth Jubilee (1984), a special meeting between the pope and young Catholics held at the conclusion of the 1983–84 Year of Jubilee, and by the United Nations International Youth Year (1985). The first World Youth Day, held on Palm Sunday in Rome, had the goal of assuring young Catholics of their capacity to perpetuate the church’s traditions, spirituality, and work within the world.
Since 1987 World Youth Day has been celebrated annually on Palm Sunday in every diocese. Every few years, however, it becomes an international pilgrimage to a major world city, where there is a weeklong program of spiritual activity that integrates catechism, public rituals—including a mass reenactment of the Stations of the Cross—and performing arts. The program is inaugurated by the completion of the “Journey of the Cross and Icon,” in which young pilgrims transport from Rome to the celebration site a wooden cross and an image of the Virgin Mary, both donated by John Paul II “to the youth of the world.” The celebration culminates in a Sunday mass led by the pope.
International World Youth Days have been held in such cities as Buenos Aires (1987), Manila (1995), Sydney (2008), and Kraków (2016). Estimated attendance at the final mass has ranged from 500,000 to 5 million.
