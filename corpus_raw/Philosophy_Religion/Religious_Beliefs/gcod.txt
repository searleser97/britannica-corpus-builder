Gcod, (Tibetan: “to cut off,” or “to cut up”)  esoteric Tibetan Buddhist rite that aims at “cutting off” the human ego and thus destroying the illusion of duality between samsara (the world of appearances and of death and rebirth) and nirvana.
The participant performs a dance, alone, in an isolated spot, to his own accompaniment of a thod-rgna (an hour-glass shaped drum made of human skulls) and thigh-bone trumpet. The ritual consists of visualizing a number of deities to whom the participant symbolically offers himself as a sacrificial meal, imagining that the goddess Vajrayogini cuts off his head and uses it as a caldron to hold his dismembered body. The body is transformed into an offering to the assembled deities.
