Xian, (Chinese: “immortal” or “transcendent”)  in Chinese Daoism, an immortal who has achieved divinity through devotion to Daoist practices and teachings.
Early Daoist sages, including Zhuangzi, referred perhaps allegorically to immortal beings with magical powers; some followers interpreted these references literally and devoted themselves to discovering the “drug of immortality” and prolonging their lives through breath control, yogalike exercises, and abstention from grains. Adepts in these practices, though appearing to die, were believed to achieve physical immortality and admission to heavenly realms inaccessible to the spirits of mere mortals. The pursuit of this state gave rise to a vast body of Daoist alchemical and other esoteric techniques and lore.
