Fire walking,   religious ceremony practiced in many parts of the world, including the Indian subcontinent, Malaya, Japan, China, Fiji Islands, Tahiti, Society Islands, New Zealand, Mauritius, Bulgaria, and Spain. It was also practiced in classical Greece and in ancient India and China.
Fire walking takes several forms, the most common being the practice of walking swiftly over a layer of embers spread thinly along the bottom of a shallow trench. Sometimes the devotees or priests or oracles have to walk through a blazing log fire. Instead of embers from a wood fire, there may be red-hot stones (Fiji and Mauritius), or embers may be poured over the devotee’s head in a “fire bath,” or the devotee may lash himself with a flaming torch.
Various explanations are offered for fire walking. Its performance is said sometimes to ensure a good harvest, other times to purify the participants; a man who is accused of a crime or of uttering an untruth may be asked to undergo the ordeal of fire to prove his innocence, and if he emerges unscathed his innocence is proved. Fire walkers believe that only those who lack faith will suffer from injuries from fire, while the faithful are spared. Devotees also undertake fire walking in fulfillment of vows.
Injuries from burns do occur, but they seem on the whole to be much less frequent than would be expected, especially as devotees do not apply any artificial preparation before the ordeal to protect their bodies. This fact has not been completely explained.
