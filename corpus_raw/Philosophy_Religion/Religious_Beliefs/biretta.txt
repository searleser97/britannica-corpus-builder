Biretta,   stiff square hat with three or four rounded ridges, worn by Roman Catholic, some Anglican, and some European Lutheran clergy for both liturgical and nonliturgical functions. A tassel is often attached. The colour designates the wearerâ€™s rank: red for cardinals, purple for bishops, and black for priests.
The biretta developed from the medieval cap known as a birettum, or pileus. By the 16th century it had evolved through several forms and had essentially attained its present form.
