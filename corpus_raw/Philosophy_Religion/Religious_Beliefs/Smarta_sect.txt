Smarta sect,  orthodox Hindu sect composed of members of the “twice-born,” or initiated upper classes (Brahman, Kshatriya, and Vaishya), whose primarily Brahman followers are characterized by their allegiance to all the gods of the Hindu pantheon and by their adherence to rules of ritual and of conduct laid down in the ancient sutra texts.
The name Smarta comes from the Sanskrit Smriti, a class of texts that are considered to be of human authorship—in contrast to the Vedas, which are considered to have been divinely revealed. The sutras (brief aphorisms) followed by the Smarta sect form part of the Smriti literature. Their greatest teacher and, according to some, the founder of the sect was the 8th-century philosopher Shankara, the proponent of Advaita (nondualist) Vedanta. The monastery he founded at Sringeri, in Karnataka (formerly Mysore state), continues to be the centre of the sect, and the head of the monastery, the jagadguru (“teacher of the world”), is the spiritual authority of the Smartas in south India and Gujarat and one of the chief religious personages in India.
The Smartas of the North differ somewhat from their counterparts in the South and in Gujarat, in that the nomenclature does not necessarily connote followers of Shankara. Also the number of pure Smarta temples are fewer in the North.
The Smartas may give preference to one deity above the others, and Shiva is highly favoured among them today. But they pay allegiance in their worship to the five major gods—Shiva, Vishnu, Shakti, Surya, and Ganesha—in the pancayatana puja (“five-shrines worship”).
Smarta Brahmans consider themselves orthodox and have tended to rigidly hold the traditional values of Hinduism. They are active in all branches of learning and have earned the honorary title of shastri (Sanskrit: “men of learning”), or, in Tamil, ayyar, which often follows their names.
