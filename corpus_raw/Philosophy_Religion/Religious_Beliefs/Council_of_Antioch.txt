Council of Antioch,  (341 CE), a non-ecumenical Christian church council held at Antioch (modern Antakya in southeastern Turkey) on the occasion of the consecration of the emperor Constantine I’s Golden Church there. It was the first of several 4th-century councils that attempted to replace orthodox Nicene theology with a modified Arianism. Attended by the Eastern emperor Constantius II and about 100 Eastern bishops, the council developed four creeds as substitutes for the Nicene, all of them to some degree unorthodox and omitting or rejecting the Nicene statement that Christ was “of one substance” (homoousios) with the Father. The disciplinary 25 canons of Antioch are generally thought to have come from this council, but some scholars believe that they were the work of an earlier council (330) at Antioch.
