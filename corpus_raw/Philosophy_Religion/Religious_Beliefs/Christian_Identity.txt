Christian Identity,  North American new religious movement characterized by a belief in white supremacy and anti-Semitism. Followers of Christian Identity believe that the covenant recounted in the Bible was actually made between God and the Anglo-Saxons and other European peoples,  who are the real Ten Lost Tribes of Israel. Christian Identity characterizes Jews as the offspring of Eve and Satan and views people of African descent as subhuman. Though it has been largely unsuccessful in persuading “white Israelites” of their purported identity, small churches are active, mainly in the northwestern United States. The movement proselytizes through publications, recordings, and the Internet.
