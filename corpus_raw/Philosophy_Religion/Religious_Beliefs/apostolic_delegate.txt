Apostolic delegate,   Vatican representative with no diplomatic status and hence no power to deal with civil governments. His relations are with the ecclesiastical hierarchy of a country that maintains no diplomatic relations with the Holy See. An apostolic delegate may not interfere with the exercise of the local bishopsâ€™ authority in their own jurisdictions. He concerns himself with church conditions in a region, gathering and channeling all relevant information to and from the Holy See.
