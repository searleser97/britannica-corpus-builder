Shaitan, also spelled Sheitan, Arabic Shayṭān,   in Islāmic myth, an unbelieving class of jinn (“spirits”); it is also the name of Iblīs, the devil, when he is performing demonic acts.
In the system of evil jinn outlined by the Arab writer al-Jāḥiẓ, the shaitans are identified simply as unbelieving jinn. Folklore, however, describes them as exceptionally ugly creatures, either male or female, capable of assuming human form—though their feet always remain hooves. They eat excrement and use disease as their weapon and are said to exist on the borderline between light and darkness. Indian and Syrian shaitans are described as the strongest of their class.
The exact nature of the shaitans, however, is difficult to determine. Historically, among the pre-Islāmic Arabs, they functioned as familiars, or Greek demons, providing inspiration for soothsayers and poets. In the stories of Solomon, the shaitans seem to be no more than particularly knowledgeable jinn. In the Qurʾān, however, they assume the role of devil, an obvious borrowing from Judaic tradition. While they are not necessarily evil, they belong to the hordes commanded by Iblīs, the devil, who is also called in Arabic ash-Shayṭān. He and the shaitans whisper evil suggestions into men’s ears but have no real power over men. It is said that they are as close to men as their blood, but the shaitans can only tempt, and their success depends on their ingenuity. See also jinnī; Iblīs.
