Bka’-brgyud-pa, (Tibetan: “Transmitted Word”) , also spelled Kagyupa,  Buddhist sect in Tibet. Its members are followers of the 11th-century teacher Mar-pa, who distinguished himself as a translator of Buddhist texts while continuing to live the life of a householder. Mar-pa studied in India under the master yogi (spiritual adept, or ascetic) Naropa. Mar-pa’s chief disciple was Mi-la ras-pa (Milarepa), who is revered as the greatest poet-saint in Tibetan history. Mi-la ras-pa in turn transmitted the teachings to Sgam-po-pa, whose own disciples established six separate schools of Bka’-brgyud-pa thought, known for the most part by the names of their monasteries but differing little in doctrine. Of these, the Karma-pa was, during the 15th to early 17th century, the chief rival of the now-predominant Dge-lugs-pa (Yellow Hat) for the temporal authority of Tibet, while the ’Brug-pa became the main school of Buddhism in Bhutan.
