Vanir,   in Norse mythology, race of gods responsible for wealth, fertility, and commerce and subordinate to the warlike Aesir. As reparation for the torture of their goddess Gullveig, the Vanir demanded from the Aesir monetary satisfaction or equal status. Declaring war instead, the Aesir suffered numerous defeats before granting equality. The Vanir sent their gods Nj√∂rd and Freyr to live with the Aesir and received Hoenir and Mimir in exchange. The birth of the poet-god Kvasir resulted from the peace ritual in which the two races mingled their saliva in the same vessel.
