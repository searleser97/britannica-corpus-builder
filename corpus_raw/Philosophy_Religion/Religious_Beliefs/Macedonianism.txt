Macedonianism, also called Pneumatomachian heresy,  a 4th-century Christian heresy that denied the full personhood and divinity of the Holy Spirit. According to this heresy, the Holy Spirit was created by the Son and was thus subordinate to the Father and the Son. (In orthodox Trinitarian theology, God is one in essence but three in persons—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, who are distinct and equal.) Those who accepted the heresy were called Macedonians but were also and more descriptively known as Pneumatomachians, the “spirit fighters.”
Some sources attribute leadership of the group to Macedonius, a semi-Arian who was twice bishop of Constantinople, but the writings of the Macedonians have all been lost, and their doctrine is known mainly from polemical refutations by orthodox writers, particularly St. Athanasius of Alexandria (Letters to Serapion) and St. Basil of Caesarea (On the Holy Spirit). The ecumenical First Council of Constantinople (381 ce) formally condemned the Macedonians and expanded the Creed of Nicaea (which had been promulgated at the Council of Nicaea in 325) to affirm the orthodox belief in the third person of the Trinity, “who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified.” The Macedonian heresy was suppressed by the emperor Theodosius I.
