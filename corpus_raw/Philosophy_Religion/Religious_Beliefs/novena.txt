Novena,  in Christianity, a term designating a spiritual devotion consisting of the recitation of a set form of prayer for nine consecutive days, in petition for a divine favour or in preparation for a liturgical feast or as participation in an important event such as a Year of Jubilee.
The nine days recall the similar time spent by the Apostles in prayer, “with the women and Mary,” in preparation for the gift of the Holy Spirit (Acts 1:13–14). Novenas were known in the Middle Ages, but their popularity dates from the 17th century. Especially popular was the novena before the feast of the Immaculate Conception (December 8). The Novena of Grace in honour of St. Francis Xavier (March 4–12) is among the best known. Other patrons commonly invoked in novenas are Mary, St. Jude, the Sacred Heart of Jesus, and St. Joseph. The novena typically consists of a direct petition of a specific patron; that prayer may be accompanied by the Lord’s Prayer or the Hail Mary. Some Marian novenas, most notably the 54-day miraculous novena, involve the recitation of an entire rosary.
The Christian usage is predated by the Roman novena or novendial, a nine-day festival solemnized on the occasion of an omen announcing misfortune. The term was also applied to the nine days of mourning following the death of the emperor or other personages.
