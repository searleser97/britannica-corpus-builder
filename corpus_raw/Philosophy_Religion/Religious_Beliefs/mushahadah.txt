Mushāhadah, (Arabic: “witnessing” or “viewing”)  also called shuhūd (“witnesses”),  in Sufi (Muslim mystic) terminology, the vision of God obtained by the illuminated heart of the seeker of truth. Through mushāhadah, the Sufi acquires yaqīn (real certainty), which cannot be achieved by the intellect or transmitted to those who do not travel the Sufi path. The Sufi has to pass various ritual stages (maqām) before he can attain the state of mushāhadah, which is eventually given to him only by an act of sheer grace of God. Mushāhadah, therefore, cannot be reached through good works or mujāhadah (struggle with the carnal self ). Further, it is bestowed by God upon whom he pleases.
Mushāhadah is the goal of every Sufi who aspires to the ultimate vision of God; its opposite, ḥijāb (veiling of the divine face), is the most severe punishment that a Sufi can imagine. Sufis regard their life before attaining mushāhadah as having been wasted. According to one anecdote, when the famous mystic Bāyazīd al-Besṭāmī (d. 874) was asked how old he was, he replied “four years.” When asked for an explanation, he answered, “I have been veiled from God by this world for seventy years, but I have seen Him during the last four years; the period in which one is veiled does not belong to one’s life.”
