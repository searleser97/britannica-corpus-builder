Feast of Christ the King, also called Solemnity of Our Lord Jesus Christ, King of the Universe,  festival celebrated in the Roman Catholic Church in honour of Jesus Christ as lord over all creation. Essentially a magnification of the Feast of the Ascension, it was established by Pope Pius XI in 1925. Originally, it was celebrated on the last Sunday in October, but in the revised liturgical calendar promulgated by Pope Paul VI in 1969 it was moved to the last Sunday of Ordinary Time (immediately preceding Advent), where its theme of Christâ€™s dominion made it a fitting end to the liturgical year. The festival is also observed in Lutheran, Anglican, and other Protestant churches.
