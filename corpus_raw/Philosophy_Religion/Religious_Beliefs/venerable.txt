Venerable, Latin Venerabilis,  title or respectful form of address, used from very early times in Europe, especially for certain clergy or for laymen of marked spiritual merit. St. Augustine in some epistles cited the term in reference to bishops, and Philip I of France was styled venerabilis and venerandus (“reverential”). The venerable by which Saint Bede is commonly known (“the Venerable Bede,” or “Bede the Venerable”) survives from a contemporary practice of so addressing bishops and abbots and, posthumously, worthy clerics such as Bede.
In the Roman Catholic Church, the title “Venerable” is bestowed on a deceased person in the first of three stages leading to beatification (with the title of “Blessed”) and canonization (with the title of “Saint”). The candidate to these higher honours becomes “Venerable” when his or her case has been officially accepted by the Sacred Congregation of Rites and when a special papal decree announces the candidacy, asserting that the person had virtues of heroic degree or had suffered martyrdom.
Priests of the Carthusian order (other than the prior-general) are addressed as “Venerable” (rather than “Reverend,” as in other orders).
In the Church of England, venerable is the proper title of address for an archdeacon.
