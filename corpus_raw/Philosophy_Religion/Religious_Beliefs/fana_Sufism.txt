Fana, Arabic fanāʾ (“passing away,” “ceasing to exist,” or “annihilation”),  the complete denial of self and the realization of God that is one of the steps taken by the Muslim Sufi (mystic) toward the achievement of union with God. Fana may be attained by constant meditation and by contemplation on the attributes of God, coupled with the denunciation of human attributes. When the Sufi succeeds in purifying himself entirely of the earthly world and loses himself in the love of God, it is said that he has “annihilated” his individual will and “passed away” from his own existence to live only in God and with God.
Many Sufis hold that fana alone is a negative state, for even though ridding oneself of earthly desires and recognizing and denouncing human imperfections are necessary for every pious individual, such virtues are insufficient for those who choose the path of Sufism. Through fanāʾ ʿan al-fanāʾ (“passing away from passing away”), however, the Sufi succeeds in annihilating human attributes and loses all awareness of earthly existence; he then, through the grace of God, is revived, and the secrets of the divine attributes are revealed to him. Only after regaining full consciousness does he attain the more sublime state of baqāʾ (subsistence) and finally become ready for the direct vision of God.
Despite comparisons between fana and certain Buddhist and Christian concepts, many Muslim scholars insist that fana, like other Sufi doctrines, is based entirely on Islamic teachings, referring to the following Qurʾānic verse as the direct source of fana: “All things in creation suffer ‘annihilation’ and there remains the face of the Lord in its majesty and bounty” (55:26–27).
