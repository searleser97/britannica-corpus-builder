Absolution,   in Christianity, a pronouncement of remission (forgiveness) of sins to the penitent. In both Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy, confession, or penance, is a sacrament. The power to absolve lies with the priest, who can grant release from the guilt of sin to sinners who are truly contrite, confess their sins, and promise to perform satisfaction to God. In the New Testament the grace of forgiveness is seen as originating in Jesus Christ and being subsequently extended to sinners by members of the Christian priesthood. In the early Christian church, the priest publicly absolved repentant sinners after they had confessed and performed their penance in public. During the Middle Ages, however, private (auricular) confession became the usual procedure, and thus absolution followed in private. The priest absolved the penitent sinner using the formula “I absolve you from your sins in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.” In place of this Western formula, the Eastern Orthodox churches generally employ a formula such as “May God, through me, a sinner, forgive thee…”
In Protestant churches, absolution is usually a public rather than a private declaration. The Anglican and Lutheran churches use formulas ranging from the declaratory “I forgive you all your sins…” to “Almighty God have mercy upon you, and forgive you all your sins.” In general, Protestant churches have tended to confine absolution to prayers for forgiveness and the announcement of God’s willingness to forgive all those who truly repent of their sins. In these denominations, absolution is neither a judicial act nor a means by which the forgiveness of sins is conferred but is instead a statement of divine judgment and divine forgiveness. Nevertheless, a formula for the public confession of sins and the public pronouncement of forgiveness is included in most Christian liturgies.
