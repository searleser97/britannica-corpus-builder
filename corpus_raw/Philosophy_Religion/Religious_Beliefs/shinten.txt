Shinten,   collectively, sacred texts of the Shintō religion of Japan. Although there is no single text that is accepted as authoritative by all schools of Shintō thought, some books are considered invaluable as records of ancient beliefs and ritual; they are generally grouped together as shinten. The books include the Kojiki (“Records of Ancient Matters”), the Nihon shoki, or Nihon-gi (“Chronicles of Japan”), the Kogoshūi (“Gleanings of Ancient Works”), and the Engi shiki (“Institutes of the Engi Period”).
Some commentators enlarge the category of sacred texts to include also such works as the Man’yōshū (“Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves,” the oldest Japanese anthology of verse, compiled in the 8th century ad); the Fudoki (“Records of Air and Soil,” 8th-century notes on local legends and geography); and the Taihō-ryō (oldest extant code of law in Japan, promulgated in 702). The shinten give mythological and historical accounts of the origin of the world; the appearance of the gods, the land, and all the creatures of the universe; the establishment of the Japanese nation; the proper relationship between the gods and government; and ceremonies of worship, manners, and customs.
