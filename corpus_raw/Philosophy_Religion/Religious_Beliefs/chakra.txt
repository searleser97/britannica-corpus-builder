Chakra, also spelled Cakra, Sanskrit C̣akra,  (“wheel”), any of a number of psychic-energy centres of the body, prominent in the occult physiological practices of certain forms of Hinduism and Tantric Buddhism. The chakras are conceived of as focal points where psychic forces and bodily functions merge with and interact with each other. Among the supposed 88,000 chakras in the human body, six major ones located roughly along the spinal cord and another one located just above the crown of the skull are of principal importance. Each of these seven major chakras (in Buddhism, four) is associated with a specific colour, shape, sense organ, natural element, deity, and mantra (monosyllabic prayer formula). The most important of these are the lowest chakra (mūlādhāra), located at the base of the spine, and the highest (sahasrāra), at the top of the head. The mūlādhāra encircles a mysterious divine potency (kuṇḍalinī) that the individual attempts, by Yogic techniques, to raise from chakra to chakra until it reaches the sahasrāra and self-illumination results. See also kuṇḍalinī.
