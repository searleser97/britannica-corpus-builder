Munkar and Nakīr,   in Islāmic eschatology, two angels who test the faith of the dead in their tombs. After death, the deceased is placed upright in the grave by Munkar and Nakīr and asked to identify Muḥammad. The righteous will know that he is the messenger of God (rasūl Allāh) and be allowed to rest in peace until the Judgment Day. Infidels and sinners, however, not being able to reply, will be beaten by the two angels every day except Friday for as long as God deems necessary.
