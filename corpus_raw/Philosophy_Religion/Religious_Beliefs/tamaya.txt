Tamaya,   in the Shintō religion of Japan, a memorial altar dedicated to the spirits of deceased ancestors. The tamaya is not found in all homes observing Shintō because Buddhist practices dominate Japanese funerary rites. But in priestly or strict Shintō households, the tamaya is placed on a lower level than the commonly found family altar, the kamidana (“god-shelf”). It contains a mirror or a tablet (tamashiro) listing the names of the deceased family members.
When a death occurs, before the body is removed for burial, the spirit of the deceased is asked to stay behind and to guard the house. The name of the deceased is listed on a tamashiro, and offerings are made to the spirit daily for the first 50 days following death. The tablet is then placed in the tamaya for regular worship along with other family ancestors. Compare butsudan.
