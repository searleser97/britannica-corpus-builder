Sanguan, Wade-Giles romanization San Kuan,  in Chinese Daoism, the Three Officials: Tianguan, official of heaven who bestows happiness; Diguan, official of earth who grants remission of sins; and Shuiguan, official of water who averts misfortune. The Chinese theatre did much to popularize Tianguan by introducing a skit before each play called “The Official of Heaven Brings Happiness.” Reflecting a Daoist principle that held heaven, earth, and water to be three transcendent powers, Chang Heng (2nd century ce) proposed that the confession of sins be written in triplicate, one to be burned for heaven, another buried in earth, and the third sunk in water.
