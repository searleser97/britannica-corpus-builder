Sīla, (Pāli), Sanskrit śīla,  in Buddhism, morality, or right conduct; sīla comprises three stages along the Eightfold Path—right speech, right action, and right livelihood. Evil actions are considered to be the product of defiling passions (see āsrāva), but their causes are rooted out only by the exercise of wisdom (prajna).
Buddhist morality is codified in the form of 10 precepts (dasa-sīla), which require abstention from: (1) taking life; (2) taking what is not given; (3) committing sexual misconduct (interpreted as anything less than chastity for the monk and as sexual conduct contrary to proper social norms, such as adultery, for the layman); (4) engaging in false speech; (5) using intoxicants; (6) eating after midday; (7) participating in worldly amusements; (8) adorning the body with ornaments and using perfume; (9) sleeping on high and luxurious beds; and (10) accepting gold and silver.
Laymen are to observe the first five precepts (pañca-sīla) at all times. Occasionally, such as during the fortnightly fast day, they may observe eight precepts (aṣṭā-sīla; the first nine, with the seventh and eight combined as one). Normally, the full 10 vows are observed only by monks or nuns, who also follow the detailed monastic rules (see pātimokkha) that are a further elaboration of the precepts.
