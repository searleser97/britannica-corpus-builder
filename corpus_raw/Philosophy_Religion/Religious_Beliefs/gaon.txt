Gaon, (Hebrew: “excellency”, ) plural Geonim,  the title accorded to the Jewish spiritual leaders and scholars who headed Talmudic academies that flourished, with lengthy interruptions, from the 7th to the 13th century in Babylonia and Palestine. The chief concern of the geonim was to interpret and develop Talmudic Law and to safeguard Jewish legal traditions by adjudicating points of legal controversy. Their replies (responsa) were quoted far beyond the limits of their own communities and are of great value in studying the Jewish history and theology of the period. The geonim continued a tradition of scholarship begun long before by the soferim (teachers and interpreters of biblical law) and kept alive in subsequent centuries by the tannaim and amoraim (who, respectively, produced the compilation of law called the Mishna and wrote commentaries on the Mishna, called Gemara).
A long-standing rivalry between the Babylonian and Palestinian geonim came to a head in the 10th century. Saʿadia ben Joseph, famous Babylonian gaon of the academy at Sura, bested his rival, Aaron ben Meir of Jerusalem, in a controversy involving calendar dates of Jewish festivals. Thereafter, the superiority of the Babylonian geonim was rarely questioned.
The prestige of the geonim gradually declined with the establishment of Talmudic academies elsewhere and the acceptance of local scholars as competent authorities on Jewish Law.
After the gaonic period, the term gaon was used simply as a title of honour to describe excellence in Jewish learning. Thus Elijah ben Solomon (1720–97) became known as gaon of Vilna or the Gaon.
