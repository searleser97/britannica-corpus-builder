Peace Mission,  predominantly black 20th-century religious movement in the United States, founded and led by Father Divine (1878/80–1965), who was regarded, or worshiped, by his followers as God, Dean of the Universe, and Harnesser of Atomic Energy.
According to most accounts, Father Divine was born George Baker and reared in Savannah, Ga., during the post-Reconstruction period, when black messiahs flourished in an atmosphere of misery and degradation. He received indelible impressions from his immersion in primitive mysticism and the Holiness and Pentecostal movements.
The transition from George Baker to Major J. Devine to Father Divine essentially was completed when he set up his first “heaven” in Sayville, Long Island, N.Y., in 1919. Legal entanglements forced him to relocate in Manhattan (Harlem) and Philadelphia, Pa., but the Peace Mission continued to grow and spread through many cities of the northern and western United States.
Heaven, according to Father Divine, was symbolized by separation of sexes and union of all races in a communion composed of a multicourse feast. He also preached total racial integration, that all things and persons are to be forsaken for the Father, and that heaven is on earth. Although he owned almost nothing directly, his 500,000 to 2,000,000 followers provided him free access to a fortune worth at least $1,500,000.
The Peace Mission supported blacks in businesses that became successful and fulfilled basic needs. The key to Father Divine’s success was the devotion of competent disciples. In the late 20th century this cohesion diminished and the movement dwindled.
