Shemini Atzeret,   (Hebrew: “Eighth Day of the Solemn Assembly”), a Jewish religious festival on the eighth day of Sukkoth (Feast of Booths), considered by some to be an independent celebration immediately following Sukkoth. In Old Testament times a distinction was made regarding sacrifices: whereas 70 sacrifices were offered on the first seven days of Sukkoth to signify the “70 nations” constituting all humanity, a single ram and a single bullock were sacrificed on the eighth day to symbolize Israel’s special relationship to God. In Israel, Simhath Torah is also celebrated on the eighth day of Sukkoth, although in other countries it is celebrated on the ninth day. Shemini Atzeret is celebrated on Tuesday, September 28,  2021.
