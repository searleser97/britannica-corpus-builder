Black mass,  in the Roman Catholic church, a requiem mass during which the celebrant wears black vestments. The term is more commonly used, however, for a blasphemous and usually obscene burlesque of the true mass performed by satanic cults. The naked back of a woman often serves as an altar, and a validly consecrated host is generally used to intensify the mockery. The rite commonly incorporates other elements of satanic magic such as philtres or abortifacients.
Charges of Satanism and celebration of the blasphemous black mass have been made against persons accused of heresy and witchcraft since early Christian times. Allegations were made against the Knights Templars in the 14th century and against the Freemasons in the 19th. Joris-Karl Huysmans’s novel Là-bas (1891; Down There) describes a black mass celebrated in late 19th-century France.
