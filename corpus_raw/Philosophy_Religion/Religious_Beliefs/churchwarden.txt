Churchwarden,   in the Church of England, one of the lay guardians of a parish church. The office dates from the 14th century, but the original duties of maintaining the edifice and goods of the church, with the financial obligations involved, were transferred to the parochial councils in 1921. Duties that remain are the provision of necessaries for divine service, the allocation of seats, and the keeping of order during services. Churchwardens are appointed after elections, one by the incumbent and one by the parishioners, in each parish.
In other parts of the Anglican Communion, churchwardens discharge much the same duties as in England, but their financial responsibilities are often greater.
