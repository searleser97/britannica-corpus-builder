Taihō code,  (ad 701), in Japan, administrative and penal code of the Taihō era early in the Nara period, modeled on the codes of the Chinese T’ang dynasty (618–907) and in force until the late 8th century. Although the first work on legal codes was begun in 662, the Taihō code was the most famous. It provided for the establishment of the central-government administrative organs; of provinces (kuni) ruled by governors (kokushi) who were appointed by the central government; districts (gun, or kōri) administered by district governors (gunji) selected locally from the gentry; and townships of 50 households, governed by headmen. Provisions included not only administrative laws (ryō) but also penal laws (ritsu), which concerned matters of arrest and imprisonment.
The original code is not extant, but its content has been largely preserved in the Yōrō code (718).
