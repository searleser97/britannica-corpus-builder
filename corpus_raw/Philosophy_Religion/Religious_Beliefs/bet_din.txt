Bet din, also spelled beth din (Hebrew: “house of judgment”), plural batte din,  Jewish tribunal empowered to adjudicate cases involving criminal, civil, or religious law. The history of such institutions goes back to the time the 12 tribes of Israel appointed judges and set up courts of law (Deuteronomy 16:18).
During the period of the Second Temple of Jerusalem (516 bc–ad 70), three types of batte din operated side by side. The highest court, called Great Bet Din, or Sanhedrin, consisted of 71 members and convened on the Temple grounds to legislate and interpret Jewish Law. Its powers included the right to appoint judges for the two types of lower courts; the higher of these was called the Small Sanhedrin, had 23 members, presided over criminal cases, and functioned in virtually every town of 120 or more male inhabitants. The smallest of the batte din had three judges each.
Historically, the functions and power of batte din varied according to the social and political conditions of the Jewish communities under their jurisdiction. Thus, in Spain, because of its large Jewish population, the king granted the bet din jurisdiction over criminal cases, and in Poland, Jews had recourse to a bet din as a court of last appeal until 1764. Elsewhere the powers of batte din were sometimes restricted to questions of ritual only.
Batte din still operate throughout the modern world under the direction of rabbinic scholars who adjudicate questions affecting their Jewish communities. In Israel all questions of personal status (e.g., divorce and marriage) are resolved by religious courts. In countries where civil law requires that all divorces be granted by civil courts, Orthodox and Conservative Jews are nonetheless required to obtain a religious divorce before remarriage from either a bet din or a rabbi who is competent to preside over affairs of divorce.
