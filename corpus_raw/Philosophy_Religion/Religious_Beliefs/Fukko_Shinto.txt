Fukko Shintō, English Restoration Shinto, or Reform Shintō,  school of Japanese religion prominent in the 18th century that attempted to uncover the pure meaning of ancient Shintō thought through philological study of the Japanese classics. The school had a lasting influence on the development of modern Shintō thought.
Kada Azumamaro (1669–1736) was a pioneer in the Fukko Shintō movement. Kamo Mabuchi (1697–1769) rejected both the Buddhist- and Confucian-centred interpretations of Shintō and stressed a morality of pure simplicity in accordance with the order of heaven and earth as preserved in ancient Japanese tradition. Kamo Mabuchi’s disciple, Motoori Norinaga, rejected such a Taoist-oriented interpretation and insisted that Shintō was based on the revelation of an exalted deity of creation, Takamimusubi no Kami, by the sun goddess Amaterasu Omikami. Motoori devoted many years to a philological and theoretical interpretation of the Kojiki (“Records of Ancient Matters”), completing his commentary to that work in 1798. The last noted Fukko Shintō scholar was Hirata Atsutane (1776–1843), who sought to construct a Shintō theology, leaning heavily on the writings in Chinese of the Jesuits Matteo Ricci and Didacus de Pantoja.
