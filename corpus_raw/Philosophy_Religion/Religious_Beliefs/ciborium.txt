Ciborium, plural Ciboria, or Ciboriums,  in religious art, any receptacle designed to hold the consecrated Eucharistic bread of the Christian church. The ciborium is usually shaped like a rounded goblet, or chalice, having a dome-shaped cover. Its form originally developed from that of the pyx, the vessel containing the consecrated bread used in the service of the Holy Communion. Medieval ciboria were small and often had spire-shaped covers above a cylindrical bowl. After the Reformation, ciboria became larger and gradually acquired their present rounded form. The ciborium is not a consecrated vessel and needs only a blessing before it is first used. The vessel can be made of either silver or gold, but the interior of the cup must be lined with gold.
