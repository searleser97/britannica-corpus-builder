Catholicos, Greek Katholikos,   (“universal” bishop), in Eastern Christian Churches, title of certain ecclesiastical superiors. In earlier times the designation had occasionally been used, like archimandrite and exarch, for a superior abbot; but the title eventually came to denote a bishop who, while head of a major church, was still in some way dependent on his patriarch. The titles catholicos and patriarch later became synonymous and were both applied to the heads of the Armenian, Nestorian (Assyrian), and Georgian churches. In the Armenian Church there are two catholicoi: the supreme catholicos of Ejmiadzin and the catholicos of Sis. The title catholicos patriarch is also used by the primates of the Armenian Catholic Church and the Chaldean Church.
