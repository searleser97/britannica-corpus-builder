Hanif,   in the Qurʾān, the sacred scripture of Islām, an Arabic designation for true monotheists (especially Abraham) who were not Jews, Christians, or worshipers of idols. The word appears to have been borrowed from a Syriac word meaning “heathen” and, by extension, designating a Hellenized person of culture. There is no evidence that a true hanif cult existed in pre-Islāmic Arabia, but there were certain individuals who, having repudiated the old gods, prepared the way for Islām but embraced neither Judaism nor Christianity. In this sense, some of Muḥammad’s relatives, contemporaries, and early supporters were called hanifs—e.g., Waraqah ibn Nawfal, a cousin of the Prophet’s first wife, Khadījah, and Umayyah ibn Abī aṣ-Ṣalt, an early 7th-century Arab poet.
