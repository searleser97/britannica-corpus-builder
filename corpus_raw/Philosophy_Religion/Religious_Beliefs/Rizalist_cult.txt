Rizalist cult,   any of numerous ethnic religious groups in the Philippines that believe in the divinity of Jos√© Rizal, the national hero martyred by the Spanish in 1896. Among many peasant cults it is commonly believed that he is still alive and will return to deliver his followers from poverty and oppression. Rizal has been identified as God, as the second, or Filipino, Christ, and as the god of the pre-Spanish Malay religion. Rizalist cults, such as the Iglesia Sagrada ni Lahi (Holy Church of the Race) and the Banner of the Race Church (the largest group), synthesize Roman Catholic rituals, images, and organization with traditional Filipino elements. Some 300,000 rural people adhere to these cults.
