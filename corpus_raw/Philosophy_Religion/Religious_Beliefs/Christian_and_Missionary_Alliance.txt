Christian and Missionary Alliance,  missionary and evangelistic movement that developed from the work of Albert B. Simpson (died 1919), a Presbyterian minister who left that church to become an independent evangelist in New York City. In 1887 Simpson and others organized two societies, one for home and one for foreign missions. The two societies were merged into the Christian and Missionary Alliance in 1897. Part of the Holiness church movement, the organization considers itself not a church, sect, or denomination but rather a movement among all Christians. It stresses Christ as “Saviour, Sanctifier, Healer, and Coming King” and supports an active missions program. The doctrinal statement affirms traditional Christology, the inerrancy of the Bible, and the premillennial Second Coming of Jesus.
In 2004 the group reported more than 400,000 members and nearly 2,000 congregations in North America. U.S. headquarters are in Colorado Springs, Colo.; in the United States, congregations are independent but are joined together in a general conference that meets annually. Canadian headquarters are in Willowdale, Ont.
