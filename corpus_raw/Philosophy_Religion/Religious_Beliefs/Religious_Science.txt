Religious Science,   religious movement founded in the United States by Ernest Holmes (1887–1960). Holmes and his brother Fenwicke were drawn to New Thought teachings and to a belief in the power of the mind for healing and fulfillment of life. In 1926 Holmes’s major work, The Science of Mind, was published. In 1927 he established the Institute of Religious Science and Philosophy in Los Angeles to teach his principles. Some of the graduates established churches based on Holmes’s teachings, and in 1949 he reluctantly agreed to the establishment of a Religious Science denomination. There are now two branches: the United Church of Religious Science and the smaller Religious Science International, which prefers a less centralized polity. The two organizations have identical doctrines. The United Church publishes the magazine Science of Mind.
Like the New Thought tradition, Religious Science is basically monistic. The individual human mind is an expression of the Universal Mind, and the universe is its material manifestation. Man and nature are, therefore, like the God who is their true being, considered to be fundamentally good, and apparent evil stems from ignorance of the highest identity. The mind, working with creative faith and knowledge of its identity with the infinite, draws on infinite resources in what is called “affirmative prayer.” When directed to a particular end, such as healing of mind or body, this employment of mind is called “spiritual mind treatment” and its results a “demonstration.” Religious Science trains both ministers and practitioners, who are qualified to give spiritual mind treatments. Services are generally similar in format to those of mainstream Protestant churches, but with an especially affirmative, optimistic tone.
