Daphnephoria,  in Greek religion, festival held every ninth year at Thebes in Boeotia in honour of Apollo Ismenius (after the Theban river called Ismenus) or Apollo Chalazius (god of hail). It consisted of a procession in which the chief figure was a boy who was of good family and whose parents were still alive. In front of the boy walked one of his nearest relatives, carrying an olive branch hung with laurel (daphnē) flowers and bronze balls and twined round with ribbons. Then followed the Daphnēphoros (“Laurel Bearer”), i.e., the young priest of Apollo Ismenius. The Daphnēphoros also dedicated a bronze tripod in the temple of Apollo. According to tradition, the festival originated because of a vision sent to the Theban general Polematas, in which the Thebans were promised victory in their war against the Aeolians and the Pelasgians if the Daphnephoria were instituted.
