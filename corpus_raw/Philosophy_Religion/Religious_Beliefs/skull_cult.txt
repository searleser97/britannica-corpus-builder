Skull cult,   veneration of human skulls, usually those of ancestors, by various prehistoric and some modern primitive people. Begun probably as early as the Early Paleolithic Period, the practice of preserving and honouring the skull apart from the rest of the skeleton appears to have continued in different forms throughout prehistoric times. Although some scholars believe that these skulls demonstrate prehistoric manâ€™s cannibalism, most authorities agree that the skulls were cleaned and set up for worship long after death.
Prehistoric man also paid special attention to animal skulls. This practice is believed to have been a type of hunting magic, whereas the human skulls were honoured with the reverence accorded to heroic ancestors and perhaps also were thought to assure the possessor of the protection and help of the deceased.
