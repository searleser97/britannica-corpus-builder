Maʿamadot,   (Hebrew: “stands,” or “posts”), 24 groups of Jewish laymen that witnessed, by turns of one week each, the daily sacrifice in the Second Temple of Jerusalem as representatives of the common people. Gradually maʿamadot were organized in areas outside Jerusalem, so that the people could hold special services in their villages while their representatives were present in the Temple. Some scholars view these village maʿamadot as the first step toward regular synagogue worship.
Though public sacrifices were terminated when Jerusalem was destroyed in ad 70, daily prayers called maʿamadot are still recited privately by many pious Jews.
