Holy days of obligation,  in the Roman Catholic Church, religious feast days on which Catholics must attend mass and refrain from unnecessary work. Although all Sundays are sanctified in this way, the term holy days usually refers to other feasts that must be observed in the same manner as Sunday.
The number of such days has varied greatly, since bishops had the right to institute new feasts for their dioceses until the 17th century. Pope Urban VIII then limited the number of holy days throughout the church to 36. In 1918, considering the difficulty of observing religious feasts that are not civil holidays, canon law designated 10 holy days: Christmas, Circumcision of Christ (now celebrated as the Solemnity of Mary), Epiphany, Ascension, Corpus Christi, Assumption, the Solemnity of Saints Peter and Paul, All Saints’ Day, the Immaculate Conception, and St. Joseph’s Day. With papal permission the number has been reduced or other changes made in some countries. Thus Epiphany, Corpus Christi, the Solemnity of Saints Peter and Paul, and St. Joseph’s Day are not kept in the United States, and bishops in the United States and other countries have permission to abrogate (temporarily waive) the requirement to attend mass on certain holy days of obligation when they fall on a Saturday or a Monday. Scotland and Ireland keep all 10 holy days, except that Ireland celebrates St. Patrick’s Day instead of St. Joseph’s.
The various Eastern churches have their own feasts of obligation, which are generally more numerous than those of the Western church. Many of the Roman Catholic feasts are also celebrated by Lutherans, Anglicans, and other Protestant denominations. See holiday (table).
