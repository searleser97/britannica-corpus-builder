Dge-lugs-pa, also spelled Gelukpa (Tibetan: “Model of Virtue”), also called Yellow Hat Sect,  since the 17th century, the predominant Buddhist order in Tibet and the sect of the Dalai and Paṇchen lamas.
The Dge-lugs-pa sect was founded in the late 14th century by Tsong-kha-pa, who was himself a member of the austere Bka’-gdams-pa school. Tsong-kha-pa’s reforms represented a return to tradition. He enforced strict monastic discipline, restored celibacy and the prohibition of alcohol and meat, established a higher standard of learning for monks, and, while continuing to respect the Vajrayāna tradition of esotericism that was prevalent in Tibet, allowed Tantric and magical rites only in moderation. Three large monasteries were quickly established near Lhasa: at Dga’ldan (Ganden) in 1409, ’Bras-spungs (Drepung) in 1416, and Se-ra in 1419. The abbots of the ’Bras-spungs monastery first received the title Dalai Lama in 1578, and a period of struggle for the leadership of Tibet followed, principally with the Karma-pa sect. The Dge-lugs-pa eventually appealed to the Mongol chief Güüshi Khan for help, and his defeat in 1642 of the king of Gtsang, who favoured the Karma-pa, secured the temporal authority of Tibet for the Dge-lugs-pa. They continued to rule the country through their leader, the Dalai Lama, until the Chinese communists took over the country in 1950. During a popular revolt at Lhasa in 1959, the Dalai Lama escaped to India. A new Paṇchen Lama, installed as a figurehead by the Chinese, was dismissed in 1964.
The name Yellow Hat refers to the distinctive yellow headdress adopted by the Dge-lugs-pa to distinguish themselves from the Karma-pa sect, whose monks wear red hats.
