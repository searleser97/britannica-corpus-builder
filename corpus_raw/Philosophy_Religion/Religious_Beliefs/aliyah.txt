Aliyah, plural aliyahs, aliyoth, or aliyot, Hebrew ʿaliya (“going up”),  in Judaism, the honour accorded to a worshiper of being called up to read an assigned passage from the Torah (first five books of the Bible). Because the passage assigned for each sabbath-morning service is subdivided into a minimum of seven sections, at least seven different persons are called up for these readings. An additional reader is called up to repeat part of the final reading and to recite the Hafṭarah (a reading from the prophetic books of the Bible). At certain times throughout the year (e.g., fast days, festivals), there are fewer Torah readings and they may not be subdivided into more than the statutory number.
If a cohen (a direct descendant of Aaron, the first priest) and a Levite (a member of the priestly tribe of Levi) are present, it is their privilege to be called up for the first and second readings, respectively. Normally, therefore, an Israelite (ordinary worshiper) may not be so honoured until the third reading of the Torah.
By the 14th century it had become customary to appoint a trained reader to do the actual reading to avoid embarrassing those whose knowledge of Hebrew was inadequate. The persons who were called up, therefore, merely presided during the reading and recited the appropriate blessings. The practice of selling the aliyah, once common, has been discontinued.
In modern times, aliyah has also been used to designate the “going up” to Israel of immigrants from other lands, just as in former times it meant going up to the Holy Land.
