Matronalia, also called Matronales Feriae,  in Roman religion, ancient festival of Juno, the birth goddess, celebrated annually by Roman matrons on March 1; on that date in 375 bc a temple was dedicated to Juno. According to tradition, the cult was established by Titus Tatius, king of the Sabines. The Matronalia symbolized not only the sacredness of marriage but also the peace that followed the first marriages between Romans and Sabine women. The festival consisted of a procession of married women to the temple, where they made offerings to Juno. At home, offerings were supplemented by prayers for marital felicity. Wives received gifts from their husbands and gave a feast for their female slaves.
