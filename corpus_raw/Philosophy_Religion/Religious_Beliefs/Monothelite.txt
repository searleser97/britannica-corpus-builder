Monothelite,  any of the 7th-century Christians who, while otherwise orthodox, maintained that Christ had only one will. The Monothelites were attempting to resolve the question of the unity of Christ’s person on the basis of the firmly established doctrine of the two natures, divine and human, in the person of Christ.
The controversy originated in the attempts by the Byzantine emperor Heraclius to win back for the church and empire the excommunicated and persecuted Monophysites of Egypt and Syria. In Armenia in 622, Heraclius first suggested to the head of the Severian Monophysites that the divine and human natures in Christ, while quite distinct in his one person, had but one will (thelēma) and one operation (energeia). Sergius, patriarch of Constantinople, was a strong upholder of the doctrine and was the emperor’s adviser on the question. In 638 Heraclius issued the Ekthesis (“Statement of Faith”), which formulated the position. This led to such intense controversy that Heraclius’ successor, Constans II, issued an edict in 648 forbidding all discussion of the question. This secured silence, despite the protest of the Western church at the Lateran Council of 649.
When Constantine IV became emperor in 668, the controversy was revived, and the new emperor summoned a general council, which met at Constantinople in 680. It was preceded in the same year by a synod under Pope Agatho at Rome. According to Agatho, the will is a property of the nature, so that, as there are two natures, there are two wills; but the human will determines itself ever conformably to the divine and almighty will. The third Council of Constantinople condemned Monothelitism and asserted two wills and two operations in the person of Christ.
