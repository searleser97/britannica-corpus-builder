Qurrāʾ, (Arabic: “reciters”, ) singular Qāri,  ʾ, professional class of reciters of the text of the Muslim sacred scripture, the Qurʾān. In the early Islāmic community, Muḥammad’s divine revelations had often been memorized by his Companions (disciples), a practice derived from the pre-Islāmic tradition of preserving poetry orally. It became common for pious Muslims to memorize the Qurʾān in its entirety, even after it had been assembled in written form. Such reciters were often called upon by scholars to elucidate points of pronunciation and meaning obscured by the early and deficient Arabic script, and thus they helped to define the rudiments of Arabic grammar and linguistics.
The sheer number of reciters—who by the 9th century formed an established, specialized class—produced such a variety of subtly differing interpretations that in the time of the ʿAbbāsid caliph al-Qāhir (reigned 932–934) seven qurrāʾ were declared the sole orthodox interpreters of the Qurʾān and all other readings were banned. As early as the 7th century ad, in the confrontation at Ṣiffīn (657) between the fourth caliph, ʿAlī, and Muʿāwiyah, a contender for the caliphate, the influence of the qurrāʾ was such that they forced ʿAlī to submit to the arbitration that cost him the caliphate (see Ṣiffīn, Battle of). At the beginning of the 9th century, a union of qurrāʾ, with its own elected head, the shaykh al-qurrāʾ, is recorded in Baghdad.
The science of reciting the Qurʾān (qirāʾah) soon produced a corresponding art of intoning the Qurʾān (tajwīd), and this ritual chanting enabled large congregations of Muslims to follow the texts with relative ease. Religious figures employed in the mosques still memorize the Qurʾān to aid them in interpreting the revelations to the faithful. In some Arab countries the professional duties of reciting the Qurʾān at festivals and mosque services are generally reserved for blind men, who are trained in qirāʾah from childhood as a means of supporting themselves.
