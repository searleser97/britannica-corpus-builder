Wang Bi, Wade-Giles romanization Wang Pi,  (born 226 ce, China—died  249, China), one of the most brilliant and precocious Chinese philosophers of his day.
By the time of Wang’s death at the age of 23, he was already the author of outstanding commentaries on the Daoist classic, the Daodejing (or Laozi), and the Confucian mantic classic the Yijing (“Classic of Changes”). Through these commentaries he helped introduce metaphysics into Chinese thought, anticipating the work of the later neo-Confucians.
According to Wang, while everything is governed by its own principle, there is one ultimate principle that underlies and unites all things. This ultimate principle is Dao, which he interprets as nothingness (benwu). Unlike earlier Daoists, Wang does not see nothingness as essentially in conflict with being. On the contrary, it is the ultimate source of all things; it is pure being (benti). It is because of this theory that “ontology,” the study of being, is translated as bentilun in modern Chinese.
In his theory of emotions, Wang was concerned with the need for human beings to control their emotions. At one time he had a low opinion of Confucius because the famous sage was capable of expressing great joy and sorrow. Later, however, Wang decided that emotion belongs to human nature and that even a sage, as a person, can react only like a person. The difference between a sage and a normal person is that a sage will not be ensnared by emotion.
