Aparimitayus-sutra-shastra, (Sanskrit: “Treatise on the Aparimitayus-sutra”) also spelled Aparimitāyus-sūtra-śāstra,  in Buddhism, a short treatise  (shastra) on the Aparimitayus-sutra, one of the major Pure Land sutras, by the Indian monk Vasubandhu (flourished 5th century ce). It expresses the author’s personal devotion to Amitabha, the celestial Buddha of Infinite Light, and his desire for rebirth in the Western Paradise, or Amitabha’s Pure Land (Sukhavati).
After embracing the Mahayana (“Great Vehicle”) form of Buddhism, Vasubandhu wrote his commentary on the longer of the two sutras that bear the Sanskrit title Sukhavativyuha-sutra (“Description of the Western Paradise Sutra”), also popularly known as the Larger Pure Land Sutra. Another popular name of the sutra, the Aparimitayus-sutra (“Sutra of Infinite Life”), reflects its association with Amitabha, whose byname, Amitayus, means “Buddha of Infinite Life.” Vasubandhu’s shastra enjoyed such authority that he was eventually considered a patriarch of the Pure Land school of Buddhism. A Chinese translation was made in 529.
His treatise begins with 24 four-line stanzas of poetry, primarily on the glorious adornments of the Pure Land. In the prose interpretation that follows, Vasubandhu expounds on the “five spiritual gates,” especially the “gates of perception”—i.e., perception of Amitabha, of the bodhisattvas (Buddhas-to-be) surrounding him, and of the Buddha Land in which they dwell. Ultimately, these coalesce into a single pure transcendent vision, which leads to one’s rebirth as a bodhisattva in order to save other sentient beings.
