Fu Shen, also spelled Fushen,  a Chinese god of happiness, the deification of a 6th-century mandarin. As a generic title, the name Fu Shen denotes the beneficent gods of Chinese mythology.
Yang Cheng (or Yang Xiji), who served the Wudi emperor (reigned 502–549 ce) as a criminal judge in Hunan province, was deeply disturbed that the ruler was destroying the normal family life of dwarfs by pressing them into service as personal servants and court entertainers. Yang admonished the emperor, pointing out that these unfortunate people were subjects, not slaves. The emperor thereupon called a halt to the practice. Grateful for Yang’s solicitous intercession, the dwarfs set up images of their benefactor and offered sacrifice. The cult of Yang as god of happiness gradually spread throughout China. Compare Fuxing.
