Vasudeva,  in Hindu mythology, the patronymic of the deity Krishna, a son of Vasudeva. The worshippers of Vasudeva-Krishna formed one of the earliest theistic devotional movements within Hinduism. When they merged with another group, the Bhagavata, they represented the beginnings of modern Vaishnavism, worship of the god Vishnu.
A significant 2nd-century-bce inscription at Besnagar, near Vidisha (Bhilsa), Madhya Pradesh, refers to a column topped by a figure of Garuda (the vahana, emblem or mount, of Vishnu), erected in honour of Vasudeva by the Indo-Greek ambassador Heliodorus, who termed himself a “Bhagavata.” Although in the earliest parts of the Mahabharata the divinity of Krishna appears to be still open to doubt, Vasudeva-Krishna was clearly identified with Vishnu by the time of the writing of the Bhagavadgita (1st or 2nd century ce).
