Richard Corbet,  (born 1582, Ewell, Surrey—died July 28, 1635, Norwich, Eng.), bishop of Oxford and Norwich and one of the most fashionable minor Caroline poets. His memory has survived through the writings of John Aubrey, late-17th-century biographer, and his poem “Faeries Farewell.” Other of his verses are connected with Christ Church, Oxford, where he was educated (including the long “Iter Boreale,” in heroic couplets). No edition of his poems appeared till 1647. Corbet was successively bishop of Oxford (1628) and Norwich (1632), posts he owed largely to patrons and friends. Although he was anti-Puritan, he did little to repress Puritan activities around Norwich.
