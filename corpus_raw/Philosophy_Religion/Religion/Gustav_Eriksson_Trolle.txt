Gustav Trolle,  (baptized Sept. 21, 1488—died 1535, Flensburg, Schleswig [now in Germany]), Swedish archbishop who instigated the Stockholm Bloodbath of 1520—the mass execution of 82 Swedish nobles and bishops who had fought against union with Denmark-Norway.
Trolle became archbishop of Sweden in 1514. As head of the council of state, he led the party favouring the election of King Christian II of Denmark-Norway as Swedish king. Opposing this course was Sten Sture the Younger, the Swedish regent, who succeeded in having Trolle deposed in 1517, inaugurating a period of civil war in which the archbishop was imprisoned and his official estate destroyed.
In 1518 Christian II intervened with papal approval and had Trolle reinstated. By the autumn of 1520, after Sture’s death in battle, his followers recognized Christian II as king and were granted amnesty. At Trolle’s insistence, however, Christian had the party leaders tried and executed for heresy in November 1520 in the Stockholm Bloodbath. Resistance to Christian was immediately rekindled, and Trolle was forced to flee to Denmark. When Christian was deposed in 1523, Trolle joined him in exile and participated in his ill-fated efforts to regain his throne. In the last of these, the Count’s War (1533–36), Trolle was wounded and captured in the Battle of Øksnebjerg (June 1535). He died shortly thereafter.
