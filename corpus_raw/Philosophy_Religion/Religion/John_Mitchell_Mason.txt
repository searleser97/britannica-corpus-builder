John Mitchell Mason,  (born March 19, 1770, New York City—died  Dec. 26, 1829, New York City), U.S. minister and educator, who is best known for his work in raising standards of Protestant theological education in the U.S. He also was noted for his prowess as an orator.
Mason developed a plan for theological education and in 1804 founded a seminary of the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church in New York City. He believed that the entire student—body, mind, and spirit—should be strengthened, that Scriptures should be studied in their original languages, that a teacher should aid the student in making up his own mind, and that intellectual creativity was more important than the absorption of inflexible dogma. His collected writings were published in four volumes (1832; enlarged 1849).
Mason became president of Dickinson College, Carlisle, Pa. (1821–24); he was also a trustee (1795–1811, 1812–24) and provost (teacher and administrator) of Columbia College (1811–16). In addition, he served as pastor of two churches in New York City.
