Lankavatara-sutra, (Sanskrit:  “Sutra of the Appearance of the Good Doctrine in Lanka”) in full Saddharma-lankavatara-sutra,  distinctive and influential philosophical discourse in the Mahayana Buddhist tradition that is said to have been preached by the Buddha in the mythical city Lanka. Dating from perhaps the 4th century, although parts of it may be earlier, it is the chief canonical exposition of Vijnanavada (“Doctrine of Consciousness”), or subjective idealism. It teaches, in other words, that the world is an illusory reflection of ultimate, undifferentiated mind and that this truth suddenly becomes an inner realization in concentrated meditation.
The thought of the Lankavatara-sutra is reflected in the Yogachara school and provides some of the philosophical background of Zen. It is distinct from two other main thrusts in Mahayana, the Prajnaparamita (“Perfection of Wisdom”) emphasis and the worship of Amitabha, the Buddha of Infinite Light. The sutra was first translated into Chinese in the 5th century and has been the subject of many treatises and commentaries.
