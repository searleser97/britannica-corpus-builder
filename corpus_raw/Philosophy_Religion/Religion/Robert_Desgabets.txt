Robert Desgabets,  (born 1610—died 1678), French Benedictine monk, writer, philosopher, and scientist who applied the ideas and methods of René Descartes to theology and philosophy. Desgabets held that the bread of the Eucharist is penetrated by the soul of Christ in the same way that, according to Descartes, the soul animates the human body. Basing his philosophy on the Cartesian body-mind duality, he maintained that thought depends on the union of the mind with the body.
