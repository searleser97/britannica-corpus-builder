Kalakacaryakatha, (Sanskrit: “The Story of the Teacher Kalaka”)  a noncanonical work of the Shvetambara (“White-robed”) sect of Jainism, a religion of India.
The Kalaka (or Kalakacarya) cycle of legends first appeared in the 12th century ce or earlier, and versions have been recorded in Sanskrit, Prakrit, Apabhramsha, Gujarati, and other south Asian languages. Four separate episodes of the career of the teacher Kalaka are generally treated in the numerous versions of the legend: his overthrow, with the help of the Shakas, of the wicked king Gandabhilla of Ujjayini (modern Ujjain), who had abducted Kalaka’s sister, the nun Sarasvati; the shift of the date of the Paryushana festival forward by one night; Kalaka’s reproof of the conceited monk Sagaracandra, his disciple’s disciple; and Kalaka’s exposition of the nigoda doctrine relating to minute organisms before Shakra (Indra), the king of the gods. Manuscripts of the legends were often illustrated, and thus are a repository of the western Indian style of miniature painting from the 12th to 16th century.
It was long suspected that there were three separate teachers known as Kalaka who inspired these legends. Research in the 20th century has shown, however, that there was indeed a single Kalaka, identified with Arya Shyama, a historical figure who composed several texts and lived a few decades before 57 bce.
