Parilia,  ancient Roman festival celebrated annually on April 21 in honour of the god and goddess Pales, the protectors of flocks and herds.
The festival, basically a purification rite for herdsmen, beasts, and stalls, was at first celebrated by the early kings of Rome, later by the pontifex maximus, or chief priest. The Vestal Virgins opened the festival by distributing straw and the ashes and blood of sacrificial animals. Ritual cleaning, anointment, and adornment of herds and stalls followed, together with offerings of simple foods. The celebrants jumped over a bonfire three times to complete the purification, and an open-air feast ended the festival.
According to later tradition, April 21 was the day on which Romulus began building the city of Rome and was thus celebrated as the dies natalis of the city.
