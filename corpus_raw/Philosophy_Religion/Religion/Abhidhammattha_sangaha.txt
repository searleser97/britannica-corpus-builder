Abhidhammattha-sangaha, (Pāli: “Summary of the Meaning of Abhidhamma”)  a highly popular primer, or digest, of the Abhidhamma corpus (the scholastic section of the canon) of the Theravada tradition. The Abhidhammattha-sangaha was composed in India or in Myanmar (Burma), the chief centre for Abhidhamma studies. Written in Pali by the monk Anuruddha, it dates from no earlier than the 8th century and probably from the 11th or 12th.
The Abhidhammattha-sangaha is a handbook rather than an expository work; it is extremely condensed, dealing in fewer than 50 pages with the entire contents of the seven texts of the Abhidhamma Pitaka. It is the most widely read work of its kind, is held in very high esteem, especially in Myanmar and Sri Lanka (Ceylon), and has been the subject of an extensive exegetical literature in the centuries since its composition.
The subject matter of the Abhidhammattha-sangaha includes enumerations of 89 classes of consciousness, 52 mental properties in various combinations, the qualities of matter, the kinds of relations between phenomena, the varieties of rebirth, and a number of meditation exercises. The purpose of the analysis contained within the Abhidhammattha-sangaha is to elicit a realization of the impermanence of all things, leading to enlightenment and emancipation.
