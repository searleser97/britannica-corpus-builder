Peko,   in Estonian religion, an agricultural deity who aided the growth of grain, especially barley. Peko was represented by a wax image that was kept buried in the grain in the granary and brought out in early spring for a ritual of agricultural increase. An entire village might participate in such a ceremony, for which the food and beer were furnished in common. After the ceremonial feast, leftovers would be distributed among the poor, and the men would engage in ritual wrestling or fence jumping to determine who would be the host for Peko in the following year. The first one to get a bleeding wound would take Peko home and store him in his granary. The word Peko itself is thought to derive from the name of the Swedish deity Beyggvir, in turn deriving from bjugg (“barley”), which in its earliest form was beggwu.
