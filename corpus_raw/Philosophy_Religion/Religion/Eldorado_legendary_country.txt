Eldorado, (Spanish: “The Gilded One”) , also spelled El Dorado,  originally, the legendary ruler of an Indian town near Bogotá, who was believed to plaster his naked body with gold dust during festivals, then plunge into Lake Guatavita to wash off the dust after the ceremonies; his subjects threw jewels and golden objects into the lake. Spanish conquistadores heard the tale before 1530, and one of them reported that he had visited Eldorado himself in a city called Omagua. In 1538 Spaniards from the Caribbean and from Peru and Germans from Venezuela converged on the Bogotá highlands in search of the “gilded man.” No trace of him was found, but the area remained under Spanish rule.
As the search continued into the Orinoco and Amazon valleys, Eldorado came to mean an entire fabulous country of gold, with legendary cities named Manoa and Omagua. In this quest, Gonzalo Pizarro crossed the Andes from Quito (1539), Francisco de Orellana sailed down the Napo and the Amazon (1541–42), and Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada explored eastward from Bogotá (1569–72). Sir Walter Raleigh searched for Manoa in the Orinoco lowlands (1595), while Spaniards sought Omagua nearby. In 1603 the Portuguese Pêro Coelho de Sousa explored northward from Pernambuco, and the golden city of Eldorado was shown on maps of Brazil and the Guianas for years thereafter.
Eldorado was only one of the many mythical regions of great riches—Cíbola, Quivira, the City of the Caesars, and Otro Méjico being among the others. The search for these led to the rapid exploration and conquest of much of the Americas by Spaniards and others. Since then, Eldorado has come to mean any place where wealth can be quickly and easily gained. The name was given to towns in Latin America and the United States and to a California county. The story is often mentioned in literature, as in Milton’s Paradise Lost and Voltaire’s Candide.
