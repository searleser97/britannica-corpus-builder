Chaim Potok, original name Herman Harold Potok,  (born February 17, 1929, New York, New York, U.S.—died July 23, 2002, Merion, Pennsylvania), American rabbi and author whose novels introduced to American fiction the spiritual and cultural life of Orthodox Jews.
The son of Polish immigrants, Potok was reared in an Orthodox home and attended religious schools. As a young man, he was drawn to the less restrictive Conservative doctrine; after graduation from Yeshiva University in 1950 and the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in 1954 (both in New York City), he was ordained a Conservative rabbi. He taught at Jewish institutions of higher learning until he was named managing editor of Conservative Judaism in 1964. He later attended the University of Pennsylvania and in 1965 became editor in chief of the Jewish Publication Society of America, a post he held until 1974, when he became special-projects editor. Throughout his publishing career Potok wrote scholarly and popular articles and reviews.
Potok’s first novel was The Chosen (1967; film, 1981). It was the first book from a major publisher to portray Orthodox Judaism in the United States. The author established his reputation with this story of a Hasidic rabbi’s son and the son’s friend, whose humane Orthodox father encourages him to study secular subjects. The popular book was praised for its vivid rendering of the closed Hasidic community; some thought it an allegory of the survival of Judaism. The Promise (1969) followed the same characters to young adulthood. Potok again turned to the Hasidim in My Name Is Asher Lev (1972), which tells of a young artist in conflict with the traditions of his family and community.
Potok’s next four novels, the autobiographical In the Beginning (1975), The Book of Lights (1981), Davita’s Harp (1985), and The Gift of Asher Lev (1990), also examine the conflict between religious and secular interests. I Am the Clay appeared in 1992, the illustrated The Tree of Here in 1993, The Sky of Now in 1995, and Old Men at Midnight, three connected novellas, in 2001. Notable among Potok’s nonfiction writings are Wanderings: Chaim Potok’s History of the Jews (1978), in which the author combines impressive scholarship with dramatic narrative, and The Gates of November (1996), a chronicle of a Soviet Jewish family and the rise and fall of the Soviet Union.
