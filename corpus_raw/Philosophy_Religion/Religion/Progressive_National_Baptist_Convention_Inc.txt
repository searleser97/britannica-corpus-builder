Progressive National Baptist Convention, Inc.,,   association of black Baptist churches, organized in 1961 at Cincinnati, Ohio, U.S. It developed from a group of black Baptists who left the National Baptist Convention, U.S.A., Inc., because they disagreed with the procedure for electing officers of the convention. The first annual convention of the new church was held in 1962.
