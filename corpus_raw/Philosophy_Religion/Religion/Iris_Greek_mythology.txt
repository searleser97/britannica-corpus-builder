Iris,  in Greek mythology, the personification of the rainbow and (in Homer’s Iliad, for example) a messenger of the gods. According to the Greek poet Hesiod, she was the daughter of Thaumas and the ocean nymph Electra. In Hesiod’s works, at least, she had the additional duty of carrying water from the River Styx in a ewer whenever the gods had to take a solemn oath. The water would render unconscious for one year any god or goddess who lied. In art, Iris was normally portrayed with wings, and her attributes were the herald’s staff and a vase. She was shown serving wine to the gods or escorting them to the wedding of Peleus and Thetis.
