Madog Ab Owain Gwynedd,  Madog also spelled Madoc,  (flourished  1170), legendary voyager to America, a son (if he existed at all) of Owain Gwynedd (d. 1170), prince of Gwynedd, in North Wales.
A quarrel among Owain’s sons over the distribution of their late father’s estate led Madog to sail to Ireland and then westward. In a year or so he returned to Wales and assembled a group to colonize the land he had discovered. The party sailed west in 10 ships and was not seen again. The oldest extant accounts of Madog are in Richard Hakluyt’s Voyages (1582) and David Powel’s The Historie of Cambria (1584). Hakluyt believed Madog had landed in Florida. In Letters and Notes on the Manners, Customs, and Condition of the North American Indians (1841), George Catlin surmised that Madog’s expedition had reached the upper Missouri River valley and that its members were the ancestors of the Mandan Indians. There is a tradition of a “white Indian” settlement at Louisville, Ky., and several 17th- and 18th-century reports were published concerning encounters of frontiersmen with Welsh-speaking Indians. Most anthropologists reject the idea of pre-Columbian European contacts with American Indians, but the evidence is not conclusive. The story is the basis of the epic poem Madoc (1805) by the English poet Robert Southey.
