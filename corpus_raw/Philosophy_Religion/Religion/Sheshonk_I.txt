Sheshonk I, also spelled Shoshenq or Shishak,  (flourished 10th century bce), first king (reigned 945–924 bce) of the 22nd dynasty of ancient Egypt (see ancient Egypt: the 22nd and 23rd dynasties).
Sheshonk came from a line of princes or sheikhs of Libyan tribal descent whose title was “great chief of the Meshwesh” and who appear to have settled in Bubastis in the eastern Nile River delta. He was a general under Psusennes II, the last king of the 21st dynasty (1075–c. 950 bce), and probably ascended the throne without a struggle, making Bubastis his residence and marrying his son Osorkon to a daughter of Psusennes II.
According to the Bible, “Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem” (1 Kings 14:25–26) about 930 bce in support of Jeroboam, the pretender who challenged the right of Solomon’s son Rehoboam to succeed to the Israelite throne. Sheshonk’s victories in Palestine were celebrated by reliefs and inscriptions at Karnak. Although the biblical account reported the looting of the palace and temple, the name Jerusalem did not survive in the Egyptian record. A fragment bearing Sheshonk’s name was found at Megiddo.
