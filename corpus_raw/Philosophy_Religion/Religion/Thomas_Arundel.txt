Thomas Arundel,  (born 1353—died February 19, 1414), English statesman and archbishop of Canterbury who aided the opponents of King Richard II. During the reign of King Henry IV, Arundel vigorously suppressed the Lollards.
His father was Richard Fitzalan, 3rd earl of Arundel, and his mother was a member of the powerful house of Lancaster. He became bishop of Ely in 1374, and during the early years of the reign of Richard II he sided with the nobles opposed to the king. This party forced Richard to make Arundel chancellor of England (1386) and archbishop of York (1388) until, in 1389, he was able to throw off control by the nobles and remove Arundel from office. After making peace with his opponents, Richard reappointed Arundel to the chancellorship in 1391, but Arundel resigned in 1396 to become archbishop of Canterbury. In the following year the king again deprived Arundel of his see and banished him from the kingdom. Arundel joined Henry of Bolingbroke in exile and returned to England in 1399 when Bolingbroke invaded the country, defeated Richard, and ascended the throne as Henry IV.
Resuming his duties at Canterbury, Arundel initiated against the Lollards (followers of John Wycliffe) a campaign that resulted in the burning of several of them; in 1413 he led proceedings against the Lollard leader Sir John Oldcastle, who was condemned to death. In addition, Arundel served as Henry’s chancellor from 1407 to 1409 and in 1412–13.
