Quaker, byname of Friend,  member of the Society of Friends, or Friends church, a Christian group that stresses the guidance of the Holy Spirit, that rejects outward rites and an ordained ministry, and that has a long tradition of actively working for peace and opposing war. George Fox, founder of the Society of Friends in England, recorded that in 1650 “Justice Bennet of Derby first called us Quakers because we bid them tremble at the word of God.” It is likely that the name, originally derisive, was also used because many early Friends, like other religious enthusiasts, themselves trembled in their religious meetings and showed other physical manifestations of religious emotion. Despite early derisive use, Friends used the term of themselves in such phrases as “the people of God in scorn called Quakers.” No embarrassment is caused by using the term to or of Friends today.
