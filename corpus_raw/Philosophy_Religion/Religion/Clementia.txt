Clementia,   in Roman religion, personification of mercy and clemency. Her worship began with her deification as the celebrated virtue of Julius Caesar. The Senate in 44 bc decreed a temple to Caesar and Clementia, in which the cult statue represented the two figures clasping hands. Tiberius was honoured with an altar to his clementia, and the clemency of Caligula received yearly sacrifices. On coins the goddess was usually depicted standing, with a patera (a dish used in sacrifices) in one hand and a sceptre in the other.
