Helenus,  in Greek legend, son of King Priam of Troy and his wife Hecuba, brother of Hector, and twin brother of the prophetess Cassandra. According to Homer he was a seer and warrior. After the death of Paris in the Trojan War, Helenus paid suit to Helen but when she rejected him for his brother, Deiphobus, he withdrew in indignation to Mt. Ida, where he was captured by the Greeks. Other accounts, however, relate that Odysseus captured him, or he surrendered voluntarily in disgust at the treacherous murder of Achilles. He told the Greeks that in order to capture Troy they must gain possession of the Trojans’ image of Pallas Athena (the Palladium), and they must slay Paris with the help of Achilles’ son Neoptolemus and of Philoctetes, who possessed the bow of Heracles.
Helenus and Andromache, his brother Hector’s widow, were later taken by Neoptolemus to Epirus. After Neoptolemus’ death, Helenus married Andromache and became ruler of the country. In Virgil’s Aeneid, Book III, Aeneas visits them on his way to Italy. They have reconstructed a new Troy, and Aeneas must found a new city.
