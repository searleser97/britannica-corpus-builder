The Way International,  Christian evangelical group founded in 1942 as Vesper Chimes, a radio ministry broadcast from Lima, Ohio, by Victor Paul Wierwille (1916–85). Its current headquarters are in New Knoxville, Ohio; estimates of its membership range from 3,000 to 20,000.
As a minister in the Evangelical and Reformed Church (now part of the United Church of Christ), Wierwille developed “The Power for Abundant Living,” a Bible study course, which was published under that name in 1971. He changed the name of his ministry to The Way, Inc., in 1955, and in 1957 he resigned from the Evangelical and Reformed Church to devote himself to his ministry full-time.
The Way experienced significant growth in the early 1970s after some leaders of the Jesus People, a religious movement that spread among young adults in the counterculture, began using Wierwille’s study course and formed independent churches based on these teachings. In 1975 Wierwille merged the new churches with his own organization and named the resulting group The Way International, but it soon separated from the Jesus People over doctrinal differences. In the 1980s The Way International was widely denounced as a cult that “brainwashed” its youthful converts, and opponents of the group made many attempts to draw away members through “deprogramming.” In the 1990s, as the idea that New Religious Movements practiced brainwashing lost favour and the practice of deprogramming disappeared, the group assumed a lower profile.
Wierwille’s teachings combined Christian fundamentalism with Pentecostalism’s emphasis on the supernatural gifts of the Holy Spirit. Although he had at first taught traditional Christian doctrine, Wierwille eventually came to believe that the Trinity was a pagan intrusion into the church. His understanding of the Trinity led him to deny the related belief in the divinity of Jesus. These doctrinal divergences separated The Way International from the main body of the Christian community.
