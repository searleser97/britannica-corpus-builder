Shingaku, (Japanese: “Heart Learning,” or “Mind Learning”)  religious and ethical movement in Japan founded by Ishida Baigan (ad 1685–1744). It pays particular devotion to the Shintō sun goddess Amaterasu and to the uji-gami, or Shintō tutelary deities, but also uses in its popular ethics the teachings of Zen Buddhism and Neo-Confucianism. Moral training consists in cultivating the original purity of the soul. Human nature is identified with the natural moral order, and due respect is paid to existing social traditions. Shingaku flourished throughout Japan until the end of the Tokugawa regime (ad 1603–1867).
