Baalat, also spelled Baʿalat or Baʿalath,  (from West Semitic baʿalat, “lady”), often used as a synonym for the special goddess of a region; also, the chief deity of Byblos. Very little is known of Baalat, “the Lady [of Byblos],” but, because of the close ties between Byblos and Egypt, she was often represented with a typically Egyptian hairstyle, headdress, and costume, and by the 12th dynasty (1991–1786 bc) she was equated with the Egyptian goddess Hathor. To the Greeks, Baalat was a form of the goddess Astarte.
