Clement (III), original name Guibert, or Wibert, of Ravenna, Italian Guiberto, or Wiberto, di Ravenna,  (born c. 1025, Parma, Lombardy—died Sept. 8, 1100, Cività Castellana, Papal States), antipope from 1080 to 1100.
Of noble birth, Guibert served at the German court (c. 1054–55) and became imperial chancellor for Italy (1058–63). As such he supported the election of Bishop Peter Cadalus of Parma as antipope Honorius II (1061). His appointment by Henry IV of Germany as archbishop of Ravenna was confirmed by Pope Alexander II (1073), but he later clashed with Alexander’s successor, St. Gregory VII. When Guibert became the Italian leader of the imperialist faction opposing the Gregorian reform, Gregory excommunicated him. He was elected antipope on June 25, 1080, by a synod convoked by Henry at Brixen, which declared Gregory deposed. He was enthroned when Henry finally seized Rome (March 24, 1084), and on March 31 he crowned Henry emperor. Clement remained antipope throughout the succeeding pontificates of Victor III and Urban II.
