Saint Felix I,  (died Dec. 30, 274, Rome; feast day May 30), pope from 269 to 274. Elected to succeed St. Dionysius, Felix was the author of an important dogmatic letter on the unity of Christ’s Person. He received the emperor Aurelian’s aid in settling a theological dispute between the anti-Trinitarian Paul of Samosata, the deposed bishop of Antioch, and the orthodox Domnus, Paul’s successor. Some claim Felix was buried in the basilica he built on the Via Aurelia; others believe he was buried in the catacomb of St. Calixtus and mistakenly called a martyr.
