Sanūsiyyah, also spelled Senussiya, also called Senussi order,  a Muslim Sufi (mystic) brotherhood established in 1837 by Sīdī Muḥammad ibn ʿAlī al-Sanūsī. In modern history, the head of the Sanūsī brotherhood was king of the federal kingdom of Libya from its creation in 1951 until it was superseded by a Socialist republic in 1969.
The Sanūsiyyah brotherhood was a reformist movement aimed at a return to the simple faith and life of early Islam. As a missionary order, it sought to reform the lives of the Bedouins and convert the non-Muslim peoples of the Sahara and Central Africa. The vast majority of people called Sanūsī did not practice Sanūsī rites but were personal followers of al-Sanūsī al-Kabīr, the Grand Sanūsī, and his family.
By the turn of the 20th century the order was well established among most of the Bedouins and the oasis dwellers of Cyrenaica and the Sirtica, the Libyan Desert of Egypt, southern Tripolitania, Fezzan, the central Sahara, and the Hejaz. The order was strongest in Cyrenaica, where it integrated its religious lodges (zāwiyahs) with the existing tribal system to such an extent that it was able to marshal its members against the Italians in World War I. After the war the Sanūsīs emerged as political spokesmen for the people of Cyrenaica in the negotiations with the British and the Italians and maintained this role throughout World War II. On December 24, 1951, Idris, the head of the Sanūsiyyah, was proclaimed king of an independent United Kingdom of Libya. He was overthrown by a military junta led by Col. Muammar al-Qaddafi on September 1, 1969.
