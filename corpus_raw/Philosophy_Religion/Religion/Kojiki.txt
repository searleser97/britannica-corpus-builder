Kojiki,   (Japanese: “Records of Ancient Matters”), together with the Nihon shoki (q.v.), the first written record in Japan, part of which is considered a sacred text of the Shintō religion. The Kojiki text was compiled from oral tradition in 712.
The Kojiki is an important source book for ceremonies, customs, divination, and magical practices of ancient Japan. It includes myths, legends, and historical accounts of the imperial court from the earliest days of its creation up to the reign of Empress Suiko (628). Much of Shintō thought is based on interpretations of the mythology contained in the Kojiki. It was written using Chinese characters to represent Japanese sounds, inasmuch as no means of recording Japan’s developing spoken language had yet been devised. The religious and ethical values of the Kojiki were rediscovered and reevaluated by Moto-ori Norinaga (1730–1801), who wrote the complete “Annotation of the Kojiki” in 49 volumes. The Kojiki was first translated into English in 1882.
