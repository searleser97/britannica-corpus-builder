Kimbanguist Church, French in full Église De Jésus-christ Sur La Terre Par Le Prophète Simon Kimbangu,   (“Church of Jesus Christ on Earth Through the Prophet Simon Kimbangu”), largest independent African church and the first to be admitted (in 1969) to the World Council of Churches. It takes its name from its founder, Simon Kimbangu, a Baptist mission catechist of the Lower Congo region, who in April 1921 inaugurated a mass movement through his miraculous healings and biblical teaching. In October 1921 Kimbangu was charged with insurrection by the Belgian colonial authorities and imprisoned for life.
In diverse forms the movement continued clandestinely as Ngunzism (Prophetism), and mass deportations during government persecutions only helped to spread it. After toleration in 1957 there emerged the main organized group that was legally recognized in 1959. This church spread widely in Central Africa, transcending class, tribal, and national boundaries, and developed a hierarchical organization under Kimbangu’s three sons, with Nkamba, the prophet’s birth and final burial place, called the New Jerusalem.
The church eschews politics and embraces a puritan ethic, rejecting the use of violence, polygamy, magic and witchcraft, alcohol, tobacco, and dancing. Its worship is Baptist in form, though the institution of Communion was not introduced until 1971. Extensive social services in agriculture, healing, education, youth work, and cooperatives make it a modernizing agency for a membership variously estimated at from 1,000,000 to 3,000,000. Many other smaller, more loosely organized groups in Central Africa also regard Kimbangu as God’s special prophet.
