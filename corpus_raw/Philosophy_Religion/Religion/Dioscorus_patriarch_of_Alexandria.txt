Dioscorus,  (born, Alexandria [Egypt]—died September 4, 454, Gangra, Galatia [now Cankiri, Turkey]), Christian patriarch of Alexandria and eastern prelate who was deposed and excommunicated by the Council of Chalcedon in 451.
Dioscorus was archdeacon at Alexandria when he succeeded St. Cyril as patriarch in 444. He upheld his predecessor’s miaphysitism, or the Christological perspective that both the human and the divine natures of Jesus Christ are equally present in his person in one single nature through the mystery of the Incarnation. When the Synod of Constantinople, presided over by St. Flavian of Constantinople in 448, condemned the monk Eutyches for his promotion of what later became known as the Eutychian heresy (a form of monophysitism that emphasized the divine nature of Jesus Christ at the expense of his human nature), Dioscorus sided with the synod. However, he became subsequently convinced that Eutyches had rejected his argument about Christ’s human nature. The following year, with the support of the Eastern Roman emperor Theodosius II, Dioscorus convened the Second Council of Ephesus (later denounced as the “Robber Synod”), where he reinstated Eutyches, deposed Flavian as patriarch of Constantinople, and attempted to excommunicate Pope Leo I the Great for his condemnation of Eutyches.
In 451 the Council of Chalcedon, which condemned monophysitism, deposed Dioscorus for apparent noncanonical measures in his role in Ephesus and exiled him to Gangra. He was not, however, condemned as a heretic.
Dioscorus is revered in the Oriental Orthodox churches as a staunch advocate of miaphysitism. Three of them—the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, the Syriac Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch and All the East, and the Armenian Apostolic Church—venerate him as a saint.
