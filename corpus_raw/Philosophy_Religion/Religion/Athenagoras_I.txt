Athenagoras I, original name Aristokles Spyrou,  (born March 25, 1886, Vasilikón, near Ioánnina, Greece—died  July 7, 1972, Istanbul, Tur.), ecumenical patriarch and archbishop of Constantinople (modern Istanbul) from 1948 to 1972.
Athenagoras was the son of a physician. He attended the seminary on the island of Halki, near Constantinople, and was ordained a deacon in 1910. He then moved to Athens, where he served as archdeacon to the archbishop Meletios, who later became the ecumenical patriarch. From there, Athenagoras’ career in the church progressed through successively higher offices. In 1922 he became metropolitan of Corfu, and in 1930 he became archbishop of the Greek Orthodox Church of North and South America, with a membership of 1,950,000. While in that office, Athenagoras oversaw the establishment of many new parishes and schools, including a seminary for the training of Greek-American priests.
In 1948 Athenagoras was elected ecumenical patriarch and proceeded to become, in the words of Pope Paul VI, “a great protagonist of the reconciliation of all Christians.” At his own initiative, Athenagoras met with Pope Paul VI in Jerusalem in 1964, the first time the leaders of the Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox churches had conferred since 1439. In 1965 the two leaders agreed to a revocation of the mutual excommunication decrees of 1054; this historic event was accomplished through simultaneous services in St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome and the patriarchal church in Constantinople.
