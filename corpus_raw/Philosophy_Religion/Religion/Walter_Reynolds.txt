Walter Reynolds,  (died Nov. 16, 1327), archbishop of Canterbury best known for his political involvement with Edward II.
Reynolds was the son of a Windsor baker. Sometime in the late 13th century he became a clerk, or chaplain, in the service of Edward I. He may have been a tutor to Edward, prince of Wales (later Edward II), with whom he became a favourite. When Prince Edward ascended the throne in 1307, he appointed Reynolds treasurer of England, and in 1308 Reynolds also became bishop of Worcester. When Robert Winchelsey, archbishop of Canterbury, died in May 1313, Edward II prevailed upon Pope Clement V (and, it is believed, bribed him) to appoint Reynolds to the vacant archbishopric; Reynolds was enthroned at Canterbury in February 1314. In this role he continued the historical struggle for precedence between the archbishops of Canterbury and of York. For a number of reasons, not the least of which was the pope’s granting of extraordinary power to Reynolds, the king and the archbishop of Canterbury began to differ. By about 1323 the bond between Reynolds and Edward II had all but dissolved. Reynolds openly opposed the king in defense of the bishop of Hereford, Adam of Orlton. In the events that concluded Edward’s life and reign, the archbishop played a contemptible part. Eager to be on the winning side in the struggle between the king and the British barons for ascendancy and having fled for safety into Kent, Reynolds returned to London after the imprisonment of Edward II and declared for Edward III, whom he crowned in February 1327.
