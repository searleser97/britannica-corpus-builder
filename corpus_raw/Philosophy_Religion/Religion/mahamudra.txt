Mahamudra, (Sanskrit: “the great seal”)  in Vajrayana (Tantric) Buddhism, the final goal, the union of all apparent dualities. Mudra, in addition to its more usual meaning, has in Vajrayana Buddhism the esoteric meaning of “female partner,” which in turn symbolizes prajna (“wisdom”). The union of the Tantric initiate with his sexual partner signifies the symbolic union of the upaya (the “means,” or method of teaching the goal) with prajna and—on the highest level—the identity of samsara (a concept indicating both the phenomenal world and the process of death and rebirth within it) with nirvana (the extinction of craving and actions that bind one to samsara).
The intentionally ambiguous language of Tantric texts produces many difficulties in interpretation. It is not clear whether erotic terms are to be understood only symbolically or whether the spiritual process is meant to be expressed concretely in physical acts (as is the practice in certain Vajrayana sects). The transcendent meaning of the symbol, however, is always the supreme joy that comes about with the realization of mystical union.
