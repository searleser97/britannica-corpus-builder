Melampus,  in Greek mythology, a seer known for his ability to understand the language of animals. The Bibliothēke (“Library”) erroneously attributed to Apollodorus of Athens relates that Melampus received his supernatural abilities from two snakes that he raised after their parents had been killed by his servants. While he slept, they licked his ears, an act that startled him awake and made him realize that he could understand the language of the birds flying overhead.
Melampus was also credited (by Herodotus in his History) with having introduced the religion of Dionysus to Greece. Elsewhere he is reported to have helped his brother Bias to marry Pero, daughter of King Neleus of Pylos, by meeting the king’s conditions: the man who would marry Pero had to obtain the cattle of Phylacus, the king of Phylace (in Thessaly); although he was caught in the act, Melampus later cured Phylacus’s son of impotence and as a reward was given the cattle he had attempted to steal. According to another legend, Melampus cured the insanity of the daughters of Proetus, prince of Tiryns. According to Pausanias (2nd century ce), there was a shrine to Melampus at Aegosthena (a fortified place in Megara) and an annual festival dedicated to him.
