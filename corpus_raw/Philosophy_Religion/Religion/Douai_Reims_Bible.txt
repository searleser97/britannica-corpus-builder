Douai-Reims Bible, also called Reims-Douai Bible, also spelled Douay-Rheims,  English translation of the Latin Vulgate Bible produced by Roman Catholic scholars in exile from England at the English College in Douai (then in the Spanish Netherlands but later part of France). The New Testament translation was published in 1582 at Reims, where the English College had temporarily relocated in 1578. The Old Testament was translated shortly afterward but was not published until 1609–10, in Douai. The completed work was the only authorized Bible in English for Roman Catholics until the 20th century.
A group of former Oxford men, among them William Cardinal Allen, Gregory Martin (the chief translator), and Thomas Worthington, who provided the Old Testament annotations, was instrumental in its production. They undertook the work—initiated by Allen—in order to provide English-speaking Roman Catholics with an authoritative Roman Catholic version of the Bible, as an alternative to the several Protestant translations then in existence. Roman Catholic practice theretofore had effectively restricted personal use of the Bible, in the Latin Vulgate, to the clergy. The version contained many polemic notes protesting Protestant heresies. Bishop Richard Challoner issued a series of revisions (1749–72) intended to make the translation more easily understandable, and subsequent editions were based upon this revision well into the 20th century.
