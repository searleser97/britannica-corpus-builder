Etrog, (Hebrew: “citron”) also spelled ethrog or esrog, plural etrogim, ethrogim, esrogim, etrogs, ethrogs, or esrogs,  one of four species of plants used during the Jewish celebration of Sukkot (Feast of Booths), a festival of gratitude to God for the bounty of the earth that is celebrated in autumn at the end of the harvest festival. For ritual purposes, the etrog must be perfect in stem and body. It is generally placed in an ornate receptacle and was at one time widely used as a symbol of Judaism.
The other ritual plants used for Sukkot are a palm branch, or lulab (Hebrew lulav), myrtle (Hebrew hadas), and willow (Hebrew ʿarava). During rituals, the etrog is held in the left hand while the palm branch, with myrtle and willow entwined, is held in the right. On the seventh day of Sukkot, the four species are carried seven times around the synagogue. During the singing of specified Psalms (Hallel), the etrog and lulab are waved upward and downward and toward the four points of the compass to indicate the omnipresence of God.
