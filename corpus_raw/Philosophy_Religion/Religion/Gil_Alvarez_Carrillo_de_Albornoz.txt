Gil Álvarez Carrillo de Albornoz,  (born c. 1310, Cuenca, Castile [Spain]—died  Aug. 23/24, 1367, Viterbo, Papal States [Italy]), Spanish cardinal and jurist who paved the way for the papacy’s return to Italy from Avignon, France (where the popes lived from about 1309 to 1377).
Albornoz was first a soldier, then entered the church and became archbishop of Toledo in 1338. He supported the campaigns of Castile’s King Alfonso XI against the Muslims, and his achievements attracted the notice of the papal curia in Avignon. Pope Clement VI appointed him cardinal in 1350. Under Pope Innocent VI he was made legate (1353–57) and vicar-general of Italy with orders to subdue the individual feudal lords and despots who then effectively controlled the Papal States. He was surprisingly successful in his campaigns against them, and by 1357 he felt free to return to Avignon, where his Liber constitutionum Sanctae Matris Ecclesiae (“Book of the Constitution of Holy Mother Church”), also known as the Constitutiones aegidianae, was published. This legal code, or constitution, remained in force in the Papal States until the early 19th century.
In 1358 Albornoz was made papal legate again and sent back to Italy to eliminate the two remaining obstacles to the papacy’s return there. He eradicated the Free Companies, or bands of mercenaries, and he recovered Bologna from the Milanese family of Visconti in 1364. The Papal States were thus reunited, and it seemed safe for the pope to return to Rome, which Urban V did in 1367 on a visit. Urban V also made Albornoz legate of Bologna, where he founded the university for young Spaniards that today bears his name.
