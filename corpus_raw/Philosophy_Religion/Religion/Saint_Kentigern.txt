Saint Kentigern, byname Mungo,  (born, Culross, Fifeshire—died c. 612, possibly Glasgow; feast day January 14), abbot and early Christian missionary, traditionally the first bishop of Glasgow and the evangelist of the ancient Celtic kingdom of Cumbria in southwestern Scotland. Little else is known about him except from late, dubious hagiographies.
According to legend, he was of royal descent, presumably illegitimate, and is reputed to have been a noted, energetic preacher who combated the heresy of Pelagianism (which stressed the goodness of human nature and the freedom of the human will). About 550 he went to Glasgow to convert its British tribes and established a Christian community there. He reportedly had as a patron the king of Strathclyde, for whom he founded the see of Glasgow. The succeeding Christian king Rydderch (Rederech) was overthrown by a pagan reaction, and Kentigern went to Cumbria or, less likely, to Wales. He was recalled to Strathclyde after Rydderch had regained power. Kentigern is also reported to have collaborated with the celebrated missionary abbot St. Columba of Iona (island of the Scottish Inner Hebrides). The Glasgow Cathedral, reputedly containing Kentigern’s grave, stands on the probable site of a church he built.
Although called Kentigern (Celtic: “High Lord”), he is equally known as Mungo (Celtic: “My Dear Friend”), a name said to have been given to him by his teacher Bishop St. Serf. The chief documents on Kentigern’s life were written for two 12th-century bishops of Glasgow. Glasgow’s heraldic arms display a bird, tree, bell, and fish, each of which is associated with an early miracle attributed to Kentigern.
