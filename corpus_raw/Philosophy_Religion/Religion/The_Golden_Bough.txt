The Golden Bough,  a study of comparative religion by Sir James Frazer. It was originally published in two volumes in 1890 with the subtitle A Study in Comparative Religion and was enlarged and republished with the subtitle A Study in Magic and Religion (12 volumes, 1911–15). Aftermath, a Supplement appeared in 1936. This massive work surveys the spiritual beliefs, practices, and institutions of cultures worldwide and posits a natural progression from magic to religion to science. The author provides detailed descriptions of esoteric rites and ceremonies, analysis of recurrent motifs in myth, and interpretation of the “primitive” worldview. Although Frazer’s theory of the evolutionary sequence of magical, religious, and scientific thought is no longer accepted, his work enabled him to synthesize and compare a wider range of information about religious and magical practices than has been achieved subsequently by any other single anthropologist. This material also had a profound impact on Modernist literature and art.
