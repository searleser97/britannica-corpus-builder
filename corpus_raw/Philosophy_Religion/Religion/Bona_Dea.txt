Bona Dea, (Latin: “Good Goddess”)  in Roman religion, deity of fruitfulness, both in the earth and in women. She was identified with various goddesses who had similar functions. The dedication day of her temple on the Aventine was celebrated May 1. Her temple was cared for and attended by women only, and the same was the case at a second celebration, at the beginning of December, in the house of the pontifex maximus, where the pontifex’s wife and the Vestal Virgins ran the ceremony. Wine and myrtle were taboo, and the goddess’s preferred sacrifice was a sow (porca) called damium. The goddess herself was also known as Damia and her priestess as damiatrix. These names are almost certainly Greek, and it is highly probable that the Greek cult of Damia was grafted onto the original cult of the Roman goddess Bona Dea.
Publius Clodius Pulcher was indicted for violating the sanctity of the December ceremonies in 62 bc. (He was disguised as a woman.) He escaped conviction by bribery. His political ally, Julius Caesar, who was pontifex maximus, did not repudiate Clodius, but he did divorce his wife for allowing Clodius to attend the ceremony, saying, “Caesar’s wife must be above suspicion.”
