John Alcock,  (born c. 1430, Beverley, Yorkshire, Eng.—died  Oct. 1, 1500, Wisbech Castle, Isle of Ely, Cambridgeshire), architect, bishop, and statesman who founded Jesus College, Cambridge, and who was regarded as one of the most eminent pre-Reformation English divines.
Educated at Cambridge, Alcock was made dean of Westminster (1461), and thereafter his promotion was rapid in religious and secular posts. In 1470 he was sent as ambassador to the court of Castile. He became successively bishop of Rochester (1472), Worcester (1476), and Ely (1486). He also held the office of chancellor and conducted negotiations with King James III of Scotland, besides filling other posts under Edward IV and Henry VII.
In addition to founding a charity at Beverley, Yorkshire, a grammar school at Kingston-upon-Hull, Yorkshire, and Jesus College, he worked to restore churches and colleges. His surviving published works include Mons perfectionis (1497;“The Hill of Perfection”) and Gallicantus Johannis Alcock episcopi Eliensis ad fratres suos curatos in sinodo apud Barnwell (1498;“Gallicantus [Song of the Cock] of John Alcock Bishop of Ely to His Brother Clergy in the Synod at Barnwell”). The last is a little treatise written in allusion to his name and decorated with figures of the rooster; it is also a good specimen of early English printing and illustration.
