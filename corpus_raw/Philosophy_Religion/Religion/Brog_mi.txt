’Brog-mi,   (born 992, Tibet—died  1072), Tibetan monk and eccentric mystic.
’Brog-mi studied for one year in Nepal and for eight years at Vikramashila (Bihār, India). Coming under the influence of Atīśa, an Indian Buddhist who arrived in Tibet about 1042, ’Brog-mi was a leader in the revival of Tibetan Buddhism. He founded a new and powerful order known as Sa-skya-pa. In 1073 his disciple Dkon-mchog rgyal-po established the great Sa-skya monastery.
