Jean de Lorraine, 1st cardinal de Lorraine,  (born April 9, 1498, Bar, Fr.—died  May 18, 1550, Nogent-sur-Yonne), French cardinal of the celebrated family of Guise, a noted patron of arts and letters. His older brother was Claude de Lorraine, 1st Duke de Guise.
Jean became coadjutor of the bishop of Metz at the age of three and cardinal at 20. In the course of his life, the cardinal held many archbishoprics, bishoprics, and abbeys, some of which he subsequently conferred on his nephews. He was dissolute and extravagant, lavishing vast sums of money on entertainments at the Hôtel de Cluny, his Paris residence; as a patron of scholars, writers, and artists, including Erasmus, Clément Marot, and Benvenuto Cellini, and as an almsgiver, he had few equals. By his munificence he helped to build up a clientele for the Guises at court. The cardinal served King Francis I as councillor and diplomat but toward the end of Francis’ reign fell from favour and retired to Rome. His hopes of becoming pope were never fulfilled. He died at Nogent-sur-Yonne in 1550 as he was returning from Italy.
