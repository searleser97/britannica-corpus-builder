Liturgy of the Preconsecrated Offerings, also called Liturgy of St. Gregory the Great,  a communion service used during Lent in Eastern Orthodox and Eastern-rite Catholic churches; the consecration is omitted, and bread and wine reserved from the previous Sundayâ€™s liturgy are distributed to the faithful.
The Liturgy of the Preconsecrated Offerings is based on the Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom and appeared in Byzantium as early as the 7th century. It begins with the Hesperinos (vespers); omits the Epistle and Gospel, except on feast days; drops the Anaphora, or central portion of the liturgy; and, lacking the consecration, uses bread and wine consecrated at a full liturgy for Communion. The Liturgy of the Preconsecrated Offerings may be used in the Byzantine rite on any day of the Lenten season except Saturday and Sunday, though in actuality it is used only on Wednesdays and Fridays. Maronites and Malabarese use the Liturgy of the Preconsecrated Offerings only on Good Friday, while the Armenian, Coptic, and Ethiopic rites do not have such a liturgy at all.
