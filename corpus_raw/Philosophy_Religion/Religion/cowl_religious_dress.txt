Cowl,   hooded cloak worn by monks, usually the same colour as the habit of the order. Originally a common outer garment worn by both men and women, it was prescribed by St. Benedict for the monks of his order (c. 530). In addition to the typical garment, the separate hood worn by Augustinians, the small hood attached to Franciscansâ€™ habits, and the large, pleated choir robe worn by English Benedictines are also called cowls.
