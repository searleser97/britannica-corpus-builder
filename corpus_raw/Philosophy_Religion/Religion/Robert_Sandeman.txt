Robert Sandeman,  (born April 29, 1718, Perth, Perthshire, Scot.—died April 2, 1771, Danbury, Conn. [U.S.]), British cleric and leader of the Glasite (later called Sandemanian) sect, dissenters from the established Presbyterian Church.
From 1736 to 1744 Sandeman was a linen manufacturer. He married (1737) Catherine, daughter of John Glas, who founded the Glasites. Sandeman became an elder (1744) and served Glasite congregations in Perth, Dundee, Edinburgh, and London. His controversial Letters on Theron and Aspaslio. Addressed to the Author was published in Edinburgh (1757).
In 1764 he sailed to New England, where he and his associates helped establish churches in several towns. He settled in 1767 in Danbury, Conn., which became the sect’s principal centre. He was strongly opposed by New England ministers.
Sandeman was regarded as the principal exponent of Glas’s views, which he developed toward a strict primitive Christianity that exposed them to the charge of antinomianism. In his epitaph, Sandeman expressed this distinctive doctrine on the nature of faith: “That the bare death of Jesus Christ without a thought or deed on the part of man is sufficient to present the chief of sinners spotless before God.”
