Book of Hosea, also spelled Osee,  the first of 12 Old Testament books that bear the names of the Minor Prophets, considered as one book, The Twelve, in the Jewish canon. According to the superscription, Hosea began his prophetic activity during the reign of Jeroboam II (c. 786–746 bc). His prophetic announcements indicate that he was active until near the fall (721 bc) of the northern kingdom of Israel, the scene of his entire ministry.
The text is quite corrupt and contains difficult problems of interpretation. Yahweh’s compassion for Israel, however, is generally the dominant theme. Having “played the harlot” with Canaanite rites and practices, Israel will surely experience Yahweh’s wrath, but not forever. Yahweh will welcome Israel like a husband who takes back an unfaithful wife.
The first chapter of Hosea is a biographical report of the prophet’s marriage to Gomer, a woman of harlotry; the third chapter is an autobiographical account of a marriage to an adulterous woman. Whether the second account is Hosea’s own account of the marriage reported in chapter 1 or whether it refers to a second marriage (remarriage to Gomer?) is much discussed. Whatever the answer, these two accounts are symbolic of Yahweh’s love for Israel, portraying Yahweh’s willingness to renew his covenantal relationship with his people despite their adulterous participation in the Canaanite religion.
The book has a long history of formation and transmission. Much of the material, in oral form, goes back to Hosea himself. The collection of sayings and individual accounts, however, was probably done in Judah at a much later date.
