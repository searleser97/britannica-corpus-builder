Lotus Sutra, Sanskrit Saddharmapuṇḍarīka-sūtra,   (“Lotus of the Good Law [or True Doctrine] Sutra”), one of the earlier Mahāyāna Buddhist texts venerated as the quintessence of truth by the Japanese Tendai (Chinese T’ien-t’ai) and Nichiren sects. The Lotus Sutra is regarded by many others as a religious classic of great beauty and power and one of the most important and most popular works in the Mahāyāna tradition, the form of Buddhism predominant in East Asia. In China it is called the Miao-fa lien-hua ching or Fa-hua Ching and in Japan, Myōhō renge kyō or Hokekyō.
In the Lotus Sutra the Buddha has become the divine eternal Buddha, who attained perfect Enlightenment endless eons ago. His nature as the supreme object of faith and devotion is expressed partly through the language of wondrous powers (e.g., his suddenly making visible thousands of worlds in all directions, each with its own Buddha). In keeping with this exalted Buddhology, the Hīnayāna goals of emancipation and sainthood are reduced to inferior expedients: here all beings are invited to become no less than fully enlightened Buddhas through the grace of innumerable bodhisattvas (“Buddhas-to-be”).
The sutra, composed largely in verse, has a total of 28 chapters and contains many charms and mantras (sacred chants). It was first translated into Chinese in the 3rd century ad and became extremely popular in China and Japan, where common belief held that the simple act of chanting it would bring salvation. The 25th chapter, which describes the glory and special powers of the great bodhisattva of compassion, Avalokitiśvara (Chinese Kuan-yin; Japanese Kannon), has had an important separate life under the name of Kuan-yin Ching (Japanese Kannon-gyō).
