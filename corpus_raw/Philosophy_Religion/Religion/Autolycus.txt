Autolycus,  in Greek mythology, the maternal grandfather, through his daughter Anticleia, of the hero Odysseus. In Homer’s Odyssey the god Hermes rewards Autolycus’s faithful sacrifices to him by granting Autolycus skill in trickery, but later ancient authors made him the god’s son. He was believed to live at the foot of Mount Parnassus and was famous as a thief and swindler. Late sources say that on one occasion Sisyphus (the son of Aeolus), during a visit to Autolycus, recognized his stolen cattle. It is said that on that occasion Sisyphus seduced Autolycus’s daughter Anticleia and that hence Odysseus was really the son of Sisyphus, not of Laertes, whom Anticleia afterward married.
The object of the story probably was to establish the close connection between Hermes, the god of theft and cunning, and the three persons—Sisyphus, Odysseus, and Autolycus—who were the incarnate representations of that practice and quality.
