Rahbānīyah,   (Arabic: “monasticism”), the monastic state, whose admissibility in Islām is much disputed by Muslim theologians. The term appears but once in the Qurʾān: “And we set in the hearts of those who follow Jesus, tenderness and mercy. And monasticism they invented—we did not prescribe it for them—only seeking the good pleasure of God” (57:27). Although this verse has been interpreted in many ways, the general attitude of Muslims is that Islām encourages asceticism and devotion to piety and therefore sanctions rahbānīyah.
The Prophet Muḥammad, however, reputedly remarked: “No rahbānīyah in Islām.” Tradition also attributes to him the saying: “Do not trouble yourselves and God will not trouble you. Some have troubled themselves and God has troubled them. Their likes are in the hermitages and monasteries.” Such traditions were believed by many Muslim authorities on Ḥadīth (sayings of the Prophet) to have been coined by those who believed that Islām does not prohibit monasticism as a form of asceticism but condemns it only when it imitates Christian monasticism’s traditional removal from the secular world.
