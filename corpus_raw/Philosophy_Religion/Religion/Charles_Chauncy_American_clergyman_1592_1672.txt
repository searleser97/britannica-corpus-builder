Charles Chauncy,  (baptized Nov. 5, 1592, Yardley-Bury, Hertfordshire, Eng.—died Feb. 19, 1672, Cambridge, Mass. [U.S.]), American clergyman and second president of Harvard College, described by Cotton Mather as “a most incomparable scholar.”
Chauncy attended Trinity College, Cambridge, and was in turn vicar at Ware and at Marston St. Lawrence, but he twice incurred censure from the authorities for nonconformity. His formal recantation in February 1637 caused him lasting self-reproach. In the same year, he emigrated to America, where he was an associate pastor at Plymouth, then pastor at Scituate, Mass., and, from 1654 until his death, president of Harvard College.
His writings include The Plain Doctrine of the Justification of a Sinner in the Sight of God (1659) and Antisynodalia scripta Americana (1664).
