Shadkhan, (Hebrew: “marriage broker,” or “matchmaker”, ) plural Shadkhanim,  one who undertakes to arrange a Jewish marriage. Such service was virtually indispensible during the Middle Ages when custom frowned on courtships and numerous Jewish families lived in semi-isolation in small communities. Shadkhanim were thus relied upon to gather and evaluate information on the personal qualities and background of potential spouses in order to ensure a felicitous and holy union. Their recompense, fixed by custom, was often a percentage of the dowry. In some of the larger Jewish communities of eastern Europe, the reputation of shadkhanim was marred by the appearance of less than sincere matchmakers who were more interested in turning a financial profit than in honest representation. This type of shadkhan became the subject of countless Jewish jokes. Shadkhanim still exist today but in greatly reduced numbers.
