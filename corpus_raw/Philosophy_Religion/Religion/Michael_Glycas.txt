Michael Glycas, Glycas also spelled Glykas,  (flourished 12th century), Byzantine historian, theologian, and poet, author of a world chronicle and learned theological works.
Little is known of Glycas’s life except that he probably came from the island of Corfu, lived in Constantinople, and was blinded by order of Emperor Manuel I in 1159, apparently either for heretical views or for a political offense. It remains an open question whether he is to be identified with Myron Sikidites, who was involved in a Christological controversy about 1200; some scholars believe they are the same man.
Glycas’s Biblos chronike (“World Chronicle”), from the Creation to the death of Emperor Alexius I (1118), was written for his son; for popular consumption, it is very critical of Alexius I. In addition he wrote a competent and learned commentary on the problems of Holy Scripture, as well as other theological works, a poem, and some letters. His writings are notable for their use of proverbs and the occasional introduction of vernacular expressions.
