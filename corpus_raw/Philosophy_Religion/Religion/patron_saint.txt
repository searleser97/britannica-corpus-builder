Patron saint,  saint to whose protection and intercession a person, a society, a church, or a place is dedicated. The choice is often made on the basis of some real or presumed relationship with the persons or places involved. St. Patrick, for example, is the patron saint of Ireland because he is credited with bringing Christianity to the Irish people. In Roman Catholicism a person often elects a personal patron saint during their confirmation. In some cultures national or local gods are the equivalent of patron saints; e.g., in China Kâ€™uei Hsing, the patron of scholars, reputedly passed his civil-service examination with great distinction and will assist others to do the same.
