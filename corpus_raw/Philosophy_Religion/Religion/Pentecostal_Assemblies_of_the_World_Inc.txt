Pentecostal Assemblies of the World, Inc.,,   Protestant denomination organized in the United States in 1916 after many members withdrew from the Assemblies of God during the Jesus Only controversy, a movement that denied the standard Pentecostal belief in the Trinityâ€”Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Originally an interracial church, it was divided by the splitting off of the whites into the Pentecostal Church, Inc., in 1924. This church merged with the Pentecostal Assemblies of Jesus Christ in 1945 to form the United Pentecostal Church, Inc. The Pentecostal Assemblies of the World, Inc., baptizes in the name of Jesus rather than in the name of the Trinity. In organization it resembles Methodism. Headquarters are in Indianapolis, Ind.
