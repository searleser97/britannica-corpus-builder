Apologist,  any of the Christian writers, primarily in the 2nd century, who attempted to provide a defense of Christianity and criticisms of Greco-Roman culture. Many of their writings were addressed to Roman emperors, and it is probable that the writings were actually sent to government secretaries who were empowered to accept or reject them. Under these circumstances, some of the apologies assumed the form of briefs written to defend Christians against the accusations current in the 2nd century, especially the charges that their religion was novel or godless or that they engaged in immoral cultic practices.
The Apologists usually tried to prove the antiquity of their religion by emphasizing it as the fulfillment of Hebrew Bible prophecy; they argued that their opponents were really godless because they worshipped the gods of mythology; and they insisted on the philosophical nature of their own faith as well as its high ethical teaching. Their works did not present a complete picture of Christianity because they were arguing primarily in response to charges by their opponents.
The Greek Apologists include Quadratus, Aristides, Justin Martyr, Tatian, Apollinaris (bishop of Hierapolis), Melito, Athenagoras, Theophilus, and Clement of Alexandria. Latin Apologists in the 2nd century included Marcus Minucius Felix and Tertullian.
The few early manuscripts of the works of the early Apologists that have survived owe their existence primarily to Byzantine scholars. In 914 Arethas, bishop of Caesarea Cappadociae, had a collection of early apologies copied for his library. Many of the later manuscripts were copied in the 16th century, when the Council of Trent was discussing the nature of tradition. The genuine writings of the Apologists were virtually unknown, however, until the 16th century.
