Norn,  in Germanic mythology, any of a group of supernatural beings who corresponded to the Greek Moirai; they were usually represented as three maidens who spun or wove the fate of men. Some sources name them Urd, Verdandi, and Skuld, perhaps meaning “past,” “present,” and “future.” They were depicted as living by Yggdrasill, the world tree, under Urd’s well and were linked with both good and evil. Being frequently attendant at births, they were sometimes associated with midwifery. The name Norn appears only in Scandinavian sources, but the cult of Nornlike beings occurs in several European folklores. In Norse literature the Norns are sometimes called dísir.
