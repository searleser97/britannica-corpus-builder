Baetylus, also spelled Baetulus,  in Greek religion, a sacred stone or pillar. The word baetylus is of Semitic origin (-bethel). Numerous holy, or fetish, stones existed in antiquity, generally attached to the cult of some particular god and looked upon as his abiding place or symbol. The most famous example is the holy stone at Delphi, the omphalos (“navel”), that reposed in the Temple of Apollo there and supposedly marked the exact centre of the universe. A second stone at Delphi was said to have been the one that the Titan Cronus swallowed; it was thought to be Zeus himself in his symbolic, or baetylic, form.
Sometimes the stones were made into a more regular shape by forming them into pillars or into groups of three pillars. Such columns were sometimes placed before a shrine; others were used as mileposts and often shaped into human form. The baetylus became the parent form for altars and iconic statuary.
