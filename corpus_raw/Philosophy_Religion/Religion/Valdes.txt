Valdes, also called Peter Waldo,  (died c. 1205), medieval French religious leader. A successful merchant, Valdes underwent a religious conversion, gave away his wealth, and began to preach a doctrine of voluntary poverty in Lyon about 1170. In 1179 his vow of poverty was confirmed by Pope Alexander III, but he was subsequently forbidden to preach by Pope Lucius III. In 1182 or 1183 Valdes and his followers—called the Poor, or the Poor of Lyon—were excommunicated for violating the ban on preaching and were banished from the city. They were formally condemned at a church council in 1184 along with other alleged heretics, including the Cathari, against whom Valdes had earlier preached. The severe persecution of the so-called Waldenses in the 13th century forced them to begin traveling and teaching in secret. During the Protestant Reformation, the Waldenses accepted Genevan forms of worship and church organization.
