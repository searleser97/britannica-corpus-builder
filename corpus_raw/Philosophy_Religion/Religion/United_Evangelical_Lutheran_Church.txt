United Evangelical Lutheran Church,   church organized in 1896 in Minneapolis, Minn., as the United Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church in America by merger of the Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church in North America (the North Church) and the Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church Association in America (the Blair Church). “Danish” was dropped from the church’s name in 1946. Both of the merging groups had earlier separated from other Lutheran groups.
The group that formed the North Church had the same early history in the United States as members of the American Evangelical Lutheran Church (formed as the Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church in America in 1874), but the North Church group formed its own church in 1894 because they were Pietists who wished to emphasize personal religious experience. The Blair Church was formed in 1884 by Danish pastors who separated from the Norwegian-Danish Conference to better serve the Danish immigrants.
The United Evangelical Lutheran Church was strongly Pietistic. It stressed the need for repentance, congregations often held prayer meetings, and the laity had a strong role in church government. Niels C. Carlsen, president of the church (1925–50), proposed union negotiations in 1948 that resulted in the merger of the United Evangelical Lutheran Church into the American Lutheran Church (q.v.) in 1960.
