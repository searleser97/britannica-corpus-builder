Cenobitic monasticism,  form of monasticism based on “life in common” (Greek koinobion), characterized by strict discipline, regular worship, and manual work. This communal form of monasticism exists in a number of religious traditions, particularly Christianity and Buddhism.
 St. Pachomius was the author of the first cenobitic rule for Christians in the early 300s, which was later developed by St. Basil the Great (c. 329–379). Cenobitic monasticism was introduced in the West by St. Benedict of Nursia and became the norm of the Benedictine order. In Eastern Christianity its major centres were the monastery of Stoudios in Constantinople (now Istanbul, Turkey) and several monastic communities on Mount Athos, in Greece. Compare idiorrhythmic monasticism.
