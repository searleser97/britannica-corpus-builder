Victor (IV),  original name Gregory Conti,  (flourished  12th century), antipope from March to May 29, 1138. He was a cardinal when chosen pope by a faction opposing Pope Innocent II and led by King Roger II of Sicily and the powerful Pierleoni family.
Victor succeeded the antipope Anacletus II (Pietro Pierleoni), but the renowned mystic abbot St. Bernard of Clairvaux influenced him to reconcile with Innocent. He submitted at Rome on May 29.
