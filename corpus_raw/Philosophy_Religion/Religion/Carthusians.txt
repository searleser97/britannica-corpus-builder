Carthusian, member of Order of Carthusians (O.Cart.),  an order of monks founded by St. Bruno of Cologne in 1084 in the valley of Chartreuse, north of Grenoble, Fr. The Carthusians, who played an important role in the monastic-reform movement of the 11th and 12th centuries, combine the solitary life of hermits with a common life within the walls of a monastery. The monks live in individual cells, where they pray, study, eat, and sleep, gathering in the church only for the night office, morning mass, and afternoon vespers. They eat together on Sundays and at great feasts, when they also have a period of conversation; and once a week they take a long walk together. The monks wear hair shirts and practice total abstinence from meat, and, on Fridays and other fast days, they take only bread and water. The lay brothersâ€™ life is also strictly ordered but is lived in community. At the Grande Chartreuse, as the motherhouse is known, the lay brothers distill the liqueur that bears the name of the motherhouse and of which the profits are distributed to neighbouring religious causes and charities. Carthusian nuns, with a few monasteries in France and Italy, are also strictly cloistered and contemplative. The Carthusians spread slowly, but, by 1521, the order numbered 195 houses in every country of Catholic Europe. Vocations to Carthusian solitude are rare; it is the one form of communal religious life that has never required and never experienced reform.
