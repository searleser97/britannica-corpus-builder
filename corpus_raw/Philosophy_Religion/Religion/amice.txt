Amice,  (derived from Latin amictus, “wrapped around”), liturgical vestment worn under the alb. It is a rectangular piece of white linen held around the neck and shoulders by two bands tied at the waist. Probably derived from a scarf worn by the secular classes, it first appeared as a liturgical garment in the Frankish kingdom in the 9th century and was worn by all clergy as a liturgical garment by the 12th century. Its use today is optional.
The medieval amice was worn as a hood to cover the head and ears. The hood form is retained by some monks. The Eastern church has no comparable vestment.
