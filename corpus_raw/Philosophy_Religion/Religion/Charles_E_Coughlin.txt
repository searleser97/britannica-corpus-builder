Charles E. Coughlin, in full Charles Edward Coughlin, byname Father Coughlin,  (born October 25, 1891, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada—died October 27, 1979, Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, U.S.), U.S. Roman Catholic “radio priest” who in the 1930s developed one of the first deeply loyal mass audiences in radio broadcast history.
Coughlin was the son of a Great Lakes seaman and a seamstress. He was raised in the port town of Hamilton and educated at St. Michael’s College in Toronto. He seriously considered entering politics but finally chose the priesthood, and he was ordained in Detroit in 1923. In 1926 he became pastor of the Shrine of the Little Flower in Royal Oak, Michigan, and in 1930 experimented with the new medium of radio, broadcasting sermons and talks to children in 1930. His political and economic interests began to appear and he soon was attacking Pres. Herbert Hoover and supporting Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt upon his election in 1932. Coughlin rapidly gained listeners. Gradually he began expressing reactionary views that were increasingly anti-New Deal and larded with anti-Semitic rhetoric. He turned on Roosevelt, and a magazine he had founded, Social Justice, carried shrill attacks on communism, Wall Street, and Jews. The magazine was banned from the mails for violating the Espionage Act and ceased publication in 1942. In the same year, the Catholic hierarchy ordered him to stop broadcasting.
Coughlin wrote the books Christ or the Red Serpent (1930), By the Sweat of Thy Brow (1931), and The New Deal in Money (1933). He remained pastor of the Shrine of the Little Flower until his retirement in 1966.
