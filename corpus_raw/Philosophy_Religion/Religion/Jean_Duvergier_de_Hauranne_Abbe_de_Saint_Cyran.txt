Jean Duvergier de Hauranne, abbé de Saint-Cyran,  (born 1581, Bayonne, France—died  Oct. 11, 1643, Paris), French abbot of Saint-Cyran and a founder of the Jansenist movement. His opposition to Cardinal de Richelieu’s policies caused his imprisonment.
Duvergier studied theology at Leuven (Louvain), Belg., then settled in Paris after taking holy orders. His friendship with Cornelius Otto Jansen, a young champion of Augustinianism, led him to oppose the Leuven Jesuits who stood for Scholasticism. The two studied together from 1611 to 1616, after which Jansen returned to Leuven (1617), and Duvergier became confidential secretary to the bishop of Poitiers, where he met Cardinal de Richelieu. He was ordained priest in 1618 and was made sinecure abbot of Saint-Cyran (1620); thereafter, he was generally called Saint-Cyran.
As western Touraine was the headquarters of French Protestantism, Duvergier aimed his learning against the Huguenots. He dreamed of reforming Roman Catholicism on Augustinian lines. His zeal soon forced him out of Paris, where his attempt to gain the support of influential people led to his friendship with the Arnauld family, leading proponents of Jansenism. In 1637 he established a community that became known as the Solitaires (hermits) in the former convent at Port-Royal des Champs near Versailles.
Under the pseudonym of Petrus Aurelius, Duvergier attacked the Jesuits’ precarious utilitarianism and their defiance of episcopal authority. This work so annoyed Richelieu, whom he openly opposed, that Duvergier was imprisoned (May 14, 1638) in Vincennes until Richelieu’s death (1642).
