Jehoiachin, also spelled Joachin, Hebrew Joiachin,  in the Old Testament (II Kings 24), son of King Jehoiakim and king of Judah. He came to the throne at the age of 18 in the midst of the Chaldean invasion of Judah and reigned three months. He was forced to surrender to Nebuchadrezzar II and was taken to Babylon (597 bc), along with 10,000 of his subjects. Nearly 40 years later Nebuchadrezzar died, and his successor released Jehoiachin.
