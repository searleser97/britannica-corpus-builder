Terefah, also spelled terefa, tref, or trefa (from Hebrew ṭaraf, “to tear”), plural terefoth, terefot, or trefot,  any food, food product, or utensil that, according to the Jewish dietary laws (kashruth, q.v.), is not ritually clean or prepared according to law and is thus prohibited as unfit for Jewish use. Terefah is thus the antithesis of kosher (“fit”). The broad connotation of terefah derives from a more specific prohibition against eating meat that has been “torn” by a wild animal (e.g., Exodus 22:31).
Food may be terefah for any of several reasons. Shellfish and pork, for instance, are forbidden at all times. Malformed and sick animals are likewise excluded by the dietary laws. Animals improperly slaughtered or properly slaughtered animals that are found to be diseased upon examination are automatically classified terefah.
