Nirankari, (Punjabi: “Followers of the Formless One”—i.e., God)  religious reform movement within Sikhism. The Nirankari movement was founded by Dayal Das (died 1855), who belonged to a half-Sikh, half-Hindu community in Peshawar. He believed that God is formless, or nirankar (hence the name Nirankari). He also stressed the importance of meditation.
The movement expanded in northwest Punjab, Dayal Das’s native region, under the leadership of his successors Darbara Singh (1855–70) and Ratta Ji (1870–1909). Unlike mainstream Sikhs, but like other groups closely related to them such as the Namdharis, Nirankaris accept the authority of a living guru (spiritual guide) and recognized Dayal Das and his successors as gurus. Its members differ from other Sikhs in their disapproval of the militant brotherhood of the Khalsa. The chief contribution of the Nirankari movement is its standardization of rituals connected with birth, marriage, and death based on the Sikh scriptures. Its following is drawn primarily from among the urban trading communities. The sect has its headquarters at Chandigarh.
