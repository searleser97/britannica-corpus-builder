Leah, also spelled Lia,  in the Old Testament (primarily in Genesis), first wife of Jacob (later Israel) and the traditional ancestor of five of the 12 tribes of Israel. Leah was the mother of six of Jacob’s sons: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Issachar, Zebulun, and Judah; Judah was the ancestor of King David and, according to the New Testament, of Jesus.
After Jacob had deprived his brother Esau of his birthright and blessing, he fled from the wrath of Esau and took refuge in the household of his uncle Laban. There he fell in love with Laban’s younger daughter, Rachel, working for Laban seven years to win her hand. On the night of the nuptial feast, however, Laban deceived him by sending in the “tender-eyed” Leah (“tender-eyed” is an uncertain phrase, possibly denoting poor vision); thus, Laban compelled Jacob to work another seven years for Rachel. Because of this trickery, even after he married Rachel, Jacob did not love Leah, but God consoled her with children before allowing Rachel to become pregnant. Leah lived on after Rachel (though no details of this portion of her life are recorded), and, according to some traditions, she was buried in Hebron on the west bank of the Jordan River.
