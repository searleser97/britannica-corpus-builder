Henry Sacheverell,  (born 1674?—died  June 5, 1724, London, Eng.), English preacher, an assertively narrow-minded supporter of the Anglican state whose impeachment by the Whigs enabled the Tories to win control of the government in 1710. Although he was an obsessive man given to excessive vindictiveness in his writings, his cause was championed by a populace weary of the Whig-directed war against France (War of the Spanish Succession, 1701–14).
Early in the reign of Queen Anne (1702–14), Sacheverell, a fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, began to preach sermons and issue pamphlets violently attacking Whigs, Dissenters, and moderate Tories. In a sermon delivered before the lord mayor and aldermen of London in November 1709, he assailed the powerful Whig minister Sidney Godolphin and condemned the principles of the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Godolphin had Sacheverell tried for sedition by the House of Lords, but Londoners rioted in sympathy with the defendant. He was convicted in March 1710 and suspended from preaching for three years. Invoking the name of their martyr, the Tories swept to victory in the parliamentary elections of October 1710. Upon the expiration of his sentence, Sacheverell was granted a wealthy parish in London by Queen Anne.
