Radha Soami Satsang, also called Radhasvami Satsang,  esoteric religious sect of India that has followers among both Hindus and Sikhs. The sect was founded in 1861 by Shiva Dayal Saheb (also called Shivdayal), a Hindu banker of Agra, who believed that human beings could perfect their highest capabilities only through repetition of the shabda (“sound”), or nam (“name”), of God. The term radha soami signifies the union of the soul with God, the name of God, and the sound heard internally that emanates from God. Great emphasis is placed on the “congregation of truthful people,” the satsang.
On the death of Shiva Dayal Saheb, the Radha Soami sect split into two factions. The main group remained at Agra. The other branch was started by a Sikh disciple of Shiva Dayal Saheb named Jaimal Singh. Members of this latter group are known as the Radha Soamis of Beas, because they have their headquarters on the bank of the Beas River, near Amritsar.
