Tajong-gyo, also called Tanâ€™gun, orTangun Cult,  modern Korean millenarian sect that originated in the late 19th century. Tajong-gyo was formulated by Na Chul. It worships the Lord, the Light, or the Progenitor of the Heaven. The triune deity consists of Great Wisdom, Power, and Virtue, which are parallel to the mind, body, and breath of humanity. The union and harmony of the Heavenly Trinity with the trinity of humanity, adherents believe, will renew humanity and reform society. The trichotomy of man, his universe, and its pursuit of ultimate harmony in terms of yin-yang theory was derived mainly from Neo-Confucianism.
