Philotheos Bryennios,  (born 1833, Istanbul—died  1914, Istanbul), Eastern Church theologian and metropolitan who discovered the Didachē manuscript, an important early Christian document.
Educated at Khálki, Greece, and at the universities of Berlin, Munich, and Leipzig, Bryennios became professor (1861) and then director (1863) of the school at Khálki. In 1867 he was made head of the Great School of the Nation in Istanbul, where he remained until 1875, when he was selected metropolitan of Sérrai, Greece. He became metropolitan of Nicomedia, Tur., in 1877.
While at Istanbul, Bryennios discovered, in 1873, manuscripts containing the Didachē, the two epistles of St. Clement of Rome to the Corinthians, and other important religious documents. Although the Didachē, 16 short chapters dealing largely with morals and church practice, had been known from references in early writers, it was presumed lost. From these discoveries, Bryennios published the first complete text of St. Clement’s epistles (1875) and The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles (1883), both with valuable notes of his own.
