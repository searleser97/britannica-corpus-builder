Platform Sutra,  (Chinese: Liu-Tsu t’an-ch’ing),  important text from the Ch’an (Zen) school of Chinese Buddhism, most likely composed in the 8th century ce. It is attributed to the sixth patriarch of the Ch’an tradition, Hui-neng (638–713), although it is most likely the work of subsequent disciples who sought to legitimate their school by devising a lineage of dharma masters leading back to Bodhidharma, the first patriarch. Hui-neng, who is portrayed in the Platform Sutra as an illiterate commoner, receives the robe of dharma transmission from Hung-jen, the fifth patriarch, secretly, at night, after Hui-neng had successfully defeated Shen-hsiu in a contest of writing dharma verses that revealed true understanding of the nature of enlightenment. Shen-hsiu, a learned monk of the Northern Ch’an school, is portrayed as being outdone by Hui-neng, who is able to grasp the nature of enlightenment simply by hearing the Diamond Sutra (a Mahāyāna Perfection of Wisdom sutra) and by his intuitive grasp of its truth. The Platform Sutra encapsulates the debate between the Northern and Southern Ch’an schools concerning whether enlightenment was gradual, the result of prolonged study and attainment of levels of progress along the Buddhist path (the position of the Northern school), or sudden, an instantaneous grasp of the pure nature of one’s mind (the position of the Southern school). The Platform Sutra thus represents the emergence and eventual dominance of the orthodox, Southern position wherein it is held that the mind is fundamentally pure by nature, and it advocates the twin methods of meditation and insight as the means to attain enlightenment.
