Richard Cameron,  (born c. 1648, Falkland, Fife, Scotland—died July 22, 1680, Airds Moss, Ayrshire), Scottish Covenanter, founder of a religious sect called Cameronians.
Cameron was schoolmaster of his native village until he became chaplain and tutor to Sir William Scott of Harden. In 1673 he began to preach in the open air, under the influence of the Covenanter John Welch, and refused to recognize the rule of the “uncovenanted” King Charles II or to accept the king’s indulgence, which suspended the laws against Nonconformists. The number of his followers was severely reduced by their defeat at Bothwell Bridge (1679), though many joined him in exile in Holland.
Cameron returned at the end of the year, and, on June 22, 1680, he and his friends, including Donald Cargill, Thomas Douglas, and David Hackston, issued the Sanquhar Declaration, calling for war on Charles II and the exclusion of the Roman Catholic James, Duke of York. With only a small group of men, he was easily taken and killed by royal troops at Airds Moss in Ayrshire in the summer of 1680. The prayer he had made before the brief fighting became one of the Covenanters’ songs: “Lord, spare the green and take the ripe.”
