Tijāniyyah,  an especially proselytizing order (tariqa) of Islamic mystics (Sufis) widespread in northern and western Africa and the Sudan. Founded by Aḥmad al-Tijānī (1737–1815), formerly of the Khalwatī order, about 1781 in Fez, Morocco, it places great emphasis on good intentions and actions rather than on elaborate or extreme ritual.
