John Baconthorpe, also called John Bacon, Johannes De Baconthorpe, or Johannes De Anglicus, byname Doctor Resolutus,  (born c. 1290, Baconsthorpe, Norfolk, England—died 1346?, London), English theologian and philosopher who, although he did not subscribe to the heterodox doctrine of the great Muslim philosopher Averroës, was regarded by the Renaissance Averroists as Princeps Averroistarum (“the prince of the Averroists”), and who strongly influenced the Carmelite scholastics for two centuries.
Reared in the Carmelite monastery of Blakeney, Norfolk, Baconthorpe studied at the University of Oxford and at Paris and then taught at the University of Cambridge and possibly at Oxford. He was provincial of the English Carmelites from 1329 to 1333 and thereafter devoted his life to study.
A learned and sharp critic of such theologians as St. Thomas Aquinas, John Duns Scotus, and Henry of Ghent, he failed to oppose them with constructive work. He was, however, familiar with and an excellent commentator on the works of Aristotle and Averroës, favourably interpreting them even though he dissented on fundamentals. Averroism, which was subsequently attacked by orthodox Christian thinkers for advocating the superiority of reason and philosophy over faith and knowledge founded on faith, retained a stronghold in northern Italy, and Baconthorpe’s interpretations of Averroës were treasured by the Renaissance Averroists.
Baconthorpe also wrote commentaries on the Sentences of the theologian Peter Lombard, bishop of Paris (first published in Paris, 1484); on De Trinitate (“On the Trinity”) and De civitate Dei (The City of God) of St. Augustine of Hippo; on De incarnatione Verbi (“On the Incarnation of the Word”) and Cur Deus homo (“Why God Man . . .”) of St. Anselm of Canterbury; and on Matthew and the Pauline Letters. His Quodlibeta (“Miscellanies”) was first published in Venice, 1527.
