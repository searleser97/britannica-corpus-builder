Ibrāhīm al-Naẓẓām, in full Abū Isḥāq Ibrāhīm ibn Sayyār ibn Hanīʾ al-Naẓẓām,  (born c. 775, Basra, Iraq—died c. 845, Baghdad), brilliant Muslim theologian, a man of letters, and a poet, historian, and jurist.
Naẓẓām spent his youth in Basra, moving to Baghdad as a young man. There he studied speculative theology (kalām) under the great Muʿtazilite theologian Abū al-Hudhayl al-ʿAllāf but soon broke away from him to found a school of his own. It seems to have been Naẓẓām who began the struggle against the intellectual influences of Asiatic Hellenism, which the Muʿtazilites represented, a struggle that Muslim thinkers were to continue for centuries. In his theological thinking he was the first to formulate several problems that were of major importance to orthodox Muslim theologians. He convincingly argued that the material world had been created in time by God and did not exist from all eternity to all eternity. Much more important, though, was his discussion of the question of human free will. Muslim theology stressed the transcendent power of God, which brought into question the efficacy of human will in determining human actions. To Naẓẓām a human being consisted of two aspects. One was the material self, which was reflected in actions and movements in the material world and which was under the sway of God’s power. A human being, however, was equally spirit, not subject to the determinism of the material world but free to make choices and thus become morally responsible.
