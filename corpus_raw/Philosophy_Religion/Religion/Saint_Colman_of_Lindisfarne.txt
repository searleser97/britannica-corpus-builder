Saint Colman of Lindisfarne,  (born c. 605, Ireland—died August 8, 676, Inishbofin Island; feast day, Scottish diocese of Argyll and the Isles February 18, elsewhere August 8), important prelate of the early Irish church and monastic founder who led the Celtic party at the crucial Synod of Whitby (663/664), held by the church of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria to decide whether to follow Celtic or Roman usages.
Colman was a monk at the celebrated monastery of Iona—an island of the Inner Hebrides, Argyll—before succeeding St. Finan in 661 to become the third bishop-abbot of the great Northumbrian diocese of Lindisfarne, or Holy Island. His episcopacy witnessed a vital turning point in the development of the Christian church in England.
Though Northumbria had been mainly converted by Celtic missionaries, there was by 662 an influential party that subscribed to Roman church customs, particularly in determining the date of Easter. The Synod of Whitby decided in favour of Rome. Colman objected to the synod’s decisions that brought the English church into closer contact with the European continent. He resigned his see and, with all the Irish and about 30 of the English monks of Lindisfarne, returned to Iona. Between 665 and 667 he founded several Scottish churches, afterward sailing to Ireland with his disciples. They settled on Inishbofin, off the west coast of Ireland, where in 668 Colman built a monastery. He later founded a separate abbey at Mayo for the English monks. He was abbot of both until his death.
Although the Venerable Bede disapproved of the Celtic customs, he had high praise for Colman in his Ecclesiastical History of the English People, considered to be the best source for Colman’s life at Lindisfarne. He is styled Colman of Lindisfarne to distinguish him from numerous other saints named Colman who are listed in the Irish martyrologies.
