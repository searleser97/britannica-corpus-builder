Richard of Saint-Victor,  (born, Scotland/England—died  March 10, 1173, Paris, Fr.), Roman Catholic theologian whose treatises profoundly influenced medieval and modern mysticism.
Richard entered the Abbey of Saint-Victor, Paris, and studied under the scholastic theologian and philosopher Hugh of Saint-Victor, becoming prior in 1162. Although Richard wrote on the Trinity and the Scriptures, he is chiefly remembered for his works on mysticism. With their extensive symbolism, his works synthesize and elaborate the teachings that made the school of Saint-Victor renowned throughout the 12th century.
According to Richard, the soul proceeds from sense perception to ecstasy through imagination, reason, and intuition. The soul employs secular learning as well as divine revelation until it is finally united with God in divine contemplation. Richard’s Benjamin major and Benjamin minor became standard manuals on the practice of mystical spirituality.
His influence on medieval mysticism is evident in the works of the 13th-century Italian theologian St. Bonaventure, who discussed faith as the foundation of mystical contemplation in the tradition of the school of Saint-Victor, and in those of the 14th-century French theologian Jean de Gerson. Richard’s influence on later mysticism is evidenced by the appearance of six editions of his works between 1506 and 1650.
