Meyer Waxman,  (born 1887, Slutzk, Russia—died  March 7, 1969, Miami Beach, Fla., U.S.), Jewish literary historian, rabbi, educator, and scholar.
Trained in Ḥasidic seminaries in Mir and Slutzk, Waxman continued his studies, after emigrating to the United States in 1905, at New York University, Columbia University, and at the Jewish Theological Seminary, where he was ordained in 1913. In 1917 he founded the Teachers Institute of Mizrachi, later affiliated with Yeshiva College (renamed Yeshiva University), New York City. In 1925 he was appointed professor of Hebrew literature and philosophy at Hebrew Theological College, Skokie, Ill., where he remained until 1955, when he retired to New York City.
Waxman’s principal work, History of Jewish Literature, 4 vol. (1930–41; 2nd ed., 5 vol., 1938–60), summarizes and evaluates the various fields of Jewish literature from the end of biblical times to the mid-20th century. His religious studies include the Handbook of Judaism (1947) and Judaism—Religion and Ethics (1958), which were regarded as standard works. Many of his hundreds of articles in English, Hebrew, and Yiddish on the history of Jewish thought and the history of Jewish literature are in Ketavim nivharim, 2 vol. (1943–44; “Special Masterpieces”), Galut ve-Geʿullah (1952; “Diaspora and Return”), and More ha-dorot (1963; “Teacher of the Generations”). Among his early works are Philosophy of Don Hasdai Crescas (1920) and a translation of Moses Hess’s Rome and Jerusalem (1918).
