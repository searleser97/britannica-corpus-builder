Nilus Cabasilas,  (born c. 1298, Thessalonica, Byzantine Empire—died c. 1363, Constantinople), Greek Orthodox metropolitan, theologian, and scholar, whose treatises critical of medieval Latin theology became classical apologies for the Orthodox tradition of the Byzantine church. His support of Greek monastic spirituality furthered the ascetic tradition in the Eastern church.
Cabasilas’ principal work was a voluminous tract, De processione Spiritus Sancti (“On the Procession of the Holy Spirit”), in which he presented the Greek Orthodox speculative view of the Trinity (one God in three persons), emphasizing the question of the Holy Spirit’s coming forth from the Father. Rejecting the variant position of the Latin church, as summarized by Thomas Aquinas, De processione became a standard apologetic text for Eastern Orthodoxy.
Cabasilas’ philosophical background influenced his attitude toward the controversy over the teaching on mystical prayer advanced by his contemporary, the theologian Gregory Palamas. At first dismissing Palamas’ doctrine as contrary to Aristotelian logic and metaphysics, Nilus later came to favour Hesychast teaching. In 1361 Cabasilas was named metropolitan of Thessalonica, but he died before he could assume jurisdiction.
