Elijah’s cup,  in Judaism, the fifth ceremonial cup of wine poured during the family seder dinner on Passover (Pesaḥ). It is left untouched in honour of Elijah, who, according to tradition, will arrive one day as an unknown guest to herald the advent of the messiah. During the seder dinner, biblical verses are read while the door is briefly opened to welcome Elijah, who, it is further said, will resolve all controversial questions connected with the Law. In this way the seder dinner not only commemorates the historical redemption from Egyptian bondage of the Jewish people (see Exodus) but also calls to mind their future redemption when Elijah and the messiah shall appear.
