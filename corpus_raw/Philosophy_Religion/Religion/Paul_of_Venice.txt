Paul Of Venice, Italian Paolo Veneto, or Paolo Di Venezia, Latin Paulus Venetus, original name Paolo Nicoletti,  (born 1372, Udine, Patriarchate of Aquileia [Italy]—died  June 15, 1429, Padua, Venetian Republic), Italian Augustinian philosopher and theologian who gained recognition as an educator and author of works on logic.
Paul studied at the universities of Oxford and Padua, where he also lectured (1408–15), and became Venetian ambassador to Poland (1413), but difficulties with the Venetian authorities prompted him to sever his ties with Venice. While teaching in Bologna (1424) and Siena (1422, 1427), where he became rector, he introduced the logic of William of Ockham. His principal works include Logica parva (1473), Logica magna (1481), Summa totius philosophiae naturalis (1496), and several discussions on Aristotle. The first two selections are known as Logica duplex, and they were used as a comprehensive textbook during the 15th and 16th centuries.
