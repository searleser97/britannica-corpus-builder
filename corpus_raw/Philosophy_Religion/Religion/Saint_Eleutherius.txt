Saint Eleutherius,  (born, Nicopolis, Epirus, Roman Empire [now in Greece]—died  May 24, 189, Rome; feast day May 26), pope from about 175 to 189. During his pontificate the church was involved in a controversy over Montanism, a movement that arose in Asia Minor among Christians who believed that new spiritual revelations could be achieved through the ecstatic trances of their prophets.
The early Christian writer St. Hegesippus says that Eleutherius was deacon of the Roman church under Pope St. Anicetus (c. 155–c. 166). He was pope in the reign of Commodus (Roman emperor 180–192 and coruler with his father, Marcus Aurelius, 176–180), who was relatively tolerant of the Christians. Eleutherius had been devoting close attention to the Montanist controversy when, in 177, Christians in the Lyon area wrote him expressing their opinion of the teachings of the prophet Montanus. Although the letter has been lost, it is believed to have asked Eleutherius to show mercy but not to compromise with followers of the movement. The churches of Lyon and Vienne, Fr., sent the letter by Bishop St. Irenaeus of Lyon, who was delegated to advise Eleutherius.
The opposition of Eleutherius to the Montanist movement has been noted, but the nature of his mediation in the dispute is not known. Modern historians agree in rejecting the legend that a king of Britain named Lucius wrote Eleutherius asking the pope to send missionaries.
