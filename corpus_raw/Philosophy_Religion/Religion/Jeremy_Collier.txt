Jeremy Collier,  (born Sept. 23, 1650, Stow by Quy, Cambridgeshire, Eng.—died  April 26, 1726, London),  English bishop and leader of the Nonjurors (clergy who refused to take the oaths of allegiance to William III and Mary II in 1689 and who set up a schismatic episcopalian church) and the author of a celebrated attack on the immorality of the stage.
Collier attended Caius College, Cambridge, in 1669 and was ordained priest in 1677. He became chaplain to the countess dowager of Dorset and in 1679 rector of Ampton, near Bury St. Edmunds. He was made lecturer of Gray’s Inn in 1685 but resigned at the Glorious Revolution (1688) and was sent to Newgate for writing a pamphlet supporting James II. Released without trial after several months, he was again imprisoned in November 1692 on suspicion of treasonable correspondence with James but was freed within 10 days. In 1696 he daringly gave absolution on the scaffold to Sir John Friend and Sir William Parkyns, who had been condemned for attempting to assassinate William III. His confederates in this act were imprisoned, but Collier absconded and lived under sentence of outlawry. When the storm subsided, he returned to London.
In his notorious A Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage (1698), Collier attacks William Wycherley, John Dryden, William Congreve, John Vanbrugh, and Thomas D’Urfey, censuring them for indecency, for profane language, for abusing the clergy, and for undermining public morality by sympathetic presentation of vice. An ensuing pamphlet war lasted spasmodically until 1726.
Consecrated in 1713 by George Hickes, the sole survivor of the nonjuring bishops, Collier was created, on July 23, 1716, primus of the church of the Nonjurors. His Reasons for Restoring Some Prayers (1717) recommended the reintroduction of certain usages into the Anglican communion service. The consequent “usages” controversy split the nonjuring community and ultimately extinguished the party. A new Communion Office (1718) embodied the changes required by Collier and was probably chiefly compiled by him.
