Christopher,   (born, Rome [Italy]â€”died  904), antipope from 903 to 904. Once cardinal, he appears in many lists of the popes (including the Liber Pontificalis, edited by Louis Duchesne, and Pontificum Romanorum), but he is now regarded as an antipope. In the summer of 903 he drove Leo V from the papal chair but in January 904 was driven out, in turn, by the supporters of Bishop Sergius, who became Pope Sergius III. His only extant act was the confirming of the abbey of Corbie. It is presumed, particularly according to the writer Eugenius Vulgarius, that Christopher and his victim Leo were strangled in prison. But according to the chronicle of Hermann von Reichenau, Christopher was compelled to live his last days as a monk.
