Matthew Parker,  (born Aug. 6, 1504, Norwich, Norfolk, Eng.—died  May 17, 1575, Lambeth, London), Anglican archbishop of Canterbury (1559–75) who presided over the Elizabethan religious settlement in which the Church of England maintained a distinct identity apart from Roman Catholicism and Protestantism.
Parker studied at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, and was ordained a priest in 1527, though he had already become sympathetic to Lutheranism. From 1535 to 1547 he was dean of a college of priests in Suffolk and from 1544 to 1553 master of Corpus Christi College, occasionally holding other positions concurrently, such as chaplain to Henry VIII (1538) and vice chancellor of the University of Cambridge (1545, 1549). Forced to resign and retire to private life under the Roman Catholic Mary I, he was consecrated archbishop of Canterbury 13 months after Elizabeth I’s accession.
As archbishop, Parker supervised the revision of Archbishop Thomas Cranmer’s 42 doctrinal articles of 1553: the Thirty-Nine Articles (on which the Church of England doctrinally rests) were printed in 1563 and authorized in 1571. He also organized a new translation of the Bible, himself translating Genesis, Matthew, and some Pauline letters; this Bishops’ Bible (1568) was official until the King James Version (1611). The most troubled part of Parker’s primacy involved the increasing conflict with the extremer reformers in the Church of England, known from about 1565 as Precisians, or Puritans (who were not curbed until after his death at age 71).
