Westminster Catechism,  either of two works, the Larger Westminster Catechism and the Shorter Westminster Catechism, used by English-speaking Presbyterians and by some Congregationalists and Baptists. Written by the Westminster Assembly, which met regularly from 1643 until 1649 during the English Civil War, the catechisms were presented to the English Parliament in 1647 and were approved by Parliament in 1648. They lost their official status in England, however, in 1660, when the monarchy was restored and episcopacy was reestablished. The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland authorized their use in July 1648, and the Scottish Parliament authorized them in January 1649.
The Larger Catechism was prepared for the use of ministers and is too detailed and minute for memorizing. It has never been as widely used as the Shorter Catechism.
The Shorter Catechism was prepared primarily for instructing children in the Christian faith. It is composed of a brief introduction on the end, rule, and essence of religion and of 107 questions and answers. It is divided into two parts that discuss (1) the doctrines that Christians are to believe concerning the nature of God and the decrees of God and their executions, and (2) the duties that Christians are to perform in regard to the moral law and in regard to the gospel. The first question and answer of the Shorter Catechism are well known: “What is the chief end of man? To glorify God, and to enjoy him forever.”
