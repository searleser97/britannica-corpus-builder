Justinus Andreas Christian Kerner,   (born Sept. 18, 1786, Ludwigsburg, Württemberg—died  Feb. 21, 1862, Weinsberg), German poet and spiritualist writer. He and the poet Ludwig Uhland founded the so-called Swabian group of late Romantic poets.
After the death of his father (1799), Kerner worked in a cloth factory until he was able to study medicine at Tübingen. There he met Uhland and spent most of his time reading and writing poetry. He became a practicing physician and in 1818 settled in Weinsberg, where he frequently entertained the leading poets of the time; he influenced his contemporaries more by his personality than by his written work.
His first book, Reiseschatten: von dem Schattenspieler Luchs (1811; “Travel Shadows: Of the Shadow Player Luchs”), is characterized by a typically Romantic mixture of poetry and prose, seriousness and humour. The first collection of his Gedichte (“Poems”) in 1826 reveals an uncharacteristic melancholy and mystic longing for death. The influence of the Volkslied (“folk song”) is also clear in this poetry. Interested in somnambulism, he examined the somnambulist and clairvoyant Friederike Hauffe from 1826 to 1829 and published his results in Die Seherin von Prevorst. Eröffnungen über das innere Leben der Menschen und über das Hereinragen einer Geisterwelt in die unsere (1829; The Seer of Prevorst. Disclosures About the Inner Life of Men and the Projection of a Spiritworld into Ours).
Kerner had close relationships with the poets Friedrich Hölderlin and Nikolaus Lenau. He played an important role in gathering Hölderlin’s work for publication, and Lenau considered Kerner a mentor. In 1856 Kerner also published a work on the physician and hypnotist Franz Anton Mesmer and animal magnetism. A fifth and enlarged edition of his poetry, Lyrische Gedichte, appeared in 1854.
