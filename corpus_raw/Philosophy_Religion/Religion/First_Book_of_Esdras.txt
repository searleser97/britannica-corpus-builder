First Book of Esdras, also called Greek Ezra, abbreviation I Esdras,  apocryphal work that was included in the canon of the Septuagint (the Greek version of the Hebrew Bible) but is not part of any modern biblical canon; it is called Greek Ezra by modern scholars to distinguish it from the Old Testament Book of Ezra written in Hebrew. Originally written in Aramaic or Hebrew, I Esdras has survived only in Greek and in a Latin translation made from the Greek.
The work is textually more closely related to the Old Testament than other books of the Apocrypha, for it traces portions of Israel’s history from 621 bc to 444 bc by summarizing II Chronicles 35:1–36:23, the whole of the canonical Book of Ezra, and Nehemiah 7:73–8:12. The only new material is the “Tale of the Three Guardsmen,” a Persian folk story that was slightly altered to fit a Jewish context.
The method used in compiling I Esdras is uncertain, especially because of numerous historical inconsistencies and errors; in several instances it also alters biblical texts. The work was composed sometime in the 2nd century bc, probably by an Egyptian Jew.
Given the historical confusion of I Esdras, many scholars feel that its compiler was more interested in inculcating certain moral and religious ideas than in chronicling Jewish history. In this respect the most important part of the work is the “Tale of the Three Guardsmen,” which asserts the supremacy of the Hebraic God, who is identified with truth. Also emphasized are the observance of the Mosaic Law, the cult of the Temple of Jerusalem, and laws forbidding the marriage of Jews with non-Jews.
The first identifiable quotations from I Esdras are in The Antiquities of the Jews of the 1st-century-ad Jewish historian Josephus, who used it in preference to the canonical Ezra–Nehemiah. The “Tale of the Three Guardsmen” was popular among early Christians, some of whom used its statement about truth to prove that this work prophesied the coming of Christ.
