Sacred clown,   ritual or ceremonial figure, in various preliterate and ancient cultures throughout the world, who represents a reversal of the normal order, an opening to the chaos that preceded creation, especially during New Year festivals. The reversal of normality that is the distinguishing mark of the clown relates him to the powerful world that existed before the present one.
In certain traditions clowning is an apotropaic (averting evil) ritual, a way of deflecting demonic attention from serious religious activities. In other contexts it serves as an initiatory ordeal in which the initiate must persevere through the jests and insults hurled at him.
Though some attempts have been made to discover the religious origins of secular clowns, fools, and jesters, it is the elaborate ritual roles of masked clown societies among such groups as the American Indians that have attracted most attention. The most famous of these are the Koyemshi, the dancing clowns of the Pueblo Indians. Their obscene and sacrilegious actions punctuate the most important religious ceremonies and serve as a sign of the presence of the powerful primordial beings and as a means of social control by their satire of the antisocial behaviour of particular individuals.
