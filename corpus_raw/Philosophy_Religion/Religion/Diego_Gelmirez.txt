Diego Gelmírez,  (born c. 1068—died c. 1139), Spanish bishop and archbishop of Santiago de Compostela, site of the supposed shrine of St. James, which he developed as a place of pilgrimage.
Gelmírez was consecrated bishop of Compostela in 1101, and in 1120 Pope Calixtus II promoted him to archbishop and appointed him papal legate in Spain. Gelmírez’s ambition involved him both in bitter ecclesiastical quarrels and in the civil strife that characterized the minority of Alfonso VII of Castile. On several occasions he narrowly escaped death at the hands of the queen mother Urraca or the burgesses of Santiago, who found him a tyrannical overlord. His ecclesiastical policies also provoked violent conflict within the cathedral chapter.
Gelmírez did much to develop the reputation of Santiago as a pilgrim shrine, as his own wealth and influence was based on it. He reformed what had previously been a lax diocese and, at the Council of Compostela (1124), caused the Peace and Truce of God to be proclaimed for the first time in Castile. In civil war he showed himself to be a competent military commander; and, to defeat Moorish naval attacks on Galicia, he organized a small fleet—the first in medieval Castile. Gelmírez’s inordinate desire to extend his power, however, caused Honorius II, who succeeded Calixtus II in 1124, to deprive him of his legateship. It also incurred the distrust of his former protégé, Alfonso VII, who managed, by devious methods, to lay hands on some of Gelmírez’s great wealth. His influence had considerably declined by the time of his death.
