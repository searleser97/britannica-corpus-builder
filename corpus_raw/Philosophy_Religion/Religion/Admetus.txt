Admetus,   in Greek legend, son of Pheres, king of Pherae in Thessaly. Having sued for the hand of Alcestis, the most beautiful of the daughters of Pelias, king of Iolcos in Thessaly, Admetus was first required to harness a lion and a boar to a chariot. Apollo, who, for having killed the Cyclopes, was temporarily condemned to be a slave to Admetus, befriended him and yoked the animals for Admetus, who thus obtained Alcestis. Finding that Admetus was soon to die, Apollo persuaded the Fates to prolong his life, on the condition that someone could be found to die in his place. Alcestis consented, but she was rescued by Heracles, who successfully wrestled with Death at the grave. The death and resurrection of Alcestis form the subject of many ancient reliefs and vase paintings and of Euripidesâ€™ Alcestis.
