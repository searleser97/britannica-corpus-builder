Prayer of Manasseh,  apocryphal work (noncanonical for Jews and Protestants), one of a collection of songs appended to the Old Testament book of Psalms in several manuscripts of the Septuagint (the Greek version of the Hebrew Bible). The Prayer of Manasseh, best known of the collection, is a penitential prayer written as an extension of 2 Chronicles 33:11â€“13, wherein Manasseh, successor to Hezekiah as king of Judah in the 7th century bc, repents his idolatrous worship of gods other than Yahweh.
