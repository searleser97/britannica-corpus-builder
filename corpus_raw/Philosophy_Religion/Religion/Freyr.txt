Freyr, also spelled Frey, also called Yngvi,  in Norse mythology, the ruler of peace and fertility, rain, and sunshine and the son of the sea god Nj√∂rd. Although originally one of the Vanir tribe, he was included with the Aesir. Gerd, daughter of the giant Gymir, was his wife. Worshiped especially in Sweden, he was also well-known in Norway and Iceland. His sister and female counterpart, Freyja, was goddess of love, fertility, battle, and death. The boar was sacred to both. Freyr and Freyja figure in many lays and stories of medieval Iceland.
