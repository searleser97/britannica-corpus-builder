Honji-suijaku, (Japanese: “original substance, manifest traces”)  Chinese Buddhist idea that was transmitted to Japan, greatly influencing the Shintō understanding of deity, or kami. As developed in the medieval period, the theory reinterpreted Japanese kami as the “manifest traces” of the “original substance” of buddhas or bodhisattvas. Ryōbu (“Dual Aspect”) Shintō is particularly expressive of this principle, and the Yui-itsu school of Shintō chauvinistically reversed the formula to make Japanese kami the “original substance.” This principle generally allowed for the pervasive blending of Shintō and Buddhist divinities and practices, a characteristic of Japanese religious life that continues in contemporary Japan.
