Obadiah of Bertinoro,  (born c. 1450, Bertinoro, Papal States—died  before 1516), Italian rabbinic author whose commentary on the Mishnah (the codification of Jewish Oral Law), incorporating literal explanations from the medieval commentator Rashi and citing rulings from the philosopher Moses Maimonides, is a standard work of Jewish literature and since its first printing in 1548 has been published in almost every edition of the Mishnah.
Bertinoro is also remembered as the author of three celebrated letters describing his three-year journey (1486–88) to Jerusalem and containing invaluable descriptions of the people and customs of the Jewish communities he visited on the way, from Italy to Palestine. The letters, written to Bertinoro’s father and brother during the period 1488–90, have been published under the titles Darkhei Ẓiyyon and HaMassa le-Ereẓ Yisrael and translated into several languages. He lived in Jerusalem almost continuously after 1488, acting as spiritual head of the Jewish community there.
