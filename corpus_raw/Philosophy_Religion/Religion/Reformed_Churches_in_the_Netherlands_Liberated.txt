Reformed Churches in the Netherlands (Liberated), Dutch Gereformeerde Kerken in Nederland (vrijgemaakt), also called Gereformeerde Kerken vrijgemaakt,  Protestant church in the Reformed (Calvinist) tradition that arose in the Netherlands in 1944 out of a doctrinal controversy within the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands (Nederlands Gereformeerde Kerken). Followers of Abraham Kuyper (1837–1920), a Dutch theologian and statesman, promoted teachings on such matters as grace and infant baptism that traditionalists regarded as inconsistent with the three confessions of the Reformation: the Belgic Confession (1561), the Heidelberg Catechism (1563), and the canons (decisions on dogma) passed at the Synod of Dort (1618–19). When a synod (assembly) “bound” church officers and members to acceptance of Kuyper’s views as part of Reformed doctrine, some churches seceded or were expulsed. The new church that emerged kept the name Reformed Churches in the Netherlands but added the word “liberated” (vrijgemaakt) in parentheses to express its break with Kuyper’s views. In the first decade of the 21st century the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands (Liberated) reported more than 125,000 members.
