Pietro Paulo Vergerio, byname Vergerio the Younger, Italian Vergerio Il Giovane,  (born 1497/98, Capodistria, Republic of Venice [now Koper, Slovenia]—died October 4, 1565, Tübingen, Württemberg [Germany]), Italian reformer and most famous of “Old Catholic” bishops in the 16th century who accepted the principles of the Reformation while retaining a historic Roman Catholic episcopate and not withdrawing from the Church.
Educated in jurisprudence at Padua, Vergerio practiced law in Padua, Verona, and Venice but soon turned to an ecclesiastical career, becoming papal nuncio in Germany in 1533; while on visits to Germany he met Martin Luther. He next was awarded a bishopric in Croatia, then in Capodistria, but returned in 1540 to active papal diplomacy. By this time, however, he was under suspicion for Protestant persuasions, and in 1544 and again in 1549 he was denounced before the Venetian inquisition. In the second trial he was convicted of heresy, but he had fled Italy and settled in the Swiss Grisons (1549–53), where he was consecrated in a bishopric, without communion with Rome. Thereafter, he traveled about Europe, notably Württemberg, Prussia, and Poland, all the while publishing polemics and urging reforms.
