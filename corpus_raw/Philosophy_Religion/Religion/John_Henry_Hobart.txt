John Henry Hobart,  (born Sept. 14, 1775, Philadelphia—died  Sept. 12, 1830, Auburn, N.Y., U.S.), U.S. educator, publisher, author, and bishop of the Protestant Episcopal Church whose emphasis upon the discipline of orthodoxy during the inchoate post-Revolutionary period in American history—when all things English were suspect—helped Anglicanism to expand in a new nation without compromising its traditions.
In 1806 in New York City Hobart founded the Protestant Episcopal Theological Society (later the General Theological Seminary), where in 1821 he became professor of pastoral theology and homiletics. Renowned as a preacher, he opposed free thought and liberalism in favour of more orthodox religious and social attitudes. He stressed “Evangelical Truth and Apostolic Order,” strictly observing the Episcopal belief that authority and doctrine should be rooted in apostolic times.
Hobart wrote numerous manuals and founded the Protestant Episcopal Tract Society in 1810 and the Protestant Episcopal Press in 1817. Ordained as a priest in 1801, he was chosen assistant bishop of the diocese of New York in 1811 and became bishop in 1816. The same year he also became rector of Trinity Church, New York City. Hobart’s attitudes, which helped give shape to the growing church in the early years of the United States, were expounded in his Collection of Essays on the Subject of Episcopacy (1806) and An Apology for Apostolic Order and Its Advocates (1807). In 1862 Geneva College, Geneva, N.Y., changed its name to Hobart College to memorialize the support he gave as bishop to its founding in 1822.
