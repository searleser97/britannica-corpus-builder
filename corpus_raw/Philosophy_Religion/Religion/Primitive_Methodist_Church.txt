Primitive Methodist Church,   conservative Protestant church that developed in England. It was formed in 1811 by Hugh Bourne and William Clowes after their expulsion from the Wesleyan Methodist Connection. The Primitive Methodists differed from the Wesleyan Methodists primarily in encouraging camp meetings and lay participation. The Primitive Methodist Church, U.S.A., grew as a result of the work of missionaries of the Primitive Methodist Church of England who settled in the United States in 1829. The American group separated from the British church in 1840, and the English Primitive Methodist Church merged into The Methodist Church in England in 1932.
