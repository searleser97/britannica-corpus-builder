Gilbert Crispin,  (died c. 1117), English cleric, biblical exegete, and proponent of the thought of St. Anselm of Canterbury.
Of noble birth, Gilbert was educated and later became a monk at the monastery of Bec, in Normandy, where Anselm was abbot. Gilbert served as abbot of Westminster from c. 1085 until his death.
Gilbertâ€™s exegesis was deeply influenced by his friendship with Anselm and his acquaintance with a Jew from Mainz. His skillful writings include Disputatio Iudaei et Christiani, in which a dialogue on the Christian faith is carried out between Gilbert and his Jewish acquaintance. Other historical and doctrinal works are De Simoniacis, De Spiritu Sancto, and Disputatio Christiani cum gentilli.
