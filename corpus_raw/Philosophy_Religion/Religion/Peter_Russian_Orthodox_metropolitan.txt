Peter,   (born, Volhynia, Grand Duchy of Lithuania—died  Dec. 20, 1326, Moscow), Russian Orthodox metropolitan of Kiev and Moscow (1308–26) and the first metropolitan to reside in Moscow.
Until Peter’s tenure as metropolitan, the centre of the Russian Orthodox Church had for many years been in Kiev, the ancient capital of Rus, and then for a while in Vladimir. When Peter became metropolitan, he, like his predecessors, lived in no fixed place but rather travelled throughout Russia to promote unity among rival principalities.
His allegiance leaned toward Moscow and its prince, Ivan, whom he believed capable of liberating Russia from Mongol oppression. Ivan began to turn his obscure principality into a religious centre by building a cathedral to the archangel Michael and, following Peter’s suggestion, a cathedral dedicated to the Assumption. Under Ivan’s and Peter’s influence, Moscow became the religious capital of Russia; and its position as the permanent home of the metropolitan was strengthened by Peter’s direction that he be buried in the Cathedral of the Assumption there.
