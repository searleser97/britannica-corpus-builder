József Mindszenty, original name József Pehm,  (born March 29, 1892, Csehimindszent, near Szombathely, Austria-Hungary [now in Hungary]—died  May 6, 1975, Vienna, Austria), Roman Catholic clergyman who personified uncompromising opposition to fascism and communism in Hungary for more than five decades of the 20th century.
Politically active from the time of his ordination as a priest in 1915, Mindszenty was arrested as an enemy of totalitarian governments twice in 1919 and again in 1944, the year in which he was consecrated bishop of Veszprém. In 1945 he was appointed primate of Hungary and archbishop of Esztergom, and in 1946 he was made a cardinal.
His refusal to permit the Roman Catholic schools of Hungary to be secularized prompted the communist government to arrest him in 1948 and convict him in 1949 on charges of treason. Sentenced to life imprisonment, he was set free during the uprising of 1956 and, when the communist government regained control, he sought asylum in the U.S. embassy in Budapest. He spent 15 years in voluntary confinement there, rejected requests from the Vatican to leave Hungary, and relented only in 1971, at the entreaty of the U.S. president Richard M. Nixon. As the guest of the Vatican and, after 1971, in Vienna, he criticized the pope’s attempts to deal with Hungary’s communist regime and in 1974 was retired from his posts as archbishop and primate. His Memoirs were published in 1974. Mindszenty was originally buried in Austria, but in 1991, after the fall of Hungary’s communist government, he was reburied in the Basilica in Esztergom, Hungary.
