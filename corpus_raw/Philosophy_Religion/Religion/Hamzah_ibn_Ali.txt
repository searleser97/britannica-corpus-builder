Ḥamzah ibn ʿAlī, in full Ḥamzah ibn ʿAlī ibn Aḥmad,  also called az-Zūzanī,  (born 985—died  after 1021), one of the founders of the Druze religion. Almost nothing is known of his life before he entered Egypt in 1017. He became a spokesman for the religious convictions of the Fāṭimid caliph al-Ḥākim (the Fāṭimids were the ruling dynasty in Egypt), who was already accorded the position of imām, a divinely appointed and authoritative spokesman for Islam. Al-Ḥākim then claimed to be the embodiment of the Godhead—a state beyond name and beyond good and evil. Ḥamzah in turn assumed the position of imām.
Considerable resistance to these doctrines appeared when they were first preached in 1017, and Ḥamzah went into hiding until 1019, when al-Ḥākim was able to move vigorously to support the new religious movement. Near Cairo, Ḥamzah began to build a strong missionary organization. Cosmic ranks were given to members of its hierarchy, and a class of missionaries was organized to spread the teachings. Ḥamzah claimed to be representing not just another sect but rather an independent religion, one that superseded traditional Islam. Al-Ḥākim disappeared in mysterious circumstances in 1021, and, much persecuted, the Druze cult all but ceased to exist in Egypt. Ḥamzah from hiding claimed that al-Ḥākim had only withdrawn to test the faith of his followers. Ḥamzah’s teachings later provided the ideological foundation for many peasant revolts in Syria, which is the stronghold of the Druzes.
