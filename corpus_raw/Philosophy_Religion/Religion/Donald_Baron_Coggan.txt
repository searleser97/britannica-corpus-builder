Donald, Baron Coggan, in full Baron Donald Frederick Coggan,  (born October 9, 1909, London, England—died May 17, 2000, near Winchester, Hampshire), Anglican archbishop of Canterbury from 1974 to 1980, theologian, educator, and the first Evangelical Anglican to become spiritual leader of the church in more than a century.
Educated at Merchant Taylors’ School, London, and St. John’s College, Cambridge (B.A. 1931), and ordained priest in 1935, Coggan taught Semitic languages at the University of Manchester (1931–34) and at Wycliffe College, Toronto, Ontario (1937–44), and was principal of the London College of Divinity (1944–56). He was consecrated bishop of Bradford in 1956, elevated to archbishop of York in 1961, and succeeded Michael Ramsey as archbishop of Canterbury in 1974. As spiritual leader of the church, Coggan was noted for his progressive views. He was the first archbishop of Canterbury to support the ordination of women; the church eventually admitted women to the priesthood in 1994. He also used his background in Semitic study to foster relations between Christians and Jews, and he publicly denounced racial intolerance and nuclear arms. In 1980 he was elevated to a life peerage as Baron Coggan of Canterbury and of Sissinghurst in the County of Kent.
Among Coggan’s writings are The Ministry of the Word (1945), The Glory of God (1950), Stewards of Grace (1958), Christian Priorities (1963), Convictions (1975), The Name Above All Names (1981), and Mission to the World (1982). He also served on the panel of scholars who produced the New English Bible.
