Chalchiuhtlicue, also spelled Chalchihuitlicue (Nahuatl: She Who Wears a Jade Skirt), also called Matlalcueye (She Who Wears a Green Skirt),  Aztec goddess of rivers, lakes, streams, and other freshwaters. Wife (in some myths, sister) of the rain god Tlaloc, in Aztec cosmology she ruled over the fourth of the previous suns; in her reign, maize (corn) was first used. Like other water deities, she was often associated with serpents.
Not to be confused with Chalchiuhtlicue was Huixtocihuatl (Salt Lady), the goddess of salt water, of the salters guild, and of dissolute women.
