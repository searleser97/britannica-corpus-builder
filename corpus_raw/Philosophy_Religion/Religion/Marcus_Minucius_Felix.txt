Marcus Minucius Felix,  (born, Africa?—died c. 250, Rome), one of the earliest Christian Apologists to write in Latin.
A Roman lawyer, he wrote the Octavius, a dialogue on Providence and Christianity in general, between the skeptic pagan Caecilius Natalis and the Christian Octavius Januarius, Minucius’ friend. Written for educated non-Christians, the arguments are borrowed chiefly from Cicero, especially his De natura deorum (“Concerning the Nature of the Gods”), and Christian material, mainly from the Greek Apologists. The distinction of the treatise lies in its classical refinement rather than in its originality.
The Octavius was written before Bishop St. Cyprian of Carthage’s Quod idola dii non sunt (c. 250; “That Idols Are Not Gods”), which borrows from it, but whether Minucius influenced or was influenced by Tertullian’s Apologeticum and Ad nationes (197; “To the Nations”) remains uncertain.
