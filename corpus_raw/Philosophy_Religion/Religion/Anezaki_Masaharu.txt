Anezaki Masaharu, also called Anezaki Chōfū, Anezaki  also spelled Anesaki,  (born July 25, 1873, Kyōto, Japan—died  July 23, 1949, Atami), Japanese scholar who pioneered in various fields of the history of religions.
After graduating from Tokyo Imperial University (now the University of Tokyo), Anezaki went to India and Europe for further studies (1900–03). Returning to Japan, he was appointed to the chair of science of religion at Tokyo Imperial University.
Anezaki started his academic career as a student of Indian religions, and Buddhism in particular. Before him, studies in Buddhist scriptures had been conducted mostly from an apologetic point of view; he was one of the first to apply the modern objective, historical method to the study of Buddhism. Working from the conviction that the true spirit of Buddhism must be sought in its initial stage, he attempted text criticism of Pāli and Chinese canons in Original Buddhism (1910). He also initiated research in the history of Kirishitan, the specifically Japanese form of Roman Catholic Christianity, during the period it was banned, from the 17th through the mid-19th century. He became increasingly interested in the 15th-century monk Nichiren and published Nichiren, the Buddhist Prophet (1916). Anezaki taught and lectured abroad; the outcome of his Harvard University lectures (1913–15) was History of Japanese Religion (1930), a standard work.
