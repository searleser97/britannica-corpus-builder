Arnulf of Chocques, also called Arnulf Malecorne,  (died 1118), Latin patriarch of Jerusalem in 1099 and again from 1112 until his death. Accompanying the First Crusade as chaplain to Robert I, duke of Normandy, Arnulf won fame as a preacher. Elected patriarch on August 1, 1099, he forced all local Christians to conform with the Latin rite. After Christmas 1099 he was superseded as patriarch by the papal legate Daimbert. During his second term he worked closely with Baldwin I, the Latin king of Jerusalem, and for a time he was suspended for having celebrated Baldwinâ€™s bigamous marriage (1113).
