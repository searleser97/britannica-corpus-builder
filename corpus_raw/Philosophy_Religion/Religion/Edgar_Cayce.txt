Edgar Cayce,  (born March 18, 1877, near Hopkinsville, Kentucky, U.S.â€”died January 3, 1945, Virginia Beach, Virginia), American self-proclaimed faith healer and psychic.
A Sunday-school teacher with little formal education, Cayce began faith healing in the 1920s, using a combination of spiritual readings and homeopathic medicine; many of his cures were said to have been accomplished long-distance. In 1925 he settled in Virginia Beach, where he established a hospital (1928) and the Association for Research and Enlightenment (1931). He also made prophecies (including the destruction of New York City and California), claimed to be able to recall past lives, and promoted belief in the existence of a great civilization in Atlantis some 12,000 years ago.
