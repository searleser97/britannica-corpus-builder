Mahayana-shraddhotpada-shastra, (Sanskrit: “Treatise on the Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana”) also called “The Awakening of Faith”,  relatively brief but influential exposition of the fundamentals of Mahayana Buddhism. Though the work is said to be that of the Sanskrit poet Ashvaghosha, there are no extant Sanskrit copies of the text and no references to it in any texts or commentaries originating in Sanskrit. A Chinese version, entitled Dacheng qixin lun, first appeared about 550 ce, but the provenance and authorship of the original are unknown.
The book contains one of the clearest presentations of the doctrine of the trikaya, or the “three bodies” of the Buddha—the transitory physical body (nirmanakaya), the glorious “bliss body” in paradise (sambhogakaya), and the celestial body of the Buddha (dharmakaya). A number of commentaries have been written, and the work itself is a favourite authority among northern Buddhists.
