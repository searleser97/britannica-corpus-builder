Peter Payne, Czech Petra Payna,  (born c. 1380, Hough-on-the-Hill, Lincolnshire, Eng.—died c. 1455, Prague, Bohemia [now in Czech Republic]), English theologian, diplomat, and follower of the early religious Reformer John Wycliffe; he was a leading figure in securing Bohemia for the Hussites.
About the time Payne was principal of St. Edmund Hall, Oxford (1410–12), he joined the Lollards, and when the influential Lollard soldier Sir John Oldcastle was indicted in 1413, Payne felt it prudent to flee to Bohemia. There he supported the Utraquist Hussites. He became a central figure in the consistory that governed the Hussite church and was entrusted with several diplomatic missions. At the Council of Basel in 1433, he spoke out against state seizure of church property. Taken prisoner at the Battle of Lipany, in 1434, he was soon freed and took part in peace negotiations. With the return of the anti-Hussite king Sigismund to Bohemia, the Hussites were temporarily proscribed, and Payne was expelled from Prague. He was imprisoned for two years in Austria, then ransomed by fellow Hussites to return to Bohemia and participate in unification of the scattered Hussite church. Respected by all factions, he sought in vain to reconcile the extreme Taborites with the elected archbishop, Jan Rokycana. By 1448, when Payne went back to Prague, Rokycana’s party was firmly established. Though he never learned Czech, Payne served the Hussites also through his theological works.
