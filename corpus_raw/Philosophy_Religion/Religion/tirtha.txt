Tirtha, (Sanskrit: “crossing” or “river ford”)  in Hinduism, a holy river, mountain, or other place made sacred through association with a deity or saint. The seven holiest Hindu cities are said to be the sites of events recounted in mythological texts: Kashi (modern Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh), where the god Shiva founded a shrine of purification; Oudh (modern Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh), birthplace of the god Rama; Mathura (in Uttar Pradesh), scene of Krishna’s nativity; Dvaraka (modern Dwarka, Gujarat state), where the adult Krishna ruled as king; Kanchipuram (in Tamil Nadu state), where the temple to the divine mother is built in the shape of a yantra, or sacred diagram; Hardiwar (in Uttar Pradesh), the spot where the Ganges River came to earth; and Ujjain (in Madhya Pradesh), site of a famous Shaivite lingam (sign of Shiva).
Bathing is said to be particularly cleansing of sin when performed in the confluence of two rivers or at the source or joining of one of the seven sacred rivers—the Ganges, the Yamuna, the Godavari, the Narmada, the Indus, the Kaveri, and the mythical Saraswati. The four great abodes of the gods, located at the four corners of India—Badrinatha in the north, Dwarka in the west, Rameswaram in the south, and Puri in the east—attract large numbers of pilgrims yearly. The pithas, or spots that mark where pieces of the body of Shiva’s wife Sati fell to earth, are particularly sacred to the devotees of the goddess Shakti. Special occasions, such as an eclipse of the Sun, a Kumbh Mela (largest of the religious fairs), or the Rathayatra (wagon festival) at the Jagannatha temple in Puri, draw large gatherings.
Hindus undertake a pilgrimage (called a tirthayatra) as an act of devotion, to carry out a vow, to appease a deity, or to seek prosperity. Upon reaching the tirtha, pilgrims will usually bathe (snana), circumambulate the temple or holy place (pradakshina), make an offering, and carry out a rite such as the shraddha ceremony performed in honour of dead ancestors. They will then have their names recorded by the priests who specially cater to the needs of pilgrims, and they will also listen to the evening expositions of music and religious discourses.
