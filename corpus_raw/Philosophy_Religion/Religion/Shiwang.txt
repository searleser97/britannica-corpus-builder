Shiwang, (Chinese: “Ten Kings”) Wade-Giles romanization Shih Wang,  in Chinese mythology, the 10 kings of hell, who preside over fixed regions where the dead are punished by physical tortures appropriate to their crimes. The Chinese hell (diyu; “earth prison”) is principally a Buddhist concept that has been modified by Daoism and indigenous folk beliefs, and the many existing descriptions vary in details.
The first king receives the dead and determines whether or not they require punishment and, if so, to which region they should be sent. Formerly the position of first judge was held by Yanluo Wang (a Chinese form of the Indian lord of death, Yama), but he was demoted to the fifth court because of his leniency. The second king has jurisdiction over the region that punishes dishonest go-betweens, fraudulent trustees, and ignorant doctors. The third king punishes unjust mandarins, forgers, slanderers, and shrews. The fourth king punishes the miserly rich, dishonest tradesmen, and those who know cures but do not divulge them. The fifth king punishes religious sinners, murderers, hunters, fishers, and the lustful. The sixth king punishes those guilty of sacrilege. The seventh king punishes violators of graves and sellers and consumers of human flesh. The eighth king punishes those lacking in filial piety. The ninth punishes arsonists, abortionists, and obscene painters and writers and their clients and oversees the city of those dead by accident (including suicides), from which no one is reborn unless he can find another accident victim to take his place. The 10th king turns the wheel of transmigration that carries the dead to their new existences as either gods, human beings on earth or in hell, good or bad demons, or animals.
The 10 kings and the regions over which they preside are frequently represented in temples of Cheng Huang, the City God.
