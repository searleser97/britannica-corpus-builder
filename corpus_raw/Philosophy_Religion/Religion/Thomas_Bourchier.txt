Thomas Bourchier,  (born c. 1412—died  March 30, 1486, Knole, Kent, Eng.), English cardinal and archbishop of Canterbury who maintained the stability of the English church during the Wars of the Roses (1455–85) between the houses of York and Lancaster.
Bourchier was the son of William Bourchier, made Count of Eu in 1419, and Anne, a granddaughter of King Edward III. Bourchier was bishop of Worcester (1435–43) and of Ely (1443–54). Because he won acceptance from both the feuding Yorkist and Lancastrian parties, he was elected archbishop of Canterbury in 1454. He served as chancellor (1455–56) during the opening months of the Wars of the Roses and arranged a temporary reconciliation between the two sides in 1458. Nevertheless, after the defeat of the Lancastrians in 1461, Bourchier became a loyal supporter of the newly crowned Yorkist monarch Edward IV, who made him a cardinal in 1467. In 1483 he persuaded Edward’s widow to hand over her youngest son, Richard, Duke of York—a potential claimant to the throne—to Richard, Duke of Gloucester, who shortly thereafter usurped the throne as King Richard III. Bourchier was not implicated, however, in the mysterious disappearance of the Duke of York and his elder brother, Edward V, from the Tower of London in August 1483.
