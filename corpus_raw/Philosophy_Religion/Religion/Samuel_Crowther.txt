Samuel Crowther, in full Samuel Ajayi Crowther, Ajayi also spelled Adjai or Ajai,  (born c. 1809, Oshogun, Yoruba region [Nigeria]â€”died December 31, 1891, Lagos, Southern Nigeria), the first African to be ordained by the Church Missionary Society, who was in 1864 consecrated bishop of the Niger territory.
Sold into slavery at the age of 12, Crowther was rescued in mid-passage by a British cruiser and landed at Sierra Leone, where he was educated in a mission school and baptized. In 1842 he went to the Church Missionary College in London, and he received holy orders. Back in the Yoruba country, Crowther worked among his people as a missionary from 1843 to 1851. After accompanying several expeditions to the Niger, he devoted the rest of his life to administrative and evangelistic duties in his newly created diocese of the Niger territory.
