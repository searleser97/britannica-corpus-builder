Rin-chen-bzang-po, also spelled Richen Zampo,  (born 958—died  1055), Tibetan Buddhist monk, called the “Great Translator,” known primarily for his extensive translations of Indian Buddhist texts into Tibetan, thus furthering the subsequent development of Buddhism in Tibet. First sent to India in the late 10th century under Tibetan royal patronage, Rin-chen-bzang-po eventually succeeded in bringing back to Tibet a number of Indian Buddhist monks with whom he then collaborated both in the new translation of Indian Buddhist texts and in the revision of old 8th-century translations. His life’s work includes more than 150 translations, encompassing both canonical works and exegetical treatises.
