Buddhacarita, also spelled Buddhacharita, in full Buddhacarita-kavya-sutra (Sanskrit: “Poetic Discourse on the Acts of the Buddha”),  poetic narrative of the life of the Buddha by the Sanskrit poet Ashvaghosha, one of the finest examples of Buddhist literature. The author, who lived in northern India in the 1st–2nd century ce, created a loving account of the Buddha’s life and teachings, one that—in contrast to other treatments such as the Mahavastu (“Great Story”) and Lalitavistara (“Full Description of the Play [of the Buddha]”)—is both artistically arranged and restrained in its description of miracles. His work also reflects a vast knowledge of Indian mythology and of pre-Buddhist philosophies, plus a court poet’s interest in love, battle, and statecraft. Only the first half of the Buddhacarita remains intact in Sanskrit, but all 28 chapters are preserved in Chinese (5th century) and Tibetan translations.
