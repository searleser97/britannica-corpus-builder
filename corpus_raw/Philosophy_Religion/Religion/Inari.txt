Inari,   in Japanese mythology, god primarily known as the protector of rice cultivation. The god also furthers prosperity and is worshiped particularly by merchants and tradesmen, is the patron deity of swordsmiths and is associated with brothels and entertainers.
In Shintō legends Inari is identified with Uka no Mitama no Kami (“August Spirit of Food”), son of the impetuous storm god, Susanoo. The rice god is also associated in some Shintō shrines with the goddess of food, Ukemochi no Kami; and there is considerable variation in the way in which Inari is depicted, as a bearded man riding a white fox or as a woman with long, flowing hair, carrying sheaves of rice.
The fox, symbolizing both benevolence and malevolence, is sometimes identified with the messenger of Inari, and statues of foxes are found in great numbers both inside and outside shrines dedicated to the rice god. Other characteristics of Inari shrines are their deep red buildings, long rows of votive torii (gateways), and the hōshu-no-tama (a pear-shaped emblem surmounted by flamelike symbols). Most renowned among the numerous Inari shrines throughout Japan is the Fushimi Inari Shrine near Kyōto.
