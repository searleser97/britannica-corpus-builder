Anglican Evangelical,  one who emphasizes biblical faith, personal conversion, piety, and, in general, the Protestant rather than the Catholic heritage of the Anglican Communion. Such persons have also been referred to as low churchmen because they give a “low” place to the importance of the episcopal form of church government, the sacraments, and liturgical worship. The term Low Church was used by about the end of the 17th century, although this emphasis within Anglicanism was evident since the time of King Edward VI (1537–53).
The movement that became known as the Evangelical movement began within the Church of England in the 18th century, although it had many points in common with earlier Low Church attitudes and with 16th- and 17th-century Puritanism. The followers of John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, eventually left the Church of England, but many with very similar beliefs remained within the established church. They emphasized evangelism, social welfare, and missions, and they established the Church Missionary Society (1799) and the Colonial and Continental Church Society (1838). Included among the Evangelicals’ many leaders were the influential Clapham Sect, a group of wealthy lay persons prominent in England from about 1790 to 1830. Many of them were members of Parliament, and they were responsible for ending the slave trade.
In the 19th century the Evangelicals opposed the Oxford Movement, which emphasized the Catholic heritage of Anglicanism. In the 20th century they were influenced by liberalism and the new, scientific methods of studying the Bible. (See Broad Church.) Some continued to stress the verbal inspiration and accuracy of the Bible and became known as conservative Evangelicals. Others, a much larger group, accepted the new learning and became known as liberal Evangelicals. In general, they continued as the Low Church party within the Anglican Communion.
