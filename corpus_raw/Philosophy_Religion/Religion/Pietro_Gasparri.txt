Pietro Gasparri,  (born May 5, 1852, Capovalazza de Ussita, Papal States [Italy]—died  Nov. 18, 1934, Rome, Italy), Italian cardinal who, by appointment of Pope St. Pius X, in 1904 directed the new Code of Canon Law, a systematic arrangement of ecclesiastical law now practiced by the Roman Catholic church.
Ordained in 1877, Gasparri was professor of canon law at the Catholic Institute, Paris (1880–98). In 1907 he was made cardinal, and in 1914 Pope Benedict XV appointed him secretary of state. His new code (Codex Juris Canonici) was promulgated in 1917. He was retained by Pope Pius XI and in 1926 began the secret negotiations with Prime Minister Benito Mussolini of Italy that resulted in the Lateran Treaty (1929), an agreement securing papal independence from Italy.
