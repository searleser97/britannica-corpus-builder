Wu Li, Wade-Giles romanization Wu Li,  (born 1632, Changsu, Jiangsu province, China—died 1718), Chinese painter who was a member of the orthodox school of “literati painting” (wenrenhua) in the early Qing period.
Wu became a convert to Catholicism and in 1681 went to Macao Island (on the southeast coast of China), where, without family obligations after the deaths of his mother and wife and the marriage of his two daughters, he entered the Jesuit order. In 1688 he was ordained as a priest under the name Acunha and was posted as a missionary in Jiangsu. While Wu saw Western prints and paintings, his own paintings were entirely within the Chinese tradition and are always signed with his Chinese name. He studied under the great painter Wang Shimin and was a good friend of the painters Wang Hui and Wang Jian. Wu led a rather retiring life and cultivated the proper Confucian virtues of the ideal cultivated amateur of the literati tradition.
