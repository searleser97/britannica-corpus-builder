Minim, member of Order of Minim Brothers,  an order of friars founded in 1435 by St. Francis of Paola in Calabria, Italy. Members consider humility the primary virtue and regard themselves as the least (minimi) of all the religious. To the traditional vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience they add a fourth vow binding them to abstain from meat, eggs, milk, cheese, fish, and their derivatives. The founder claimed to have received the motto “Charitas” in a vision from the Archangel Michael.
The rule’s original order, based primarily on that of St. Francis of Assisi, was approved by Pope Alexander VI in 1493. The rule was revised a number of times thereafter, becoming less dependent on St. Francis’ rule. The order includes friars, nuns, and laypersons.
The order spread rapidly, especially in Italy and France, its greatest period of expansion occurring in the 16th century, when the Minims controlled more than 400 communities and numbered 9,000 members. Then, during the height of anticlericalism in the 19th century, the Minims fell on hard times and were drastically reduced in numbers and influence. Today the Minims have convents in Italy and Spain and a third order of laypersons in South America.
The Minims devote themselves to prayer, study, and scholarship. They have included several notable teachers, scholars, and pastors, among the best known being Blessed Gaspar de Bono and Father Bernard Boyl (Buil). Father Boyl accompanied Columbus on his second voyage to America and was the first apostolic delegate to America.
