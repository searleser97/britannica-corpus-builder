Plymouth Brethren,  community of Christians whose first congregation was established in Plymouth, Devon, England, in 1831. The movement originated in Ireland and England a few years earlier with groups of Christians who met for prayer and fellowship. Biblical prophecy and the Second Coming of Christ were emphasized. John Nelson Darby, a former clergyman in the Church of Ireland (Anglican), soon became the dominant personality in the movement. He founded groups of Brethren in many parts of the British Isles and in continental Europe, especially in French Switzerland, where he spent the greater part of the period 1838–45.
After Darby returned to England in 1845, disputes over doctrine and church government split the Brethren. Darby’s followers formed a closely knit federation of churches and were known as Exclusive Brethren; the others, called Open Brethren, maintained a congregational form of church government and less rigorous standards for membership. Exclusive Brethren have suffered further divisions.
Brethren of all parties recognize no order of clergy or ministers as distinct from the laity. A communion service is celebrated every Sunday. Practically all groups practice believer’s Baptism, although some Exclusive Brethren, following Darby’s practice, baptize children of members.
The Plymouth Brethren have been active in foreign missionary work, principally in Central Africa, India, and Latin America. Brethren are found throughout the English-speaking world and in most European countries. In the United States, which they reached in the early 1860s, there are at least seven separate groups..
