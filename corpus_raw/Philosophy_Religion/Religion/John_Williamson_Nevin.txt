John Williamson Nevin,  (born February 20, 1803, Strasburg, Pennsylvania, U.S.—died June 6, 1886, Lancaster, Pennsylvania), American Protestant theologian and educator who contributed to the “Mercersburg theology”—a movement that attempted to counter the popular Protestant revivalism of antebellum America.
After graduating from the Princeton Theological Seminary in 1826, Nevin taught there and at the Western Theological Seminary before teaching at the Mercersburg Seminary (Pennsylvania), a German Reformed institution (1840–53). He also headed Marshall College (1841–53), teaching at Franklin and Marshall College after its merger in 1853 and serving as president from 1866 to 1876.
In 1843 Nevin published The Anxious Bench, an influential criticism of the revivalism and disregard for confessional traditions of such evangelists as Charles Grandison Finney. Nevin argued for the importance of church life and the sacramental side of Christianity, particularly for the importance of the Roman Catholic doctrines of Baptism and the Eucharist. These ideas, expressed in the Mercersburg Review, which he cofounded and edited from 1849 to 1853, were the foundation of the Mercersburg theology, a philosophy also influenced by F.A. Rauch (1806–41) and Philip Schaff (1819–93).
Nevin’s other major writings include Biblical Antiquities, 2 vol. (1827); The Mystical Presence (1846); and History and Genius of the Heidelberg Catechism (1847).
