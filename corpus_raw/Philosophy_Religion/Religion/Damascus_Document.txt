Damascus Document, in full The Document Of The New Covenant In The Land Of Damascus, also called Zadokite Fragments,  one of the most important extant works of the ancient Essene community of Jews at Qumrān in Palestine. The Essenes fled to the Judaean desert wilderness around Qumrān during Antiochus IV Epiphanes’ persecution of Palestinian Jews from 175 to 164/163 bc. Though a precise date for the composition of the Damascus Document has not been determined, it must have been written before the great Jewish revolt of 66–70 ad, which forced the Qumrān community to disband. See also Dead Sea Scrolls. 
Two medieval manuscripts dating from the 10th and 12th centuries were discovered in 1896–97 in the geniza (storeroom) of the Ezra synagogue in Cairo. They were published under the title Fragments of a Zadokite Work because members of the Essene community also called themselves Sons of Zadok (the Righteous One). The subsequent discovery of extensive Hebrew fragments from caves IV and VI at Qumrān confirmed that the document was indeed one of the major doctrinal and administrative codes of the Essene sect.
The Damascus Document consists of two major sections. The “exhortation” sets forth the sect’s religious teaching, emphasizing fidelity to God’s covenant with Israel and strict observance of the sabbath and other holy days. It also introduces the sect’s enigmatic leader, the Teacher of Righteousness, whom scholars have not been able to identify. Opposed by the Wicked Priest (possibly either of two high priests of the Hasmonean dynasty in Jerusalem: Jonathan, 152–143/142 bc, or Alexander Jannaeus, 103–76 bc), he was persecuted and exiled. The sect believed that a messianic age would commence 40 years after the death of the Teacher. The second section contains a list of statutes dealing with vows and ritual purity, guidelines for community assemblies, the selection of judges, and the duties of the Guardian, who controlled the admission and instruction of new members.
