Friar,  (from Latin frater through French frère, “brother”), man belonging to any of the Roman Catholic religious orders of mendicants, having taken a vow of poverty. Formerly, friar was the title given to individual members of these orders, such as Friar Laurence (in Romeo and Juliet), but this is no longer common. The 10 mendicant orders are the Dominicans, Franciscans, Augustinians (Augustian Hermits), Carmelites, Trinitarians, Mercedarians, Servites, Minims, Hospitallers of St. John of God, and Teutonic Order (the Austrian branch).
