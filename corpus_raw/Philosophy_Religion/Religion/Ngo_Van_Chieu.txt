Ngo Van Chieu, also called Ngo Minh Chieu,  (born 1878, Binh Tay, Vietnam—died  1926?, Tay Ninh), founder of the Vietnamese religious sect Cao Dai (q.v.).
Ngo Van Chieu graduated from a provincial college in My Tho and entered the French colonial immigration service, where he served until 1902. In 1919, during a séance, he received what he conceived to be a revelation calling him to a religious mission. After a period of study and meditation, he announced the formation of Cao Dai (literally meaning “High Tower,” a Taoist epithet for the supreme deity). Cao Dai was formally established in 1926 by Le Van Trung, a former government official, who became its leader, or “pope.” Cao Dai contains elements of Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, and Roman Catholicism.
