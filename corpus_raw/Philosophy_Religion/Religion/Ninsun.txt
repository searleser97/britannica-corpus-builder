Ninsun,  in Mesopotamian religion, Sumerian deity, city goddess of Kullab in the southern herding region. As Ninsun’s name, Lady Wild Cow, indicates, she was originally represented in bovine form and was considered the divine power behind, as well as the embodiment of, all the qualities the herdsman wished for in his cows: she was the “flawless cow” and a “mother of good offspring that loves the offspring.” She was, however, also represented in human form and could give birth to human offspring. The Wild Bull Dumuzi (as distinct from Dumuzi the Shepherd) was traditionally her son, whom she lamented in the yearly ritual marking his death. In her role as a mother figure, her other Sumerian counterparts include Ninhursag (Akkadian: Belit-ili) and Ninlil (Belit). Ninsun’s husband was the legendary hero Lugalbanda. See also Tammuz.
