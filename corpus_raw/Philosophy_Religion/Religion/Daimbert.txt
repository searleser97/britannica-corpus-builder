Daimbert, also called Dagobert, Italian Daiberto,  (died June 14, 1107, Messina, Norman principality of Sicily [now in Italy]), first archbishop of Pisa, Italy, who, as patriarch of Jerusalem, played a major role in the First Crusade.
Named bishop in 1088 and elevated to archbishop when Pisa was made an archdiocese in 1092, Daimbert accompanied Pope Urban II to France in 1095 to preach the First Crusade. Returning to Pisa the following year, he raised a Crusading fleet that sailed for the Holy Land in 1098. In 1100 he arrived in Jerusalem at the head of his own expedition. Asserting that the patriarch of Jerusalem, Arnulf of Chocques, had been illegally elected, Daimbert had him deposed and took his place, subsequently investing Godfrey of Bouillon, protector of the Holy Sepulchre, and Bohemond I, prince of Antioch, as his vassals.
When Godfrey died in July 1100, Jerusalem passed completely into Daimbert’s hands, but Godfrey’s brother Baldwin I, at that time count of Edessa (northeast of Jerusalem), marched on the Holy City and forced Daimbert to crown him king. Daimbert was gradually eased from his position of authority and finally driven from Jerusalem in 1102, Baldwin stripping him of his title and confiscating his treasure. Back in Italy, Daimbert appealed to Pope Paschal II, who supported his claims. Sailing again for Syria, Daimbert reached Messina (in Sicily), where he died.
