Liturgy of St. James,  a eucharistic service based on the Antiochene Liturgy, said to be the most ancient Christian liturgy. Modified forms of the Liturgy of St. James are used by Catholic Syrians, Miaphysite Syrians (Jacobites), Maronites, and the Orthodox of Zakynthos and Jerusalem. In most Eastern churches, Orthodox and Catholic, it has been superseded by the Byzantine liturgy of St. John Chrysostom.
The Liturgy of St. James has the following order of service: (1) readings from Scriptures, including the Old Testament, Epistles, Acts, and Gospels; (2) a sermon from the bishop; (3) a dismissal of the catechumens; (4) a prayer for the faithful; (5) the kiss of peace and words of greeting from the bishop; (6) the washing of hands; (7) the offering of gifts; (8) the Eucharist, including prayer, preface, Sanctus, words of institution, anamnesis (remembrance of the dead), epiclesis (invocation of the Holy Spirit), intercessory prayers for the church, for the living, and for the dead, preparatory prayers for communion, celebration of communion, and prayer of thanksgiving; and (9) the final blessings from the bishop.
