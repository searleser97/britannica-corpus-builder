Felix,  (died 818), bishop of Urgel, Spain, one of the chief proponents of Adoptionism (q.v.).
When Archbishop Elipandus of Toledo promulgated the Adoptionist doctrine, he was condemned by Pope Adrian I. Elipandus then sought the support of Felix, who expressed agreement, whereupon Charlemagne in 792 summoned Felix to the Council of Ratisbon (Regensburg, Bavaria [Germany]), where Felix was induced to recant.
Although the Spanish church sent an open letter supporting the essential orthodoxy of Felix and Elipandus, the condemnation was renewed at a council summoned to Frankfurt am Main in 794. Felix, who had been transferred to Rome, returned to Urgel and engaged in a bitter doctrinal duel with Alcuin of York, who in 781 had become a member of Charlemagne’s court at Aachen.
In 798 a new pope, Leo III, held a Roman council that condemned Felix’ Adoptionism and anathematized him. A commission under Archbishop Leidrad of Lyon brought Felix to the Council of Aachen in 799, and there, after six days of dispute with Alcuin, he recanted again. Since his orthodoxy was still considered suspect, he was placed under Leidrad’s surveillance but remained unrepentant and continued to administer his see undisturbed.
