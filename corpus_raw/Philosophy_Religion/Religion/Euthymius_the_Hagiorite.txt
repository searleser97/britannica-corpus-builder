Euthymius The Hagiorite, Georgian Ekvthime Mthatzmideli (Euthymius of the Holy Mountain),  (born c. 955, Georgia, Transcaucasia—died  May 13, 1028, Mt. Athos, Greece), monastic leader, scholar, and writer whose propagation of Greek culture and Eastern Orthodox tradition generated the golden age of Georgian education and literature.
The son of a Georgian noble and court official, Euthymius accompanied his father into monastic retirement, first on Mt. Olympus, then on Mt. Athos. At the Georgian monastery of Ivíron on Athos, Euthymius became abbot in 998, in succession to his father. By 1012 he was working exclusively with the translation and revision of biblical and liturgical texts for the use of the Georgian people in their church libraries. Ivíron, with its academy, thus became a centre of Byzantine culture and a school for future leaders of the Georgian church and state. Before the 10th century the Georgian Bible had existed in a variety of disparate versions. Under Euthymius’ direction the monks of Ivíron translated the Scriptures from Hebrew, Greek, and Syriac sources into a definitive Georgian text that is still in use. His translation, moreover, of the Greek Byzantine liturgy of St. Basil and St. Chrysostom gradually displaced the former Georgian usage of Jerusalem’s liturgy of St. James. In addition to some hagiographical work, Euthymius also produced a Georgian text of most of the 4th-century works of St. Gregory of Nazianzus, usually considered the foremost theologian in the history of Greek Christianity. His work earned him the reputation of a doctor of the church and the sobriquet “the Georgian Chrysostom,” a reference to the 4th-century scholar-patriarch of Constantinople.
