Leo Jud,  (born 1482, Germar, Alsace [now in France]—died June 19, 1542, Zürich, Switzerland), Swiss religious Reformer, biblical scholar, and translator and an associate of Huldrych Zwingli and Heinrich Bullinger in the Zürich Reformation. He collaborated in drafting the first Helvetic Confession (an important Reformation creed; 1536).
After studying medicine at the University of Basel, Jud turned to theology and held several pastorates in Alsace and Zürich. In 1523 he married a former nun. Much of his literary career was devoted to the support of the theological polemics of his close friend Zwingli. Jud believed in the mutual independence of church and state: the state should not hinder the church in its task of saving and disciplining, nor should there be any compulsion in matters of faith. He made many translations, including a translation of the Bible into German (the Zürich Bible) and of the Old Testament into Latin.
