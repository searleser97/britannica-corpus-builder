Ah Kin,   (Mayan: “He of the Sun”), the regular clergy of the Yucatec Maya in pre-Columbian times. The Ah Kin are best known historically for their performance in the ritual sacrifice of victims, whose hearts were offered to the Mayan gods. The chief priest (Ah Kin Mai) served in the various capacities of administrator, teacher, healer, astronomer, adviser to the chief, and diviner. Priests specializing in prophecy were known as Chilans, but it is likely that Ah Kins and Chilans performed many of the same functions. Prophecy was aided by readings from hieroglyphic books and, possibly, by drug-induced visions. Couples contemplating marriage as well as civic leaders consulted the Ah Kin on the prospects of their undertakings. The office of Ah Kin was hereditary, passing from priests to their sons, but training was also extended to the sons of the nobility who showed inclinations toward the priesthood.
