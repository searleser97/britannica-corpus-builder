National Baptist Convention of the United States of America, Inc., also called National Baptist Convention, U.S.A., Inc.,  the larger of two associations of Black Baptist churches that formed after a schism in 1915 in the National Baptist Convention. It is the largest Black church in the United States and claimed a membership of about 8,500,000 in 30,000 congregations in the late 20th century.
The National Baptist Convention had its origins in the period after the American Civil War, when many independent Black Baptist congregations were established. Eventually they joined in various national organizations, and the merger of the Foreign Mission Baptist Convention (1880), the American National Baptist Convention (1886), and the Baptist National Educational Convention (1893) in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1895 produced the National Baptist Convention. Disagreements over the organizationâ€™s publishing house and adoption of a charter resulted in a schism in 1915, when one group adopted the charter and took the name National Baptist Convention of the United States of America, Inc., and the other group rejected the charter and continued as the National Baptist Convention of America. The latter denomination had about 3,500,000 members by the late 20th century. In 1961 a dispute within the National Baptist Convention, U.S.A., Inc., resulted in the establishment of a third organization, the Progressive National Baptist Convention, Inc., with about 2,500,000 members.
