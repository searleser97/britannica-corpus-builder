Mor Ignatius Yacoub III,  (born 1912, Bartella, Iraq—died June 26, 1980, Damascus, Syria), Syriac Orthodox patriarch of Antioch who combined scholarship and dedication with an active commitment to the ecumenical movement.
Mor Ignatius Yacoub III studied in the seminary of Mar Mattai, took his monastic vows in Homs, Syria, and went to India as secretary to the patriarchal legate and later, after his ordination as deacon and priest, as dean of the theological faculty in Malabar. In 1950 he became bishop of the diocese of Beirut and Damascus, and in 1957 he was elected patriarch of Antioch and All the East, thus becoming the leader of the Syriac Orthodox Church. He reunited the divided Indian church and founded two new dioceses in western Europe. A noted writer and scholar, Yacoub was also a spokesman for the Arab cause, protesting strongly against the Israeli occupation of Jerusalem and expressing regret at the tragedy of the Lebanese Civil War (1975–90). In 1979 he visited Britain to meet the archbishop of Canterbury, and in 1980 he went to Rome for discussions with Pope John Paul II.
