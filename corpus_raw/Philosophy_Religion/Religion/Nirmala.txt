Nirmala,   an ascetic order of the Sikhs, a religious group of India. Nirmalas (“those without blemish”) at first wore only white garments but later adopted the ochre robes worn by Hindu ascetics and shared some other practices, such as birth and death rites, with Hindus. Like the Udāsī order of Sikh ascetics the Nirmalas carried on missionary activities for the Sikhs and served as mahants (priests) of their temples.
