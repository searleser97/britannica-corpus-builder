Mēness, (Latvian), Lithuanian Mėnuo,  in Baltic religion, the moon, the god whose monthly renewal of strength is imparted to all growing things. The “young,” or “new,” moon, sometimes called Dievaitis (Lithuanian: “Little God,” or “Prince”), is especially receptive to human prayers and is honoured by farmers.
Mēness, dressed in a starry gown and riding in a chariot drawn by gray horses, displays traits of a war god but is known chiefly as the main suitor of Saule, the sun goddess, or as one of the rivals for the hand of Saule’s daughter. In some traditions Mēness marries Saule but is unfaithful to her; for his infidelity he is punished by Pērkons, the Thunderer.
