St. Hilary, Latin Hilarius,  (born, Sardinia, Italy—died February 29, 468; feast day February 28), pope from 461 to 468.
In 449 Emperor Theodosius II convened a council in Ephesus to uphold the monophysite Eutyches in his clash against St. Flavian, who, as patriarch of Constantinople, defended the doctrine of two natures in Christ. As Pope Leo I’s legate to this so-called “robber synod,” St. Hilary opposed the deposition of St. Flavian and condemned the Eutychianism heresy that held that the human aspect of Christ’s nature was subsumed by his divinity. After supporting Flavian, Hilary fled to Rome, where he was elected Leo’s successor as pope in 461. His letters show him as a wise and zealous administrator, correcting abuses and solving disputes submitted from southern Gaul and Spain. His synod of 465 is the oldest Roman synod of which the acts survive.
