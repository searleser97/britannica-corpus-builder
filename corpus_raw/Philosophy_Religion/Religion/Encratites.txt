Encratite,   member of an ascetic Christian sect led by Tatian, a 2nd-century Syrian rhetorician. The name derived from the group’s doctrine of continence (Greek: enkrateia). The sect shunned marriage, the eating of flesh, and the drinking of intoxicating beverages, even substituting water or milk for wine in the Eucharist.
Tatian converted to Christianity while studying in Rome under the Christian apologist Justin Martyr. He early showed his ascetic bent, and, after Justin’s martyrdom (c. ad 165), Tatian drifted further toward dualism and Gnosticism, severed his ties with the church, and returned to Syria, where his association with the Encratites began. He formulated the doctrine that denied salvation to Adam, and he reinterpreted some of the Pauline texts of the New Testament (e.g., 1 Corinthians 7:3–6) to make them concur with the Encratite view that marriage was licentious and a service of the devil. Eusebius of Caesarea stated in his 4th-century history of the church that the Encratites actually rejected both the Pauline Letters and The Acts of the Apostles.
