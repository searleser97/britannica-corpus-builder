Grihya-sutra,  in Hinduism, any of a number of manuals detailing the domestic (grihya) religious ceremonies performed by both male and female householders over the fire. The Grihya-sutras, together with the Shrauta-sutras (which deal with the grand Vedic sacrifices) and the Dharma-sutras (which deal with rules of conduct), make up the Kalpa-sutras—collections of texts that emerged within the different Vedic schools. The Grihya-sutras describe the ceremonies (samskaras) that mark each stage of an individual’s life, from the moment of conception to the final death rites; the five daily sacrifices (mahayajna); seasonal ceremonies; and those observed on special occasions, such as house building or cattle breeding.
