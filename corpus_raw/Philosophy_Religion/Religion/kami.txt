Kami, plural kami,  object of worship in Shintō and other indigenous religions of Japan. The term kami is often translated as “god,” “lord,” or “deity,” but it also includes other forces of nature, both good and evil, which, because of their superiority or divinity, become objects of reverence and respect. The sun goddess Amaterasu Ōmikami and other creator spirits, illustrious ancestors, and both animate and inanimate things, such as plants, rocks, birds, beasts, and fish, may all be treated as kami. In early Shintō the heavenly kami (amatsukami) were considered nobler than the earthly kami (kunitsukami), but in modern Shintō this distinction is no longer made. Kami are manifested in, or take residence in, symbolic objects such as a mirror (see shintai), in which form they are usually worshipped in Shintō shrines. Shintō myths speak of the “800 myriads of kami” to express the infinite number of potential kami, and new ones continue to be recognized.
