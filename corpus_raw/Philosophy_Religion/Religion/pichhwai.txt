Pichhwai,  cloth hanging used as a backdrop for images worshipped in temples of the Hindu Vallabhacharya sect, who are devotees of the god Krishna. Pichhwais, which form a part of the temple decor, are changed frequently according to the day, the season, and the occasion. Some are fairly large and are made from such costly fabrics as velvet and brocade, while others are smaller and are made of cotton cloth decorated with embroidery or painting. In the 18th century the decoration consisted mainly of landscapes with small animal and human figures. Later, large human figures began to predominate.
Among the main themes are episodes from the life of Krishna, such as the lifting of Mount Govardhana, the stealing of the clothes of the bathing milkmaids, and the circle dance in the moonlight. Representations of rituals and festivals are also found. Although pichhwais were painted at several centres in Rajasthan, Gujarat, and the Deccan, the main centre of manufacture has been Nathdwara, near Udaipur in Rajasthan.
