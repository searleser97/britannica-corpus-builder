Camaldolese, member of Congregation of Monk Hermits of Camaldoli,  an independent offshoot of the Benedictine order, founded about 1012 at Camaldoli near Arezzo, Italy, by St. Romuald as part of the monastic-reform movement of the 11th and 12th centuries. The order combined the solitary life of the hermit with an austere form of the common life of the monk. The monastery and the hermitage formed one unit. Beginners resided in the monastery; the proficient and more perfect, in the judgment of the abbot or prior, lived in the hermitage. This ideal union of monastery and hermitage was not always followed, and independent foundations of both types were made; the two branches were reunited in 1935. A reform group, the Congregation of Monte Corona, was founded in 1523 and still exists in reduced numbers.
