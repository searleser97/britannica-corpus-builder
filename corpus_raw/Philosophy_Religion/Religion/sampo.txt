Sampo,   mysterious object often referred to in the mythological songs of the Finns, most likely a cosmological pillar or some similar support holding up the vault of heaven. In a cycle of songs, referred to by scholars as the sampo-epic, the sampo is forged by the creator-smith Ilmarinen for Louhi, the hag-goddess of the underworld, and is then stolen back by Ilmarinen and the shaman-hero Väinämöinen. They are pursued by Louhi, and in the ensuing battle sampo is smashed into little pieces, which still preserve enough potency to provide for “sowing and reaping” and other forms of prosperity.
The comments of early informants reveal that the songs were part of a ritual cycle sung at a spring sowing ceremony to further the growth of grain. The conclusions of scholars such as E.N. Setälä, Uno Harva, and, more recently, Martti Haavio are more or less in agreement that sampo refers to the support holding up the firmament, a concept found in many early cosmologies. The name sampo may even be a cognate of words such as Sanskrit skambha, “pillar,” and Altaic sumbur, the “world mountain.” As the mythical axis mundi, around which the heavens revolve, all life is dependent on the sampo, which the Finnish songs depict as the source of all good.
