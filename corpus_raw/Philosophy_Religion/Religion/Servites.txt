Servite, member of Order of the Servants of Mary (O.S.M.),  a Roman Catholic order of mendicant friars—religious men who lead a monastic life, including the choral recitation of the liturgical office, but do active work—founded in 1233 by a group of seven cloth merchants of Florence. These men, known collectively as the Seven Holy Founders, left their families and occupations to withdraw outside the gates of Florence and live a life of poverty, penance, and fellowship. In 1241 a part of the group departed for Monte Senario, about 19 km (12 miles) from the city, where they continued their penitential life but lived in greater solitude as hermits. Gradually there developed a desire within these two communities for official recognition, and in 1256 the order was approved by Pope Alexander IV.
The Servites’ apostolic work consists primarily in preaching, administering parishes, giving missions, and in fostering devotion to Mary, especially under the title of Our Lady of Sorrows. The Servite family also includes sisters, traditionally known as Mantellate Sisters, engaged in many active works, and nuns devoted entirely to prayer within the monastery.
