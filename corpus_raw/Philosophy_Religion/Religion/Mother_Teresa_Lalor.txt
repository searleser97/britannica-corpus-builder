Mother Teresa Lalor, original name Alice Lalor,  (born c. 1766, Ireland—died Sept. 9, 1846, Washington, D.C., U.S.), Irish-born American religious leader who helped found and became superior of the first order of Visitation nuns in the United States.
Alice Lalor grew up in Kilkenny, Ireland. She was deeply religious from early childhood. Only the intervention of her parents, who persuaded her instead to accompany an older sister to America, prevented her from joining in the establishment of a community of Presentation nuns in Kilkenny.
By the time of her arrival in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in January 1795, she had formed close friendships with two fellow passengers, both widows, with whom she soon established an informal religious community under the guidance of Father Leonard Neale. They engaged in various types of charitable work and greatly assisted Father Neale during the yellow fever epidemic of 1797–98.
In 1798 Father Neale became president of Georgetown College (now University), and the next year Lalor and her companions followed him to Washington, D.C. A short time later they opened a school, and in 1804 they bought a convent abandoned by a group of Poor Clare nuns. Neale recommended that the small community become part of the Visitation order. Accordingly, in December 1816, they were recognized by Pope Pius VII as the first American foundation of the Visitation nuns, and Lalor became first superior as Mother Teresa. She resigned as superior in 1819 and lived out her life in the Georgetown convent in Washington.
