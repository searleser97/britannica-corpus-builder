Shinshoku,   priest in the Shintō religion of Japan. The main function of the shinshoku is to officiate at all shrine ceremonies on behalf of and at the request of worshippers. He is not expected to lecture, preach, or act as spiritual leader to his parishioners; rather, his main role is to ensure the continuance of a satisfactory relationship between the kami (god or sacred power) and the worshipper through offerings, evocation of the kami, and mediation of the deity’s blessing to the parishioners.
The highest rank of shinshoku is the gūji (chief priest). In large shrines he generally has serving under him the gon-gūji (associate chief priest), negi (priest, or senior priest), and gon-negi ( junior priest).
In the Grand Shrine of Ise, the supreme priestess, the saishu (“chief of the religious ceremonies”), ranks even above the supreme priest, the dai-gūji. Formerly the post of supreme priestess was always filled by an unmarried princess of the Imperial family. She devoted herself entirely to the religious ceremonies (matsuri, q.v.) of the Ise Shrine.
To qualify as a shinshoku, a novice must attend a school approved by the Jinja Honchō (Association of Shintō Shrines), usually the Kokugakuin University in Tokyo, or pass a qualifying examination. At one time the office of high priest was inherited. The priesthood of some temples is said to have remained within the same families for as many as 100 generations. Although the hereditary status of the office has been abolished, the practice continues in many shrines by local preference.
Priests may marry and have families. Women may also be admitted to the priesthood, and widows often succeed their husbands. The priests are supported by offerings of the parishioners and worshippers.
In modern Japan an alternative name for the Shintō priest is kannushi, which traditionally referred only to a head priest who, through the observance of purificatory practices, had become qualified to serve as a medium for a deity.
