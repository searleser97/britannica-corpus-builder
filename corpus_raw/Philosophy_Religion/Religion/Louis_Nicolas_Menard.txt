Louis-Nicolas Ménard,  (born Oct. 19, 1822, Paris, Fr.—died  Feb. 9, 1901, Paris), French writer whose vision of ancient Greek religion and philosophy influenced the Parnassian poets.
Educated at the Collège Louis-le-Grand and the École Normale, Ménard was a gifted chemist (an early investigator of collodion) as well as a painter and historian. He was a socialist republican and was condemned to prison in 1849 for his Prologue d’une révolution, which contained radical political opinions and his reminiscences of the June 1848 insurrections in Paris, in which he played an active part. He escaped abroad, returning to Paris in 1852. Thereafter he devoted himself to classical studies. He spent several years painting in Barbizon and exhibited in the Salons (1857–69). In 1871 he supported and defended the Commune and in 1876 published Rêveries d’un païen mystique (“Reveries of a Mystic Pagan”), which expounds his philosophy. He later held academic chairs in decorative art and universal history.
Ménard’s poetic works pale beside those of Leconte de Lisle and José María de Heredia, both of whom he influenced considerably. His short novel La Légende de Saint-Hilarion (1875) inspired Anatole France’s novel Thaïs (1890), and his long poem Prométhée délivré (1843) was a model for Flaubert’s story La Tentation de Saint Antoine (1874). His importance can best be seen in his historical and critical works.
