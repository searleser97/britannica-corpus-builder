Talbīyah,   in Islām, the formulaic pronouncement labbaykah allāhummah labbaykah (“at your service, O Lord, at your service”), recited especially during a pilgrimage when pious Muslims perform the ṭawāf—i.e., walk around the sacred shrine of the Kaʿbah. The question whether the talbīyah is obligatory or merely a commendable tradition has been much discussed, but Muslim theologians have reached no consensus. All Muslim sects and theological schools within Islām thus continue to use the talbīyah during pilgrimages and on other religious occasions. There are several longer versions of talbīyah that have been attributed to certain prominent Muslims, particularly to Muḥammad and the Companions, and even to such pious figures from the past as Adam and Noah.
