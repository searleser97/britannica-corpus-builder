Saint Paulinus,  (born 584?, Rome [Italy]—died  644, Rochester, Kent, Eng.; feast day October 10), Italian missionary who converted Northumbria to Christianity, became the first bishop of York, and was later made archbishop of Rochester.
In 601 Paulinus was sent with St. Mellitus (later first bishop of London) and St. Justus (later first bishop of Rochester) to England by Pope St. Gregory I the Great to assist Archbishop St. Augustine of Canterbury in his mission of converting England to Christianity. Paulinus was consecrated bishop at Kent (625) by Justus (then fourth archbishop of Canterbury) and escorted the daughter of King Aethelberht (Ethelbert) of Kent to the Northumbrian king Edwin. Paulinus converted and baptized Edwin (627), who made him first bishop of York, after which Paulinus’ missions spread throughout Northumbria. When in 632 Edwin was slain by the Anglo-Saxon kings Caedwalla and Penda, Paulinus fled to Kent, where he became bishop of Rochester. He became archbishop in 634, when he received the pallium (i.e., symbol of metropolitan jurisdiction) from Pope Honorius I.
