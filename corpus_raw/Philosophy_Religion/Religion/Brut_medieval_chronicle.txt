Brut,  any of several medieval chronicles of Britain tracing the history and legend of the country from the time of the mythical Brutus, descendant of Aeneas and founder of Britain. The Roman de Brut (1155) by the Anglo-Norman author Wace was one such chronicle. Perhaps the outstanding adaptation of the story is Layamonâ€™s Brut (c. 1200), written in Middle English; it lent a distinctly Germanic and heroic flavour to the story and signaled the revival of English literature after the Norman Conquest of 1066.
