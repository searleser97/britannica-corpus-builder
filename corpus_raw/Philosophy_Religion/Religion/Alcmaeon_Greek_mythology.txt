Alcmaeon, also spelled Alcmeon,  in Greek legend, the son of the seer Amphiaraus and his wife Eriphyle. When Amphiaraus set out with the expedition of the Seven Against Thebes, which he knew would be fatal to him, he commanded his sons to avenge his death by slaying Eriphyle (who had been bribed by Polyneices with the necklace of Harmonia to persuade her husband to fight) and by undertaking a second expedition against Thebes. After leading the Epigoni (the sons of the Seven) in the destruction of Thebes, Alcmaeon carried out his father’s injunctions by killing his mother, but as a punishment he was driven mad and pursued by the Erinyes (goddesses of vengeance) from place to place.
On his arrival at Psophis in Arcadia, he was purified by its king, Phegeus, whose daughter Arsinoë (or Alphesiboea) he married, making her a present of the fatal necklace and the robe of Harmonia, which brought misfortune to all who possessed them. The land was cursed with barrenness, and an oracle declared that Alcmaeon would not find rest until he reached a spot on which the sun had never shone at the time he slew his mother. Such a spot he found at the mouth of the Achelous River, where an island had recently been formed. There he settled and, forgetting his wife, married Callirrhoë, the daughter of the river god. Callirrhoë coveted the necklace, and Alcmaeon, having returned to get it from his wife, was killed by Arsinoë’s brothers (Phegeus’s sons). On Alcmaeon’s death, Callirrhoë prayed that her two young sons might grow to manhood at once and avenge their father. Her prayer was granted, and her sons, Amphoterus and Acarnan, slew Phegeus. After his death Alcmaeon was worshiped at Thebes; his tomb was at Psophis. His story was the subject of the modern parody “A Fragment of a Greek Tragedy,” by A.E. Housman.
