St. Bridget of Sweden, Bridget also spelled Birgit or Brigid, Swedish Sankta Birgitta av Sverige,  (born c. 1303, Sweden—died July 23, 1373, Rome [Italy]; canonized October 8, 1391; feast day July 23, formerly October 8), patron saint of Sweden, founder of the Bridgittines (Order of the Most Holy Savior), and a mystic whose revelations were influential during the Middle Ages. In 1999 Pope John Paul II named her one of the patron saints of Europe.
The daughter of Birger Persson, governor of Uppland, she had from an early age remarkable religious visions that influenced her entire life and outlook. As a young teenager in 1316 she married Ulf Gudmarsson, later governor of the province of Nericia. She bore eight children, including St. Catherine of Sweden.
On the death of her husband in 1344, Bridget retired to a life of penance and prayer near the Cistercian monastery of Alvastra on Lake Vetter. To the prior, Peter Olafsson, she dictated the revelations that came to her, and he translated them into Latin. One was a command to found a new religious order, which she was not able to fulfill until near the end of her life, receiving papal permission from Pope Urban V for her order of cloistered nuns in 1370. She went to Rome in 1350 and, except for several pilgrimages, remained there for the rest of her life, constantly accompanied by Catherine. She exercised a wide apostolate among rich and poor, sheltering the homeless and sinners, and she worked untiringly for the end of the Avignon papacy and for the pope to return to Rome. She was spurred by a vision to visit the Holy Land in 1372, and she died soon after her return to Rome.
Bridget’s revelations were first published in 1492 and have since been published in many languages.
