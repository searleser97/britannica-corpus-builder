Himoragi, (Japanese: “offerings to the gods”)  in Japanese Shintō tradition, sacred areas or ritual precincts marked off by rocks, tree branches, and hemp ropes. This kind of special cordoned-off natural space serves as a temporary sanctuary for kami spirits and is the predecessor for all forms of Shintō shrines.
