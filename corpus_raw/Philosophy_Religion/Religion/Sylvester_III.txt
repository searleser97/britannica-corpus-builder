Sylvester III, also spelled Silvester, original name John of Sabina, Italian Giovanni di Sabina,  (born, Rome, Papal States [Italy]—died c. 1063), pope from January 20 to February 10, 1045.
He was bishop of Sabina when elected pope in January 1045 by a faction that had driven Pope Benedict IX out of Rome. The following month, however, Benedict’s supporters in turn expelled Sylvester. Mired in scandal, Benedict felt so uncertain about his position in Rome that he resigned the papacy in favour of his godfather, the archpriest John Gratian, a figure of high moral standing. The new pope, Gregory VI, was consecrated in May 1045. After receiving a payment from either Gregory or his supporters, Sylvester recognized Gregory and returned to his old bishopric.
When Benedict afterward attempted to reclaim the papacy and depose Gregory, the Holy Roman emperor Henry III directed Gregory to convoke the Synod of Sutri (December 1046), which deposed both Sylvester—who had attempted to reclaim the papacy against Benedict’s apparent unsuitability—and Gregory. At a Roman synod three days later, Benedict was declared deposed, and Pope Clement II (1046–47) was elected and consecrated. The sentence of Sylvester’s deposition survives in the documents issued by him as bishop of Sabina during 1046. The legitimacy of his election is disputed, and he is regarded by some as an antipope.
