Malāmatīyah,   a Ṣūfī (Muslim mystic) group that flourished in Sāmānid Iran during the 8th century. The name Malāmatīyah was derived from the Arabic verb laʾma (“to be ignoble,” or “to be wicked”). Malāmatī doctrines were based on the reproach of the carnal self and a careful watch over its inclinations to surrender to the temptations of the world. They often referred to the Qurʾānic verse “I [God] swear by the reproachful soul” as the basis for their philosophy. This verse, they said, clearly praised a self that constantly reproached and blamed its owner for the slightest deviation from the world of God. The reproachful self in Malāmatī terminology was the perfect self.
The Malāmatīyah found value in self-blame, believing that it would be conducive to a true detachment from worldly things and to disinterested service of God. They feared the praise and respect of other persons. Piety, the Malāmatī believer said, is a private affair between man and God. A Malāmatī believer further concealed his knowledge as a precaution against acquiring fame and strove to make his faults known, so that he would always be reminded of his imperfection. Toward others they were as tolerant and forgiving as they were strict and harsh on themselves.
While other Ṣūfīs revealed their aḥwāl (states of ecstasy) and their joy over progressing from one maqām (spiritual stage) to the next, the Malāmatīyah kept their achievements and their feelings concealed. Ṣūfīs wore particular clothes, organized various orders, and assumed all sorts of titles; the Malāmatīyah were steadfast in concealing their identities and belittling their achievements. In fact, Malāmatī doctrines were so different from those of most Ṣūfī groups that a few scholars did not consider the Malāmatīyah to be Ṣūfīs.
