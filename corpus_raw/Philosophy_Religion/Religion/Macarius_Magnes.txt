Macarius Magnes,  (flourished  5th century), Eastern Orthodox bishop and polemicist, author of an apology for the Christian faith, a document of signal value for its verbatim preservation of early philosophical attacks on Christian revelation.
Of Macarius’ origin and career, nothing is known except that he is probably identified with the bishop of Magnesia, later Manisa, Tur., who, at the Synod of the Oak in 403, contended with an episcopal friend of the eminent 4th-century reform patriarch of Constantinople, John Chrysostom. His importance, however, stems from his theological defense of Christianity by the obscurely titled Apokritikos ē monogenēs pros Hellēnas, 5 books (c. 400; “Response of the Only-Begotten to the Greeks”), commonly called the Apocriticus. Its doctrine is basically derived from the Cappadocian school, one of the foremost cultural centres of the early Greek Church. Ironically, its chief claim to historical notice is its accurate presentation of the pagan viewpoint.
Through the literary device of an imaginary five-day dispute in dialogue form with an unbelieving critic, the Apocriticus precisely reproduces the best known forms of anti-Christian propaganda contemporary with the author. The pagan criticism, according to scholarly consensus, derived from the learned 15-book argument Against the Christians by the 3rd-century Greek philosopher Porphyry; the loss of this work renders the Apocriticus of even greater value.
The critic questions biblical texts, particularly concerning Christ’s Incarnation and Resurrection. The 16th-century Jesuit F. Torres (Latin Turrianus) adduced the work in his theological controversy with the Lutherans on the sacrament of Christ’s body. About half of the Apocriticus text has survived through the edition of C. Blondel (1876). An English version was produced by T.W. Crafer in 1919.
