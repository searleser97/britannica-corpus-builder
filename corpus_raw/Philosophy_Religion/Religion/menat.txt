Menat,  in Egyptian religion, a necklace composed of many rows of beads and an amulet, usually hung at the back of the neck as a counterpoise. The amulet, frequently made of glazed ware and often found buried with the dead, was a symbol of divine protection. Among women it was believed to foster fruitfulness and health, while for men it signified virility.
