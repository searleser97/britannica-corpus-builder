St. Bénézet, Latin Benedictus,  (born c. 1165—died c. 1184, Avignon, France; feast day April 14), builder who instigated and directed the building of the Pont d’Avignon, also known as the Pont Saint-Bénézet, over the Rhône River at Avignon, France. He is the patron saint of bridge builders.
An uneducated shepherd, Bénézet claimed that he was divinely commanded in a vision to build the bridge at a point where the force of the Rhône was so great that it had discouraged even Roman engineers in antiquity. The bishop of Avignon, at first skeptical, finally approved the project, and work began in 1177. Bénézet reputedly overcame many obstacles miraculously, and construction of the bridge was said to have caused 18 miraculous healings. Convinced that the work was ordained by God, wealthy patrons formed the first “Bridge-Building Brotherhood” to fund Bénézet’s endeavour. He died four years before the bridge was completed and was buried in a chapel built on one of the piers. After almost 500 years his body was removed, and his relics are at Saint-Didier in Avignon.
