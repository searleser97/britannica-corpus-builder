Yama-no-kami,   in Japanese popular religion, any of numerous gods of the mountains. These kami are of two kinds: (1) gods who rule over mountains and are venerated by hunters, woodcutters, and charcoal burners and (2) gods who rule over agriculture and are venerated by farmers. Chief among them is Ō-yama-tsumi-no-mikoto, born from the fire god who was cut into pieces by his angry father Izanagi (see Ho-musubi). Another prominent mountain deity is Ko-no-hana-saku-ya-hime—wife of the divine grandchild Ninigi and mother of two mythological princes, Fireshade and Fireshine—who resides on Fuji-yama. A widespread tradition connected with the worship of Yama-no-kami is the offering of a salt-sea fish called okoze.
