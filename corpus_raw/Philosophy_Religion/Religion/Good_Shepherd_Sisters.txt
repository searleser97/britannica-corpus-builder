Good Shepherd Sister, member of The Religious of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd (R.G.S.), also called Sisters of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd,  a Roman Catholic order of religious devoted particularly to the care, rehabilitation, and education of girls and young women who have demonstrated delinquent behaviour. The congregation traces its history to an order founded by St. John Eudes in 1641 at Caen, Fr. This order, known as the Religious of Our Lady of Charity of the Refuge, was virtually destroyed during the French Revolution. The Refuge at Tours was trying to reestablish itself when Rose-Virginie Pelletier entered the community in 1814 and took the name Sister Mary Euphrasia. By 1829 she had become superior of the community and founded a convent at Angers, followed in the next five years by four more convents. In 1835 Pope Gregory XVI approved a unified administration for the convents under the title of Sisters of Our Lady of the Good Shepherd. The congregation spread rapidly; today, members live in convents throughout the world. They work with delinquent girls, problem children, persons who are serving sentences imposed by civil courts, and alcoholics; they also conduct hospitals and schools.
