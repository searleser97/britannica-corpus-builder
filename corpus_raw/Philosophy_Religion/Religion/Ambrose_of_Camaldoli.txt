Ambrose Of Camaldoli, Italian Ambrogio Camaldolese,  original name Ambrogio Traversari,  (born Sept. 16, 1386, Portico, Republic of Florence—died  Oct. 20, 1439, Florence), Humanist, ecclesiastic, and patristic translator who helped effect the brief reunion of the Eastern and Western churches in the 15th century. He entered the Camaldolese Order in 1400 at Florence, where, over a period of 30 years, he mastered Latin and particularly Greek, which enabled him to translate Greek patristic works into Latin, including those of SS. Athanasius the Great of Alexandria, Basil the Great of Caesarea, and John Chrysostom of Constantinople. His reputation in Humanist circles won him the patronage of Cosimo de’ Medici.
Pope Eugenius IV appointed him minister general of the Camaldolese Order in 1431 and papal emissary to the Council of Basel in 1435. He served a prime role at the Council of Ferrara–Florence when, in 1438, as papal representative, he received at the council the Byzantine emperor John VIII and Patriarch Joseph of Constantinople. His expertise in Greek and Eastern theology made him a chief negotiator for the decree of union between the Latin and Greek churches promulgated shortly before his death. Although never formally beatified, he is commemorated at Florence and by the Camaldolese on November 20.
