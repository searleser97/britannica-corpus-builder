Dēnkart, (Pahlavi: “Acts of the Religion”) also spelled Dinkard,  9th-century encyclopaedia of the Zoroastrian religious tradition. Of the original nine volumes, part of the third and all of volumes four through nine are extant. The surviving portion of the third book is a major source of Zoroastrian theology. It indicates that later Zoroastrianism had incorporated and reinterpreted elements of Aristotelian philosophy and vocabulary. Books four through six discuss metaphysics, doctrinal history, the history of mankind with emphasis on the Iranian peoples, and moral principles. The seventh book includes a biography of the prophet Zoroaster. The eighth and ninth are commentaries on the Avesta, the main Zoroastrian scripture, and the only source of information on its lost original form.
