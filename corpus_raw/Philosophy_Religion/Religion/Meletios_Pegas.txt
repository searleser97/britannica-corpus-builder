Meletios Pegas,  Meletios also spelled Meletius,  (born 1549, Candia [Iráklion], Crete—died  Sept. 14, 1601, Alexandria), Greek Orthodox patriarch of Alexandria who strove by theological arguments and ecclesiastical diplomacy to maintain the position and prestige of Greek Orthodoxy in the Middle East and Eastern Europe.
A monastic superior at Candia, Meletios studied at Padua and Venice, from which he was sent into exile. Soon after 1575 he entered the service of the patriarchal courts at Alexandria and Constantinople and in 1590 was consecrated patriarch of Alexandria. In the exercise of this office he participated in various Eastern Orthodox councils, notably at Constantinople in 1593 and 1597, dealing with the patriarchate of Moscow that had been established in 1589, to which Meletios gave reluctant support in 1592.
He was vigorously opposed to the negotiations between Ukrainian and Belorussian Orthodox, living in Polish Lithuania, and the Roman Catholic church, and to the Union of Brest-Litovsk (1596), by which they submitted to Rome. His writings include his correspondence with King Sigismund III of Poland, denying claims of papal supremacy and condemning the union; miscellaneous writings delineating his theology of the church; a polemic (1596) against the Latin church’s formulation of the Trinitarian relations between Father, Son, and Spirit; and an apology of the Christian religion, addressed to the Jews (1593).
