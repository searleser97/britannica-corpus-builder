Wadjet, also spelled Wadjit, also called Buto, Uto, or Edjo,  cobra goddess of ancient Egypt. Depicted as a cobra twined around a papyrus stem, she was the tutelary goddess of Lower Egypt. Wadjet and Nekhbet, the vulture-goddess of Upper Egypt, were the protective goddesses of the king and were sometimes represented together on the king’s diadem, symbolizing his reign over all of Egypt. The form of the rearing cobra on a crown is termed the uraeus. In mythology, Wadjet was nurse to the infant god Horus and helped Isis, his mother, protect him from his treacherous uncle, Seth, when she took refuge in the delta swamps. The similarity of this myth to the Greek story of Leto and Apollo on Delos probably resulted in the later identification of Wadjet with Leto.
Buto is the Greek form of the ancient Egyptian Per Wadjit (Coptic Pouto, “House of Wadjit”), the name of the capital of the 6th Lower Egyptian nome (province), present-day Tall al-Farāʿīn, of which the goddess was the local deity.
