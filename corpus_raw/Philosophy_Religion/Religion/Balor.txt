Balor,  in Celtic mythology, chief of the chaotic race of Fomoire—the demonic race that threatened the Irish people until they were subdued in the second great battle of Mag Tuired (Moytura). When Balor was a boy, he looked into a potion being brewed by his father’s Druids, and the fumes caused him to grow a huge, poisonous eye. The eye had to be opened by attendants, and it killed anything on which it gazed. Balor was eventually killed by his grandson, the god Lugus (Lugh), in the climactic battle between the Tuatha Dé Danann, or race of gods, and the Fomoire.
