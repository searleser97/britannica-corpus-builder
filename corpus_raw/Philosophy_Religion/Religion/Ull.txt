Ull, Old Norse Ullr,  in Norse mythology, a god associated with skis and the bow, according to the Icelandic poet and historian Snorri Sturluson in his Prose Edda. Ull is said there to be the handsome son of Sif and the stepson of her husband Thor. Ull possessed warrior-like attributes and was called upon for aid in individual combat. He resided at Ydalir (Yew Dales).
Although not much has been recorded about Ull, he must have been a very prominent deity in the Norse pantheon at one time because, according to one tradition, the god Odin offered Ull’s favours as a reward to the one who would aid him. In addition, Ull’s name appears as part of many Swedish and Norwegian place-names. In the chronicles of the Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus, Ollerus is the equivalent of Ull.
