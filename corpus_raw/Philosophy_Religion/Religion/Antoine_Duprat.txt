Antoine Duprat,   (born Jan. 17, 1463, Issoire, Fr.—died  July 9, 1535, Nantouillet), chancellor of France and cardinal known for his service as one of Francis I’s most trusted advisers.
Educated as a lawyer, Duprat began his government service as a judge in 1490 and served as attorney in the Parlement of Toulouse in 1495. Later he became a master of requests (in charge of petitions to the king) to Louis XII’s household (1503) and a president—eventually premier—of the Parlement of Paris (supreme court). A favourite of Louise of Savoy, mother of the future Francis I, he was entrusted with Francis’ education. On the latter’s accession to the throne, Duprat became chancellor of France. In this capacity he negotiated the Concordat of Bologna, which gave the king the power to choose his own bishops (1516).
After the concordat was signed, Duprat took holy orders and was given the bishoprics of Valence and Die (1522), Albi (1528), and Meaux (1534) and the archbishopric of Sens (1525). He was made cardinal in 1527 and papal legate in France in 1530. A determined adversary of the Reformation, he influenced Francis considerably on that problem.
