Jain vrata,  in Jainism, a religion of India, any of the vows (vratas) that govern the activities of both monks and laymen. The mahavratas, or five “great vows,” are undertaken for life only by ascetics and include vows of noninjury, abstention from lying and stealing, chastity, and renunciation of all possessions.
The laity, however, is not expected to observe these vows strictly. A layperson who has passed through the preliminary stages of spiritual discipline (gunasthana) may promise to observe 12 vows for a stated period of time and may renew the pledge at the completion of that time.
The first five vows, anuvratas, or partial vows (anu, “tiny,” as contrasted with maha, “big”), are more moderate versions of the mahavratas: abstinence from gross violence, gross falsehood, and gross stealing; contentment with one’s own wife; and limitation of one’s possessions. The remaining vows are the three gunavratas and the four shiksha-vratas, which are intended to encourage observance of the anuvratas. Although the lists of these commands differ, they generally include ceasing movement or restricting the area of one’s movements; abstaining from inflicting harmful punishment; renouncing or limiting the use of objects of enjoyment and comfort; practicing equanimity; fasting in the fashion of a monk and observing diet control; giving offerings, gifts, and services to monks and others; and voluntarily dying by self-starvation (sallekhana) when the observance of vows becomes physically impossible.
