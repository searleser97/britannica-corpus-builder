Anglo-Catholicism,   movement that emphasizes the Catholic rather than the Protestant heritage of the Anglican Communion. It was an outgrowth of the 19th-century Oxford Movement (q.v.), which sought to renew Catholic thought and practice in the Church of England. The term Anglo-Catholic was first used in some of the writings of leaders of the Oxford Movement who wished to demonstrate the historical continuity of the English (Anglican) Church with Catholic Christianity.
In addition to stressing Catholic elements in worship and theology, Anglo-Catholics have worked among the poor and unchurched and have attempted to renew the church. Although their beliefs and activities have often been opposed by Anglican Evangelicals, who stress the Protestant heritage of Anglicanism, Anglo-Catholics have continued to be an important force within the Anglican Communion.
Anglo-Catholics are sometimes called high churchmen, in that they give a “high” place to the importance of the episcopal form of church government, the sacraments, and liturgical worship. The term High Church was first used about the end of the 17th century to express this particular emphasis within the Church of England. Historically, however, High Church attitudes, like Low Church (Evangelical) attitudes, were evident within the Church of England from the time of Elizabeth I (1533–1603). The Oxford Movement and Anglo-Catholicism renewed this emphasis within Anglicanism. See also Broad Church.
