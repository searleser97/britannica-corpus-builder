Tao Hongjing, Wade-Giles romanization T’ao Hungching,  (born 451, Moling, China—died  536, Hua-yang), Chinese poet, calligrapher, physician, naturalist, and the most eminent Daoist of his time.
A precocious child, Tao was a tutor to the imperial court while still a youth. In 492 he retired to Mao Shan, a chain of hills southeast of Nanjing, to devote himself to the life and study of Daoism. There he established a mountain retreat where whole families lived under his spiritual guidance. Tao was an adviser and friend to the emperor, and his retreat survived the proscription of all other Daoist sects in 504.
The major work of Tao Hongjing was the editing and annotation of the religious writings of Yang Xi, Xu Mi, and Xu Hui, composed at Mao Shan in the 4th century. This enormous body of work includes Daoist scriptures, lives, and visionary dictations (dictées) that are the highest literary achievement of the formative period of esoteric Daoism. Tao produced two compendiums of the literature, the Zhengao (“Declarations of the Perfected”) and the Dengzhen yinjue (“Secret Instructions for Ascent to Perfection”).
At Mao Shan, Tao attempted to recreate the daily practices of Daoism laid down in these works in their original setting. In the course of his research into proper eating and living practices, he produced the Tujing yanyi bencao, one of the major pharmacological works of China. Tao also effected a working synthesis of the private and individual practices of the Mao Shan literature with the 4th-century public rites of the Lingbao liturgies. His writings on the Lingbao pantheon reveal his familiarity with Buddhist as well as Daoist literature.
