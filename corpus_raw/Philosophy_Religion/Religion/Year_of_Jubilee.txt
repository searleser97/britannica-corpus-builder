Year of Jubilee, also called Holy Year,  in the Roman Catholic Church, a celebration that is observed on certain special occasions and for 1 year every 25 years, under certain conditions, when a special indulgence is granted to members of the faith by the pope and confessors are given special faculties, including the lifting of censures. It resembles the Old Testament Jubilee—in which, every 50 years, the Hebrews celebrated a year of perfect rest, emancipated slaves, and restored hereditary property—but does not seem to be based on it.
Pope Boniface VIII established the Holy Year in 1300 as a centenary observance. In 1342 Clement VI reduced the interval to 50 years, and in 1470 Paul II further reduced it to 25 years. The year begins on Christmas Eve, with the opening of the Holy Doors at the Roman basilicas of St. Peter, St. John Lateran, St. Paul Outside-the-Walls, and Santa Maria Maggiore, and ends with their closing on the following Christmas Eve. Since 1500 the Jubilee has been extended to the whole world during the year following the Holy Year, and certain churches in each diocese are designated for visitation.
Since at least 1560, special jubilees have been declared. That year the occasion was the Council of Trent, for which the guidance of the Holy Spirit was invoked. Special jubilees have been declared for a pope’s 50th anniversary in the priesthood (Pope Pius XI, 1929), at the close of the Second Vatican Council (1965) to promote the knowledge and application of the council’s achievements, and on many other occasions. Pope John Paul II declared 2000 a Great Year of Jubilee in celebration of the new millennium. Pope Francis I declared 2016 an Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy to encourage Catholics to practice corporal and spiritual acts of mercy, such as feeding the hungry or forgiving wrongdoing. To this end, he also gave all priests the temporary authority to grant absolution for abortions, a power he made permanent in an apostolic letter issued in 2016.
