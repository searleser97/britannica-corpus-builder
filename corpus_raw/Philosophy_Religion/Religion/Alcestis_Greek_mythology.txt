Alcestis,  in Greek legend, the beautiful daughter of Pelias, king of Iolcos. She is the heroine of the eponymous play by the dramatist Euripides (c. 484–406 bce). According to legend, the god Apollo helped Admetus, son of the king of Pherae, to harness a lion and a boar to a chariot in order to win Alcestis’s hand. When Apollo learned that Admetus had not long to live, he persuaded the Fates, the goddesses who determine human destiny, to prolong his life. The Fates imposed the condition that someone else die in Admetus’s stead, which Alcestis, a loyal wife, consented to do. The warrior Heracles rescued Alcestis by wrestling at her grave with Death.
