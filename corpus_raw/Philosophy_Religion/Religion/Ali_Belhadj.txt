Ali Belhadj, also spelled ʿAlī Bel Ḥajj,  (born c. 1956, Tunisia), deputy leader of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), an Algerian political party.
Born to Algerian parents, he became a high-school teacher and an imam. He and the more moderate Abbasi al-Madani registered FIS as a political party in 1989, and in 1990 FIS won a majority of votes in local elections. In 1991 the Algerian government announced martial law and imprisoned Belhadj and al-Madani. In 1994 Belhadj was transferred to house arrest. Both men were released in 2003. Belhadj was imprisoned again in 2005 for making statements in support of the insurgency in Iraq but was released the following year. In 2011 he was briefly arrested for participating in anti-government protests. That year his son Abdelkahar Belhadj, who was involved with al-Qaeda, was killed during a confrontation with soldiers at a checkpoint in Algeria.
