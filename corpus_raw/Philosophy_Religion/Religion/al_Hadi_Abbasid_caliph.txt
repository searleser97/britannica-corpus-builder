Al-Hādī, in full al Hādī Ila al Ḥaqq, also called Mūsā al-Hādī,  (died 786), fourth caliph of the ʿAbbāsid dynasty (reigned 785–786).
Al-Hādī’s persecution of the ʿAlids, representatives of the Shīʿīte sect of Islām, precipitated revolts in Medina, Egypt, and Iraq, all of which were put down brutally. Throughout his short reign, he struggled with the question of succession, attempting to annul the rights of his brother, Hārūn ar-Rashīd, who was later to become one of the most famous rulers of the ʿAbbāsid dynasty. At the time of al-Hādī’s death, which may have been a murder, ar-Rashīd was imprisoned and then later was released to assume the caliphate.
