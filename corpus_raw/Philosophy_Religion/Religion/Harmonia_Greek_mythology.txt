Harmonia,  in Greek mythology, the daughter of Ares and Aphrodite, according to the Theban account; in Samothrace she was the daughter of Zeus and the Pleiad Electra. She was carried off by Cadmus, and all the gods honoured the wedding with their presence. Cadmus or one of the gods presented the bride with a robe and necklace, the work of Hephaestus. This necklace brought misfortune to all who possessed it; it led to the death of Amphiaraus, Eriphyle, Alcmaeon, and Phegeus and his sons. Both Harmonia and Cadmus were ultimately metamorphosed into snakes. Harmonia is also the name given to the Greek personification of the order and symmetry of the universe. In Roberto Calassoâ€™s international best seller, The Marriage of Cadmus and Harmony (1988; Le nozze di Cadmo e Armonia), the wedding of Cadmus and Harmonia marks the last time gods and mortals met on friendly terms, the end of the golden age of myth.
