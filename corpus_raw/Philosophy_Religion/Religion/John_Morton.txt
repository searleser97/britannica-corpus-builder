John Morton,  (born c. 1420, Bere Regis or Milborne St. Andrew, Dorset, Eng.—died  Oct. 12, 1500, Knole, Kent), archbishop of Canterbury and cardinal, one of the most powerful men in England in the reign of King Henry VII.
During the Wars of the Roses between the houses of York and Lancaster, Morton favoured the Lancastrian cause. He received minor ecclesiastical posts under the Lancastrian monarch Henry VI, but upon the accession of the Yorkist Edward IV, in 1461, he was declared a traitor and forced to sue for a pardon. In 1470 Morton helped assemble the coalition of Lancastrians and disaffected Yorkists that drove Edward IV from the country. Nevertheless, after Edward regained his throne in 1471, Morton was given ambassadorial posts and appointed bishop of Ely (1479). When Edward’s brother seized the throne as King Richard III in 1483, Morton became one of Richard’s bitterest enemies. While imprisoned by Richard in Brecon (Brecknock) Castle, the bishop helped plot the unsuccessful uprising led by Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham (October 1483). Morton then escaped to Flanders.
Upon his return to England after Henry VII assumed the throne in 1485, he became one of the most trusted and influential royal advisers. He was made archbishop of Canterbury in 1486, lord chancellor in 1487, and cardinal in 1493. Traditionally, Morton has been known as the inventor of “Morton’s Fork,” a sophistical dilemma imposed on both rich and poor by Henry’s tax commissioners in order to extort funds for the crown. The rich were told that they could afford to contribute, and the poor were accused of having concealed wealth.
