Shinsen,   in the Shint≈ç religion of Japan, food offerings presented to the kami (god or sacred power). The dishes may vary according to the shrine, the deity honoured, and the occasion of worship, but they generally consist of rice, sake (rice wine), rice cake, fish, fowl, meat, seaweed, vegetables, fruits or sweets, salt, and water. The shinsen is prepared with meticulous care, often of food especially cultivated for the purpose. During agricultural and other festivals (see matsuri), the shinsen may consist of the first fruits or first rice sheaves of the harvest. Shinsen is also distinguished by the manner in which the food is prepared, either cooked ( jukusen) or raw (seisen), or entirely vegetarian (sosen). The consecrated food is consumed after the ceremony at a feast usually attended by the priests and worshippers.
