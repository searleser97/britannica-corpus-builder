Deoband school, Arabic Dār al-ʿulūm (“House of Learning”), also spelled Darul Uloom,  the leading Muslim theological centre (madrasah) of India. It was founded in 1867 by Muḥammad ʿĀbid Ḥusayn in the Sahāranpur district of Uttar Pradesh. The theological position of Deoband has always been heavily influenced by the 18th-century Muslim reformer Shāh Walī Allāh and the early 19th-century Indian Wahhābiyyah, giving it a very puritanical and orthodox outlook.
The program of studies is highly traditional, stressing jurisprudence (fiqh), Qurʾānic exegesis (tafsīr), the study of traditions (Hadith), scholastic theology (kalām), and philosophy (falsafah). While many other madrasahs, such as those in Qom, Iran, or Al-Azhar University in Cairo, stress the importance of studying modern disciplines, the Deoband school rejects them as irrelevant to a proper knowledge of Islam and leading to sinful innovation (bidʿah). The modern practice of Islam is studied only in order to purify it of unorthodox accretions. The student is thus prepared mainly for religious leadership of the Muslim community.
Deoband’s enrollment of about 5,000 students is culled from all parts of the Muslim world. The madrasah boasts a library of more than 100,000 printed books and manuscripts in Arabic, Persian, Urdu, and more than a dozen other languages. A mosque, lecture halls, and student residences further serve the scholarly community.
