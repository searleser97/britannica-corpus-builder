Acts of the Apostles, abbreviation Acts,  fifth book of the New Testament, a valuable history of the early Christian church. Acts was written in Greek, presumably by St. Luke the Evangelist. The Gospel According to Luke concludes where Acts begins, namely, with Christ’s Ascension into heaven. Acts was apparently written in Rome, perhaps between 70 and 90 ce, though some think a slightly earlier date is also possible.
After an introductory account of the descent of the Holy Spirit on the Apostles at Pentecost (interpreted as the birth of the church), Luke pursues as a central theme the spread of Christianity to the Gentile world under the guiding inspiration of the Holy Spirit. He also describes the church’s gradual drawing away from Jewish traditions. The conversion of St. Paul and his subsequent missionary journeys are given a prominent place because this close associate of Luke was the preeminent Apostle to the Gentiles. Without Acts, a picture of the primitive church would be impossible to reconstruct; with it, the New Testament letters of St. Paul are far more intelligible. Acts concludes rather abruptly after Paul has successfully preached the gospel in Rome, then the acknowledged centre of the Gentile world.
