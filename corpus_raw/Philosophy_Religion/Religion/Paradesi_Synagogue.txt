Paradesi Synagogue,  oldest synagogue in India, located in Kochi (formerly Cochin), Kerala state. It was one of the traditional houses of worship of the Cochin (or Kerala) Jews. In the early 21st century it was the community’s only active synagogue in India.
The synagogue was built in 1568 by the city’s prosperous Jewish trading community, originally consisting of Sephardic Jews who had been exiled from Spain and Portugal decades earlier. The consolidation of Portuguese power in western India in the mid-16th century saw the beginning of a turbulent period for the city’s Jewish community, as local officials of the Inquisition attempted to extirpate the religion, and the synagogue was destroyed by fire in 1662. However, with the subsequent Dutch settlement of the surrounding Malabar Coast in 1663, prosperity returned to the Jewish community, and the synagogue was restored.
The structure stands as a white-walled rectangular building with a tile roof and wrought-iron gates decorated with the Star of David. A Dutch-style clock tower with four clocks, featuring four different numeral styles—Hebrew, Roman, Malayalam, and Arabic—was added by the Dutch East India Company’s principal merchant in India, Ezekiel Rahabi, in the mid-18th century.
The synagogue houses gold- and silver-decorated Torah scrolls, an intricately carved teak ark, a rug that was a gift of the Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie I, paintings portraying Jewish history, and Belgian crystal chandeliers and decorative lamps in silver, brass, and glass. A unique feature is the hand-painted tiles paving the floor, which were brought from China. The synagogue’s most-cherished possessions are the 1,600-year-old copper plates on which are inscribed the community’s charter of independence and the privileges granted to the Jewish community by the raja of Cochin.
