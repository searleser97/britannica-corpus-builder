Hou Tu, Wade-Giles romanization Hou Tâ€™u,  in Chinese mythology, the spirit of the earth, first worshipped in 113 bce by Wudi, a Han-dynasty emperor. Hou Tu as sovereign earth became identified with the dual patron deity of the soil and harvest, Sheji, and so received sacrifices under this title. In any case, it was the god of the soil who became personified in the person of Gou Long, a hero related to Shen Nong, the legendary Chinese father of agriculture.
At various times and in various places Hou Tu seems also to have had a cult as the spirit of humanity, as the national earth god (as distinguished from local deities called Tudi Gong), and as the spirit of deceased emperors and empresses. In the latter part of the 14th century Hou Tu, for no clear reason, became a female deity. Modern temples thus enshrine the image of a woman who is known as Hou Tu Nainai.
