Melchor Cano,  Melchor also spelled Melchior,  (born c. 1509, Tarancon, Spain—died  Sept. 30, 1560, Toledo), Dominican theologian and bishop who upheld the rights of the Spanish crown against the claims of the papacy.
A professor of theology in Salamanca, and later at Valladolid (1546–52), he was sent by Emperor Charles V to the Council of Trent (1551–52), where he participated actively in discussions on the Eucharist and on penance. Cano strongly opposed the influence of his fellow Dominican Bartolome de Carranza, whom he accused of Lutheranism. Cano’s close association with the anti-papal policies of King Philip II of Spain incurred the enmity of Pope Paul IV. The Holy See did not confirm his election as Provincial of the Dominicans (1557) and delayed confirmation of his reelection (1559). His reputation as a theologian rests on his De locis theologicis (posthumously published in 1563), an analysis of the scientific value of theological statements, which led him to evaluate the sources of theology. He also wrote commentaries on the Pauline epistles.
