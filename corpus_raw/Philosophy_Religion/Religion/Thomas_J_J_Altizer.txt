Thomas J.J. Altizer, in full Thomas Jonathan Jackson Altizer,  (born May 28, 1927, Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S.—died November 28, 2018, Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania), American radical theologian associated with the Death of God movement in the 1960s and ’70s.
A graduate of the University of Chicago (A.B. 1948, A.M. 1951, Ph.D. 1955), Altizer taught religion first at Wabash College (Crawfordsville, Indiana) from 1954 to 1956 and then at Emory University (Atlanta, Georgia) from 1956 to 1968 before becoming a professor of English at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.
Altizer insisted “We must recognize that the death of God is a historical event: God has died in our time, in our history, in our existence.” His ideas were developed in articles and books, including Mircea Eliade and the Dialectic of the Sacred (1963), The Gospel of Christian Atheism (1966), Radical Theology and the Death of God, with William Hamilton (1966), Descent into Hell (1970), The Self-Embodiment of God (1977), and Total Presence (1980).
