Soul loss,  departure of the soul from the body and its failure to return. In many preliterate cultures soul loss is believed to be a primary cause of illness and death.
In some cultures individuals are believed to have one soul that may wander inadvertently when its owner’s guard is relaxed, as when asleep, sneezing, or yawning. Other cultures believe that each person has two or more souls, usually including a “wandering” soul that experiences one’s dreams and a “life” soul that maintains one’s corporeal vitality. The most dangerous instances of soul loss involve malevolent witchcraft and the enticement and capture of a soul in order to cause harm to its owner (see also sorcery).
Those who believe in soul loss hold that an owner can prevent the soul from wandering by means of ritual utterances, such as saying “God bless” when one sneezes, or by a variety of supernatural means, such as the wearing of charms or ingesting of magical substances. However, in cases where the soul’s owner believes he or she has been bewitched, soul retrieval requires complex techniques and the services of a religious specialist. The essence of most cures is the catching of the lost soul by a shaman and its reintroduction into the patient’s body.
