Mystical body of Christ,  in Roman Catholicism, a mystical union of all Christians into a spiritual body with Jesus Christ as their head. The concept is rooted in the New Testament and possibly reflects Christianity’s roots in Judaism; St. Paul’s letters to the Corinthians and Romans both use the image of a body, with a head (Christ) and many members (Christians) to describe the relationship between Christ and Christians. Later, the Church Fathers, including St. Augustine, reaffirmed and amplified Paul’s assertion that the Christian church is a spiritual extension of Christ’s body.
Pope Pius XII popularized the phrase in his encyclical Mystici corporis christi (1943). The Second Vatican Council issued the “Dogmatic Constitution on the Church,” or Lumen Gentium (1964; “Light of the Nations”), which reflected the broader, universal nature of the mystical body by stating that all persons are members of the church, at least potentially, because Christ came to offer salvation to everyone.
