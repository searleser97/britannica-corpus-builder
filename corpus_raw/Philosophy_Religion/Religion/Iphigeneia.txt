Iphigeneia,   in Greek mythology, eldest daughter of Agamemnon, king of Mycenae, and his wife Clytemnestra. Her father had to sacrifice her to the goddess Artemis in order that the Achaean fleet, of which he was leader, might be delivered from the calm (or contrary winds) by which Artemis was detaining it at Aulis and proceed on its way to the siege of Troy.
Iphigeneia served as a key figure in certain Greek tragedies: in the Agamemnon of Aeschylus, in the Electra of Sophocles, in Euripides’ unfinished Iphigeneia in Aulis, and in his earlier play Iphigeneia in Tauris, in which she was saved by Artemis, who substituted a hind. Variants of her story are found in later authors. In some localities she was identified with Artemis, and some ancient writers claimed that Iphigeneia was originally the goddess Hecate.
Iphigeneia’s story was also popular with later European dramatists, providing the plot of the Iphigénie by Racine and of the Iphigenie auf Tauris of Goethe. Racine’s play was the basis for Gluck’s opera Iphigénie en Aulide.
