Vairagin, Sanskrit vairāgin,  in Hinduism, a religious ascetic who worships principally one or another form of the god Vishnu. Vairagins generally wear white robes, in contrast to the ochre-coloured robes worn by Shaivite (devoted to the god Shiva) ascetics, and are also differentiated by their tilak (mark on the forehead), which is never made of ash and is always vertical in design.
Most vairagins, when not wandering or on pilgrimage, reside in monastic communities called sthanas (“spots” or “places”), but the naga (“naked”) vairagins, who are also the militants among the Vaishnava (devoted to Vishnu) ascetics, form their own groups, called akharias. In the past, battles between groups of naked ascetics belonging to different sects centred mainly on bathing and processional rights during pilgrimage assemblies, such as those of the Kumbh Mela festival.
