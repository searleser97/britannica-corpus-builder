Pabbajjā, (Pāli: “to wander forth”, ) Sanskrit Pravrajyā,  Buddhist rite of ordination by which a layman becomes a novice (Pāli sāmaṇera; Sanskrit śrāmaṇera). The ceremony is also the preliminary part of higher ordination, raising a novice to a monk (see upasaṃpadā).
In some Theravāda countries such as Burma, the rite is normally held for every Buddhist boy at the age of puberty. In Tibet and China a probationary period of study is required before the candidate becomes a novice, during which he does not receive tonsure and is not exempt from military service.
Details of the ceremony vary from country to country. In most instances, the candidate appears before an assembly of 10 (in some cases fewer) ordained monks and asks for admission to the order as a novice. His head and face are shaved, and he presents the upper and lower robes of the novice for consecration by the officiating abbot or senior monk. The candidate puts on the monastic robes and returns. He then asks for the Threefold Refuge (in the Buddha, the teaching, and the order) and the 10 precepts (ethical code; see sīla) to be administered to him. The rite is concluded with his obeisance to the senior monks and his request for forgiveness of his faults.
The novice lives in the monastery for a period varying from a few days to several months and accompanies the monk on the daily alms rounds, but he is not allowed to participate in the fortnightly recitation of the patimokkha (the rules of monastic discipline).
