Uranus,  in Greek mythology, the personification of heaven. According to Hesiod’s Theogony, Gaea (Earth), emerging from primeval Chaos, produced Uranus, the Mountains, and the Sea. From Gaea’s subsequent union with Uranus were born the Titans, the Cyclopes, and the Hecatoncheires.
Uranus hated his offspring and hid them in Gaea’s body. She appealed to them for vengeance, but Cronus (a Titan) alone responded. With the harpē (a scimitar) he removed Uranus’ testicles as he approached Gaea. From the drops of Uranus’ blood that fell on her were born the Furies, the Giants, and the Meliai (ash-tree nymphs). The severed genitals floated on the sea, producing a white foam, from which sprang the goddess of love, Aphrodite. Cronus by his action had separated Heaven and Earth. Uranus also had other consorts: Hestia, Nyx, Hemera, and Clymene.
There was no cult of Uranus in classical Greece. This circumstance, together with the story’s resemblance to Asian legends, suggests pre-Greek origins. The use of the harpē points to an Asian source, and the story bears a close resemblance to the Hittite myth of Kumarbi.
