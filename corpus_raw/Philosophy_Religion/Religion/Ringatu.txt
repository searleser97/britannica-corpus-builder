Ringatū,  Māori prophetic movement in New Zealand. It was founded in 1867 by the Māori guerrilla leader Te Kooti (1830–93) while he was imprisoned in the Chatham Islands. His deep Bible study produced a new gentle Māori religion that included traditional taboos and faith healing. The movement spread following Te Kooti’s escape to the mainland in 1868 and his pardon in 1883.
Services are held in tribal meetinghouses on Saturdays and on the 12th day of each month, when a love feast and a communion without bread or wine is celebrated. The memorized liturgy includes thematic medleys of Bible verses, songs, chants, and prayers and ends with members raising their right hand in homage (hence Ringatū, or “Upraised Hand”). Te Kooti is celebrated as prophet and martyr, and Ringatū identified with suffering Israel. The liturgy was first printed in the 1960s as The Book of the Eight Covenants of God and Prayers of the Ringatu Church.
