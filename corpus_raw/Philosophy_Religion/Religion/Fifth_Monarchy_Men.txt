Fifth Monarchy Men,   an extreme Puritan sect that came into prominence in England during the Commonwealth and Protectorate. They were so called from their belief that the time of the fifth monarchy was at hand—that is, the monarchy that (according to a traditional interpretation of parts of the Bible) should succeed the Assyrian, Persian, Greek, and Roman monarchies and during which Christ should reign on earth with his saints for 1,000 years. After the fall of the monarchy, they at first supported Oliver Cromwell. The Nominated, or Barebones, Parliament of 1653, chosen from nominees of the Independent churches, raised their hopes of speedily accomplishing the rule of the saints. The establishment of the Protectorate, however, dashed these hopes and turned the sect against Cromwell. The violence of their agitation led to the arrest of their leaders—Thomas Harrison, Robert Overton, Christopher Feake, John Rogers, and others. An attempt at an armed uprising, led by Thomas Venner in April 1657, was easily suppressed. Venner attempted another, equally abortive uprising in January 1661. He and a number of others were executed, and the special doctrines of the sect died out.
