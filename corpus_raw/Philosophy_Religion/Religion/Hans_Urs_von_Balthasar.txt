Hans Urs von Balthasar,  (born August 12, 1905, Lucerne, Switzerland—died June 26, 1988, Basel), Swiss Roman Catholic theologian who rejected the ultraconservatism of the French schismatic archbishop Marcel Lefebvre and the progressive views of the Swiss theologian Hans Küng in favour of a deeply personal spirituality.
Balthasar studied philosophy at the Universities of Vienna, Berlin, and Zürich, earning a Ph.D. from the latter in 1929. He was ordained a priest in 1936 and entered the Jesuit order in 1939. He served as a chaplain at the University of Basel (1940–48) before leaving the Jesuits in 1950 to direct a Catholic organization (the Community of St. John, a secular institute) he had founded in Basel five years earlier with the Christian mystic Adrienne von Speyr.
Balthasar authored more than 60 books on such diverse topics as the theology of history, the early Christian Church Fathers, classical literature, and modern aestheticism. He wrote much of his early work as a rebuttal to the writings of his friend and rival the Swiss Protestant theologian Karl Barth. In 1972 Balthasar cofounded the Catholic journal Communio with the French theologian Henri de Lubac and Joseph Ratzinger, the future Pope Benedict XVI.
Balthasar was greatly admired by Pope John Paul II, and in 1984 he was awarded the first Paul VI International Prize for his contributions to theology. He was named a cardinal in 1988 but died two days before his investiture.
