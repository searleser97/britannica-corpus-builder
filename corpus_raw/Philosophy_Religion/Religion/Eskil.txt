Eskil,   (born c. 1100, Denmark—died  September 1182, Clairvaux, France), archbishop who restored the unity of the Danish church and championed its independence.
A nephew of Asser, the first archbishop of Lund (now in Sweden) and thereby primate of Scandinavia, Eskil became bishop of Roskilde in 1134 and archbishop of Lund in 1138. During the 1150s he was forced to accept the division of Sweden and Norway into separate ecclesiastical provinces, but he retained primacy over Uppsala (in Sweden).
Eskil’s advocacy of radical reform of the church and of its independence from secular authority brought him into conflict with the Danish king Valdemar I, whom he had helped attain power (1157). In 1170, after a reconciliation, Eskil canonized the king’s father and anointed Valdemar’s son Canute IV as joint king, initiating the hereditary rule of the Valdemar dynasty. After naming Absalon, the bishop of Roskilde and Valdemar’s chief adviser, his successor (1177), Eskil was soon forced into exile in France when his relatives plotted to overthrow the king.
Along with Absalon, Eskil introduced the first ecclesiastical laws to Denmark and was a great founder of monasteries. French monks who entered the country under his influence made important contributions to agriculture, architecture, and science.
