Basava,  (flourished 12th century, South India), Hindu religious reformer, teacher, theologian, and administrator of the royal treasury of the Kalachuri-dynasty king Bijjala I (reigned 1156–67). Basava is the subject of the Basava-purana, one of the sacred texts of the Hindu Lingayat sect.
According to South Indian oral tradition, he was the actual founder of the Lingayats, but study of Kalachuri inscriptions indicates that, rather than founding a new sect, he in fact revived an existing one. His life and doctrines were recorded in the Basava-purana, written by Bhima Kavi (14th century) in the Kannada language and based on an earlier Telugu version by Palkuriki Somanatha.
Basava helped to spread the Lingayat sect by teaching and by dispersing funds to Lingayat guilds. It was his uncle, a prime minister, who first used his influence at court to secure an appointment for his erudite relative. Basava was appointed chief of the treasury, and for several years he and his faction enjoyed a great deal of popularity. But other factions at court were apparently resentful of his power and the flourishing of Lingayat mendicants under his patronage. As a result of their accusations, he fled the kingdom, dying soon thereafter. His poetry to Shiva as “lord of the meeting rivers” earned him a place at the front rank of Kannada literature and the literature of Hindu devotion (bhakti) generally.
