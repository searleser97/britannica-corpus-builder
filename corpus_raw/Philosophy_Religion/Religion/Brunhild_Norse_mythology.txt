Brunhild, also spelled Brynhild, Brunhilda, Brunhilde, or Brünhild,  a beautiful Amazon-like princess in ancient Germanic heroic literature, known originally from Old Norse sources (the Edda poems and the Vǫlsunga saga) and from the Nibelungenlied in German and more recently from Richard Wagner’s late 19th-century opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen (“The Ring of the Nibelung”), adapted from the Nibelungenlied. In the Eddic poems in which she appears, Brunhild plays the leading role. In the Nibelungenlied, because of a shift of emphasis, her prominence is greatly reduced.
Common to both, and no doubt original, is the conception of Brunhild as the central figure of a story in which she vows to marry only a man of the most outstanding qualities and one that can surpass her in strength. One man, Siegfried, is able to fulfill her conditions, but he woos and wins her not for himself but for another. When Brunhild discovers this deception, she exacts vengeance, which results in the death of Siegfried.
In some of the Norse sources, Brunhild has supernatural qualities and is described as a Valkyrie; it is still a matter of dispute whether these attributes are an accretion or whether their absence from the German version is an omission. Many critics, who doubt their originality in the Norse, seek the source of the poetic figure in the history of the Merovingian kings of the Franks, in which Queen Brunhild plays an important part; the name is also found in place-names and field names in the region of the Rhine and in northeastern France and Belgium, but this could have resulted from the popularity of the literary figure.
