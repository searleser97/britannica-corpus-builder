Wuwei, (Chinese: “nonaction”; literally, “no action”) Wade-Giles romanization wu-wei,  in Chinese philosophy, and particularly among the 4th- and 3rd-century-bce philosophers of early Daoism (daojia), the practice of taking no action that is not in accord with the natural course of the universe.
Chinese thinkers of the Warring States period (475–221 bce) envisioned a dynamic universe that was constantly being generated. According to the Daoists, the entirety of the cosmos unfolds spontaneously (ziran) through the incessant fluctuations of the Way (Dao). All things in the universe—including all human beings—have in accord with this cosmic Way their own natural course, which, if unimpeded, leads to flourishing. However, human beings—through logical thought, language, culture, and government—often interfere with this natural course, forsaking spontaneity for artifice.
The best-known use of the term wuwei is found in the Daodejing, a philosophical and spiritual text written about 300 bce and featuring naturalistic and quasi-mystical overtones. The Daodejing characterizes nonaction as both the manner in which the Way constantly generates the cosmos and the method through which the sage-king, or ideal ruler, most effectively governs. It states, “The Way does nothing, and yet nothing remains unaccomplished” (wuwei er wu buwei). So too the sage-king rules by cultivating within himself a constant awareness of and responsiveness to this natural Way. By taking no unnatural action, he actualizes the Way within his own life; he also influences his subjects toward natural action and promotes a flourishing rather than a stagnant kingdom.
