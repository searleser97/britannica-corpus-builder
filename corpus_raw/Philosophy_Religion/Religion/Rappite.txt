Rappite,  a member of a religious communal group founded in the United States in the early 19th century by about 600 German Pietists under the leadership of George Rapp, a farmer and vine grower.
Protesting the growing rationalism of Lutheranism, the group decided to leave Germany for America. Rapp and his son went to western Pennsylvania in 1803, where they purchased 5,000 acres of land, and were soon joined by their followers. But the land was not suitable for vine and fruit culture, the main economic activity of the community. In 1815 a new village, with 800 members, was built near the mouth of the Wabash River in Indiana and was called Harmony (or Harmonie).
Rapp ran the community with a strong paternal hand. He heard the confessions of all who joined, and anyone who sinned confessed to him before the day ended. All quarrels were settled the same day they occurred. Shortly after coming to the United States, the Rappites renounced marriage, and eventually all persons lived in celibacy.
After 10 years in Indiana, Rapp decided that the colony should move again. Harmony was sold in 1825 for $150,000 to Robert Owen, who established a socialist community there, which he called New Harmony. The Rappites moved to a site 18 miles from Pittsburgh, Pa., and established a new village called Economy.
In 1831 a new member from Germany, who called himself Count de Leon, began encouraging marriage and the enjoyment of luxury. He persuaded about 200 members to secede and demand their share from the common fund. For the next several years the colony was involved in court suits.
Rapp died in 1847, and thereafter the colony membership dwindled. In 1866 about 250 remaining members controlled a property the value of which was estimated to be as high as $20 million but which was probably much less. Membership continued to decrease until only a few remained in 1900. The communityâ€™s affairs were finally settled by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1905, and the Rappites disbanded in 1906.
