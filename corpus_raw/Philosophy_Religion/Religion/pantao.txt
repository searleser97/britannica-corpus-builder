Pantao, (Chinese: “flat peach”) Wade-Giles romanization p’an-t’ao,  in Chinese Daoist mythology, the peach of immortality that grew in the garden of Xiwangmu (“Queen Mother of the West”). When the fruit ripened every 3,000 years, the event was celebrated by a sumptuous banquet attended by the Baxian (“Eight Immortals”).
Xiwangmu presented the pantao to such favoured mortals as the ancient Zhou-dynasty emperor Muwang and the Han-dynasty emperor Wudi (141/140–87/86 bce). The first Ming-dynasty emperor (late 14th century ce) is said to have been presented with a pantao stone identified, by 10 engraved characters, as formerly belonging to Wudi. Flat peaches from Zhejiang province were sent each year to the imperial palace in Beijing before the founding of the Chinese Republic (1911/12).
