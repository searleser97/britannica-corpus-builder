Gomarist, also called Contra-remonstrant, or Counter-remonstrant,  follower of the Dutch Calvinist theologian Franciscus Gomarus (1563–1641), who upheld the theological position known as supralapsarianism, which claimed that God is not the author of sin yet accepted the Fall of Man as an active decree of God. They also opposed toleration for Roman Catholics, for Jews, and for other Protestants. In opposing the Gomarists, Johan van Oldenbarnevelt, one of the Netherlands’ great statesmen, became embroiled in a religious controversy that had political implications, and he eventually was found guilty of treason and executed. At about the same time the Gomarists took control of the Dutch Reformed Church. Their intransigence helped lead to renewal of war with Spain in 1621.
