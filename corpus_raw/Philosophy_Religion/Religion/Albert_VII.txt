Albert VII, also called Albrecht or Albertus,  (born November 11, 1559, Wiener Neustadt, Austria—died July 13, 1621, Brussels, Spanish Netherlands [now in Belgium]), cardinal archduke of Austria who as governor and sovereign prince of the Low Countries (1598–1621) ruled the Spanish Netherlands jointly with his wife, Isabella, infanta of Spain.
The son of the Holy Roman emperor Maximilian II and Maria, daughter of Charles V, Albert was educated for an ecclesiastical career at the court of his uncle, King Philip II of Spain. Although appointed archbishop and cardinal of Toledo (Spain) in 1577, Albert served Philip not as a prelate but as a soldier and diplomat; he governed Portugal as Philip’s viceroy from 1581 to 1595. After the death of his elder brother, Ernst, governor of the Netherlands, in February 1595, he was appointed governor-general by Philip and given the task of subduing the rebellious Protestants in the seven United Provinces of the north. At Philip’s insistence, Albert reluctantly obtained a papal release from holy orders and dispensation to marry Philip’s daughter, the infanta Isabella. He received joint sovereignty of the Low Countries in 1598 as dowry for his marriage (April 1599) to Isabella. Because Albert could effect neither a military defeat of the United Provinces nor a political reconciliation, he and Isabella controlled only the 10 Roman Catholic provinces of the south. After several years of inconclusive fighting, an armistice was arranged with the Dutch in April 1607, and a 12-year truce began in 1609. During the truce period Albert strengthened the Catholic religion in the Spanish Netherlands and did much to promote the arts.
