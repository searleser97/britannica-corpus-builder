Medb, also spelled Medhbh,  legendary queen of Connaught (Connacht) in Ireland who figures in the Ulster cycle, a group of legends from ancient Irish literature.
In the epic tale Táin bó Cuailnge (“The Cattle Raid of Cooley”), Medb instigates the eponymous raid, leading her forces against those of Ulster. Whereas other war goddesses influence the outcome of the battle through their magical powers, Medb fights using weapons. She is depicted as a fierce and libidinous goddess: at the time of the battle against Ulster, the king Ailill is her mate, but she also has an affair with the mighty hero Fergus, distinguished for his prodigious virility. Medb had a sacred tree, bile Medb, and was often represented with a squirrel and a bird sitting on her shoulders.
