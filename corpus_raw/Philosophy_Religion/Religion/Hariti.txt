Hārītī, Japanese Kishi-mojin,  in Buddhist mythology, a child-devouring ogress who is said to have been converted from her cannibalistic habits by the Buddha to become a protectress of children. He hid the youngest of her own 500 children under his begging bowl, and thus made her realize the sorrow she was causing other parents. Hārītī is usually represented surrounded by children or carrying a child, a pomegranate, or a cornucopia. Her cult traveled north into Central Asia and China, where she is regarded as the special guardian of children and of women in childbirth, and to Japan, where she has sometimes been confounded with a feminine form of the protective deity, Kannon.
