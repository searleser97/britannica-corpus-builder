Antonio Escobar y Mendoza,  (born 1589, Valladolid, Spain—died  July 4, 1669, Valladolid), Spanish Jesuit preacher and moral theologian who was derided for his support of probabilism, the theory according to which when the rightness or wrongness of a course of action is in doubt, any probable right course may be followed, even if an opposed course appears more probable. The issue of probabilism became important in the 17th century, when social and cultural developments, such as banking, came into conflict with traditional moral precepts, resulting in many difficult tests of conscience.
Escobar entered the Society of Jesus in 1597 and became a distinguished scholar and noted preacher. His principal detractor over his support of probabilism was Blaise Pascal, French scientist and religious philosopher. Escobar is quoted with derision and indignation in Pascal’s Provincial Letters, nos. v–ix. An opponent of the Jesuits, Pascal ridiculed Escobar and his confreres as teachers of lax moral principles who believed that the end justifies the means. He was also attacked by such noted French authors as Molière and Jean de La Fontaine. Some scholars find that these attacks are unfounded if Escobar’s words are taken in context. His collected writings comprise 32 volumes on biblical, sacred, and moral subjects.
