Maximus Margunios,  (born, Crete—died  1602, Venice [Italy]), Greek Orthodox bishop and humanist exponent of Greek culture in Italy, whose attempt to reconcile the theologies of the Eastern and Western churches aroused in Byzantine churchmen suspicion of his orthodoxy.
After his education at the University of Padua, a centre for Greek scholars, Margunios became a monk in 1579, possibly at the monastery of St. Catherine, near Candia (Iráklion), Crete, where he first studied Greek literature. Later he was made bishop of Kíthira (Kythera), a Venetian-controlled island off western Greece. Prevented for many years by Venetian authorities from living in his diocese, he stayed chiefly with the Greek Orthodox community in Venice, where he became headmaster of the Greek College and assisted Greek scholars studying in Italian universities. He also was concerned with preserving the Eastern Orthodox religious tradition among his countrymen living in what he considered a materialistic milieu.
Margunios sought a theological compromise formula acceptable to both Latin and Greek churches for the disputed Filioque clause in the Latin version of the Nicene Creed. After his treatise on the subject, “On the Procession of the Holy Spirit,” appeared in 1591, he was suspected of wavering on Eastern Orthodox doctrine and was obliged to send a statement to Constantinople assuring the Byzantine council on doctrine that he had not deviated from Orthodoxy.
A notable accomplishment in the advancement of learning was Margunios’ collaboration with the Anglican classical scholar Sir Henry Savile in the 1613 standard edition of the complete works of St. John Chrysostom, the late 4th-century Greek church father. Savile publicly acknowledged that Margunios’ cooperation was decisive in producing the critical Greek text, an edition that continues to be definitive.
