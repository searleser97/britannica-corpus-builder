Mi-Sinai tune,   in the music of the Ashkenazic (Yiddish-vernacular) Jews, any of a group of melodically fixed chants for the liturgy of the High Holy Days and other festivals. Developed in the Rhineland in the 12th–15th centuries, they were held in such high esteem that they became known as Mi-Sinai (“from Mount Sinai”). Their texts, written during a period of repression, are often mystical or express longing for the Messiah.
Musically, the Mi-Sinai tunes are among the finest achievements of Jewish music. They represent a thorough integration into traditional Jewish music of elements borrowed from European music. Thus, there can be discerned in the melodies rhythmically and tonally modified fragments from compositions of the 14th-century French composer Guillaume de Machaut, the 15th-century Burgundians, German secular minnesinger song, French and German folk song, and Gregorian chant; these borrowed elements, however, can be discovered only on painstaking examination. The melodies also draw on a number of commonly recurring melismas (melodic fragments with several notes on one vowel) that had gained nonmusical connotations through strong associations with specific Hebrew texts.
