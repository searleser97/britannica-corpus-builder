Ambrose Reeves, in full Richard Ambrose Reeves,  (born December 6, 1899, Norwich, England—died December 23, 1980, Shoreham-by-Sea, East Sussex), Anglican prelate who was bishop of Johannesburg, South Africa (1949–61), and a strong opponent of apartheid.
Reeves was active in the Student Christian Movement (SCM) while an undergraduate at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, and he also attended the College of the Resurrection, Mirfield. His work as rector of bombed-out St. Nicholas Church in Liverpool (1942–49) marked him as an Anglo-Catholic who could cooperate with other religious traditions and thereby rebuild a Christian community. As bishop of Johannesburg he strove to build up parishes and missions and help Africans in an area of industrial change. He was so vigorously outspoken against apartheid and critical of the South African government, especially after the Sharpeville massacre of March 1960, that he was deported from the country and resigned his see. He was general secretary of the SCM (1962–65) and was named president of Britain’s Anti-Apartheid Movement in 1970.
