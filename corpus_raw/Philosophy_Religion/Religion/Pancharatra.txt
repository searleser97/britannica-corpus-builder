Pancharatra,  early Hindu religious movement whose members worshiped the deified sage Narayana (who came to be identified with Lord Vishnu) and, in merger with the Bhagavata sect, formed the earliest sectarian movement within Hinduism. The new group was a forerunner of modern Vaishnavism, or the worship of Vishnu.
The Pancharatras originated in the Himalayan region perhaps in the 3rd century bce. The groupâ€™s name is attributed to a five-day-long sacrifice (pancha-ratra) performed by Narayana by which he obtained superiority over all beings and became all beings.
The Pancharatra doctrine was first systematized by Shandilya (c. 100 ce?), who composed several devotional verses about the deity Narayana; that the Pancharatra system was also known in South India is evident from 2nd-century-ce inscriptions. By the 10th century the sect had acquired sufficient popularity to leave its influence on other groups, though criticized by Shankara and other orthodox figures as nonmonastic and non-Vedic.
