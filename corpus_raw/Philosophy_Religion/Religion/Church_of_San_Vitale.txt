Church of San Vitale, also called Basilica of San Vitale,  church in Ravenna, Italy, that was built in the 6th century and is considered a masterpiece of Byzantine achitecture. It is especially noted for the colourful mosaics of Christian iconography that decorate the interior walls and ceilings.
The church was begun by Bishop Ecclesius in 526 under the Ostrogothic queen Amalasuntha (died 535) and was consecrated in 547. It was dedicated to the martyr Vitalis, the patron saint of Ravenna. At the time, the city was the capital of the Western Roman Empire. The octagonal structure is made of marble and capped by a lofty terra-cotta dome. The celebrated mosaics were strongly influenced by similar work at Constantinople (Istanbul). They depict Old and New Testament figures as well as contemporary Byzantine rulers and Catholic ecclesiastics. Of particular note are the mosaics on the presbytery’s ceiling, which depict the Lamb of God amid plants and animals. In addition, the emperor Justinian (reigned 527–565) and his consort, Theodora, are featured in panels near the apse.
The Church of San Vitale and other Christian monuments in Ravenna were collectively designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1996.
