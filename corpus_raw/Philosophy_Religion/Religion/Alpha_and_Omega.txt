Alpha and Omega,   in Christianity, the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet, used to designate the comprehensiveness of God, implying that God includes all that can be. In the New Testament Revelation to John, the term is used as the self-designation of God and of Christ. The reference in Revelation likely had a Jewish origin, based on such Old Testament passages as Isa. 44:6 (“I am the first and the last”), and Ps. 90:2 (“from everlasting to everlasting thou art God”). In rabbinic literature, the word emet (“truth”), composed of the first and last letters of the Hebrew alphabet, is “the seal of God,” and in Judaic tradition it carries somewhat the same connotation as Alpha and Omega.
