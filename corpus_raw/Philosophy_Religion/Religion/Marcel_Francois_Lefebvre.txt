Marcel Lefebvre,  (born Nov. 29, 1905, Tourcoing, Fr.—died  March 25, 1991, Martigny, Switz.), ultraconservative Roman Catholic archbishop who opposed the liberalizing changes begun by the Second Vatican Council (1962–65) and who was excommunicated in 1988 for consecrating new traditionalist bishops without the approval of the Holy See in Rome. He created the bishops in order to perpetuate his crusade after his death.
Lefebvre studied at the Sacred Heart College in Tourcoing and at the French Seminary in Rome and was ordained a priest in 1929. After a brief assignment in Lille, Fr., he served in missionary posts in Gabon (1932–46) and Senegal (1947–62), becoming archbishop of Dakar, Senegal, in 1948. As a member of the preparatory commission (1960–62) for the Second Vatican Council, he helped frame traditionalist proposals that the convening bishops in the subsequent council sessions strongly rejected. The bishops substituted more liberal reforms, such as saying mass in the vernacular rather than in Latin, reconciling Roman Catholicism with other religions, and promoting the collegiality of the pope and the bishops in leading the church. Lefebvre came to denigrate such reforms as “heretical,” “anti-Christ,” and “satanic.”
From 1962 to 1968 Lefebvre was superior general of the Holy Ghost Fathers. In 1969 he founded the Priestly Confraternity of Saint Pius X in Fribourg, Switz. (the namesake, Pope Pius X, had been a staunch conservative), and in 1970 he established the society’s seminary at Ecône, a villa near Riddes in Valais canton, Switz., to train priests according to his traditionalist model. Soon the Vatican and Lefebvre were to exchange vigorous criticisms, and in 1975 the Vatican withdrew approval of the order. In 1976 Pope Paul VI suspended Lefebvre, forbidding him to carry out priestly and episcopal functions. Lefebvre not only defied Rome in continuing his priesthood but set about establishing regional headquarters in various countries for his variety of Roman Catholicism. Several negotiating efforts to avoid a schism failed; and on June 30, 1988, upon consecrating four traditionalist bishops at Ecône in defiance of Pope John Paul II’s orders, Lefebvre was excommunicated. His group, then numbering more than 60,000 followers, was deemed schismatic.
