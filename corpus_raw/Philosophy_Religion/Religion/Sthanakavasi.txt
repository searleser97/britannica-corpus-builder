Sthanakavasi, (Sanskrit: “meetinghouse-dweller”)  a modern subsect of the Shvetambara (“White-robed”) sect of Jainism, a religion of India. The group is also sometimes called the Dhundhia (Sanskrit: “searchers”).
The Sthanakavasi, whose name refers to the subsect’s preference for performing religious duties at a secular place such as a monks’ meetinghouse (sthanak) rather than at a temple, differs from the Shvetambara sect in its rejection of image worship and temple ritual. The subsect was founded in the 17th century by Lava of Surat, a member of an earlier non-image-worshipping sect called the Lumpaka, or Lonka Gaccha. Both groups based their belief on the argument that the Jain canon makes no mention of idol worship. The Sthanakavasis themselves gave rise to another group, the Terapanthi (“those who follow the path of the 13 precepts”), founded by Acharya Bhikshu in the 18th century.
