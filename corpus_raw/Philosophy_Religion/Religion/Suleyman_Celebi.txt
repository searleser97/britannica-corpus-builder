Süleyman Çelebi, also called Süleyman Of Bursa,  (born, Bursa, Ottoman Empire [now in Turkey]—died  1429, Bursa), one of the most famous early poets of Anatolia.
Süleyman appears to have been the son of an Ottoman minister, Ahmed Paşa, who served in the court of Sultan Murad I. Süleyman became a leader of the Khalwatīyah dervish order and then imam (religious leader) to the court of the Ottoman sultan Bayezid I (1389–1402). After Bayezid’s death, Süleyman took the position of imam in a mosque in Bursa.
Süleyman’s most famous and only surviving work is the great religious poem Mevlûd-i Nebi, or Mevlûd-i Peygamberi (“Hymn on the Prophet’s Nativity,” Eng. trans., 1943, reprint, 1957).
The Mevlûd, as it is more commonly called, tells the story of the Prophet Muḥammad’s birth, life, and death; his miracles; and his journey to heaven. Written in simple 15th-century Ottoman Turkish style, it is a work inspired with religious fervour and is often recited at religious ceremonies, particularly funerals in present Turkey. It is chanted during the celebrations of the Prophet’s birthday.
