Pērkons, (Latvian: “Thunderer”) Lithuanian Perkūnas, Old Prussian Perkunis,  sky deity of Baltic religion, renowned as the guardian of law and order and as a fertility god. The oak, as the tree most often struck by lightning, is sacred to him. Pērkons is related in functions and image to the Slavic Perun, Germanic Thor, and Greek Zeus.
Often depicted as a vigorous, bearded man holding an ax, Pērkons rides across the sky striking fire with his two-wheeled chariot and bringing rain. In the spring his lightning purifies the earth and stimulates plant growth. Pērkons also directs his thunderbolts against evil spirits and unjust men and even disciplines the gods. Lithuanian legend recounts that when Mėnuo, the moon god and husband of Saule, goddess of the Sun, committed adultery, Perkūnas punished his infidelity by cutting him to pieces.
According to ancient tradition, thunderbolts—“bullets of Pērkons,” found buried in the ground as flint or bronze celts—or any object or person struck by lightning could be used by mortals as protection against devils or as cures for toothache, fever, and fright. Probably the most popular of all Baltic gods, Perkūnas is often referred to in Lithuanian as dievaitis, an archaic diminutive of dievas (“god”).
