Mahāpuruṣa, (Sanskrit: “great man”, ) also called Śalākāpuruṣa,  in Hindu, Jaina, and Buddhist belief, an individual of extraordinary destiny, distinguished by certain physical traits or marks (lakṣanas). Such men are born to become either universal rulers (cakravartins) or great spiritual leaders (such as buddhas or the Jaina spiritual leaders, the Tirthankaras). In the case of Gautama Buddha, soothsayers were able to recognize the signs at his birth, although all did not fully appear until he achieved Enlightenment (the uṣṇīṣa, or protuberance on the top of the skull, was visible only after he became a buddha). The signs have frequently been depicted in representations of the Buddha or of the Jaina Tirthankaras.
Catalogs of the distinguishing marks differ slightly between the religious traditions. In Buddhism the lakṣanas are enumerated as 32 major marks and 80 minor marks. The major lakṣanas include: (1) the uṣṇīṣa, or protuberance on the top of the skull; (2) hair arranged in short twists, each curl turning from left to right; (3) the ūrṇā, a little ball or tuft of hair between the eyebrows; (4) 40 perfectly shaped, dazzling white teeth, equal in size; (5) a large, long tongue; (6) golden-tinged skin; (7) long arms that reach to the knees when the individual is standing upright; (8) webbed fingers and toes; (9) a thousand-spoked wheel on the sole of each foot.
Jainism honours 54 “great souls” (also called śalākāpuruṣas). They include the 24 Tirthankaras (“Ford-Makers”), 12 cakravartins (“world conquerors”), 9 vāsudevas (counterparts of the Hindu god Krishna), and 9 baladevas (counterparts of the Hindu god Balarāma). The birth of a great soul is always preceded by certain auspicious dreams seen by the mother. Some lists add 9 prati-vāsudevas (or enemies of vāsudevas), making a total of 63. The lives of the śalākāpuruṣas are the subject matter of the Jaina epic and Puranic texts.
