Geneva Catechism,  doctrinal confession prepared by John Calvin to instruct children in Reformed theology. Recognizing that his first catechism (1537) was too difficult for children, Calvin rewrote it. He arranged the Geneva Catechism (1542) in questions and answers in an effort to simplify doctrinal complexities.
The Geneva Catechism is primarily concerned with humans’ relationship to God. It is composed of five sections: (1) faith, with an exposition of the Apostles’ Creed, (2) the law (the Ten Commandments), (3) prayer, (4) the Word of God, and (5) the sacraments. Used principally in Geneva and Scotland, it was superseded by the Heidelberg and Westminster catechisms, both of which were indebted to Calvin’s work.
