Incense burner,  container, generally of bronze or pottery and fitted with a perforated lid, in which incense is burned. Although incense burners have been used in Europe, they have been far more widespread in the East.
In China during the Han dynasty (206 bce–220 ce), a type of vessel known as a hill censer was used. It consisted of a shallow circular pan, in the centre of which was an incense container with a pierced lid constructed as a three-dimensional representation of the Daoist Isles of the Blest. Incense burners of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) were made in two basic forms: a square vessel on four feet, fitted with two handles and a pierced lid, and a circular tripod vessel, also fitted with a perforated lid. If the original lids were lost, it was customary to replace them with wooden lids carved in imitation of the original metal piercing. In Japan in the 19th century a number of large bronze incense burners were made for export. Their decorative designs, often incorporating dragons, are distinguished by high relief, and the vessels were usually given artificial patinas. See also thurible.
