Christiern Pedersen,  (born c. 1480, Helsingør, Den.—died  Jan. 16, 1554, Helsingør), Danish humanist who was among the first to rediscover Denmark’s national literary and historical heritage and to encourage the development of a vernacular style in Danish literature.
Pedersen studied at Greifswald and took orders in 1505. In 1508 he went to Paris and there produced the first edition (now lost) of Saxo Grammaticus’ Gesta Danorum, under the title Historia danica (1514). He also edited Peder Laale’s proverbs and published a Latin-Danish lexicon. Returning to Denmark, Pedersen supported the Reformation and became secretary to Christian II, following him into exile in 1525. In Holland he translated, from the Vulgate, part of the New Testament (1529) and the Psalms (1531) into Danish and also adapted some of Luther’s tracts. In 1532 he set up as a printer at Malmö, publishing Danish versions of French romances and the legends of Charlemagne. He had a share in the Danish translation of the Bible published in 1550, which was based on Luther’s translation and which marked an important stage in the development of Danish literature as well as in the progress of the Reformation.
