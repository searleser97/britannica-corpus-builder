Legio Maria, (Latin: “Legion of Mary”)  Christian new religious movement and African independent church (AIC).
Legio Maria was founded in 1963 by two Roman Catholics of the Luo ethnic group in Kenya: Simeo Ondeto (died 1992), a catechist (religious teacher), and Gaundencia Aoko. Both claimed to have undergone prophetic experiences that invested them with divine authority and directed them to reject traditional magic and divine healers. Excommunicated for this, Ondeto and Aoko formed a new all-African church that offered free healing by prayer and the exorcism of evil spirits. In its first year of existence an estimated 90,000 fringe or nominal Catholics and non-Christians, mostly Luo, joined the church. Members called Ondeto “Baba Messiah” and considered him to be an incarnation of Jesus. After women were barred from the priesthood of Legio Maria in 1968, Aoko founded her own church, taking some of Legio Maria’s membership with her. Legio Maria regained ground in subsequent decades as it spread from the rural areas to the cities and eventually to neighbouring countries. In the first decade of the 21st century, Legio Maria was the largest AIC with origins in Roman Catholicism, claiming about three million followers.
A charismatic movement closely resembling Pentecostalism, Legio Maria emphasizes the gifts of the Holy Spirit and incorporates such practices as glossolalia (speaking in tongues) and exorcism into its services while retaining Catholic hierarchy and worship.  Its head is called “pope.” Legio Maria practices the Latin mass, though sermons are delivered in vernacular languages. Portraits of Ondeto and his mother are displayed on the altar next to representations of Jesus and the Virgin Mary. Legio Maria rejects Western and traditional medicines, alcohol, tobacco, and dancing. Although Legio Maria frowns on polygamy and bars polygamists from holding church offices, several members are polygamists.
