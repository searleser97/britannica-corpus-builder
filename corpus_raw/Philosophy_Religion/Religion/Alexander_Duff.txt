Alexander Duff,  (born April 26, 1806, Moulin, Perthshire, Scot.—died  Feb. 12, 1878, Edinburgh), the Church of Scotland’s first missionary to India, highly influential on later missionary endeavours through his promotion of higher education.
Duff was twice shipwrecked before reaching Calcutta (May 1830), where he opened an English language school for Hindus and Muslims, combining Bible studies with aspects of Western science that challenged local religious beliefs.
In 1844 Duff cofounded the Calcutta Review and served as editor from 1845 to 1849, after which time he returned to Scotland. In 1851 he was elected moderator of the Free Church assembly but returned to India in 1856, the year the Bengal army mutinied against the British colonial government. Condemnation of the government’s policy was voiced in The Indian Mutiny: Its Causes and Results (1858). Duff was offered the post of vice chancellor of the University of Calcutta in 1863 but declined because of poor health. He returned to Scotland, where in 1873 he was again appointed moderator of the Free Church assembly.
