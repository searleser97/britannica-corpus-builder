Apaturia,   Greek religious festival that was held annually in nearly all the Ionian towns. At Athens it took place in the month of Pyanopsion (October–November) and lasted three days, on which occasion the various phratries (clans) of Attica met to discuss their affairs. The name probably means the festival of “common relationship.” The most important day was probably the third, Koureotis, when children born since the last festival were presented by their fathers or guardians; after an oath had been taken as to their legitimacy, their names were inscribed in the register.
