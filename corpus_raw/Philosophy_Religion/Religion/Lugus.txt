Lugus, also called Lug, or Lugh,  (Celtic: “Lynx,” or “Light”?), in ancient Celtic religion, one of the major gods. He is one of the deities whom Julius Caesar identified with the Roman god Mercury (Greek: Hermes). His cult was widespread throughout the early Celtic world, and his name occurs as an element in many continental European and British place-names, such as Lyon, Laon, Leiden, and Carlisle (formerly Luguvallium, “Strong in the God Lugus”).
According to Irish tradition, Lug Lámfota (“Lug of the Long Arm”) was the sole survivor of triplet brothers all having the same name. At least three dedications to Lugus in plural form, Lugoues, are known from the European continent, and the Celtic affinity for trinitarian forms would suggest that three gods were likewise envisaged in these dedications. Lug’s son, or rebirth, according to Irish belief, was the great Ulster hero, Cú Chulainn (“Culann’s Dog”).
In Wales, as Lleu Llaw Gyffes (“Lleu of the Dexterous Hand”), he was also believed to have had a strange birth. His mother was the virgin goddess Aranrhod (“Silver Wheel”). When her uncle, the great magician Math, tested her virginity by means of a wand of chastity, she at once gave birth to a boy child, who was instantly carried off by his uncle Gwydion and reared by him. Aranrhod then sought repeatedly to destroy her son, but she was always prevented by Gwydion’s powerful magic; she was forced to give her son a name and provide him with arms; finally, as his mother had denied him a wife, Gwydion created a woman for him from flowers.
Lug was also known in Irish tradition as Samildánach (“Skilled in All the Arts”). The variety of his attributes and the extent to which his calendar festival Lugnasad on August 1 was celebrated in Celtic lands indicate that he was one of the most powerful and impressive of all the ancient Celtic deities.
