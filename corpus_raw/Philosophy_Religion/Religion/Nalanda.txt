Nalanda,  ancient university and Buddhist monastic centre southwest of Bihar Sharif in central Bihar state, northeastern India. Nalanda’s traditional history dates to the time of the Buddha (6th–5th centuries bce) and Mahavira, the founder of the Jaina religion. According to a later Tibetan source, Nagarjuna (the 2nd–3rd-century ce Buddhist philosopher) began his studies there. Extensive excavations carried out by the Archaeological Survey of India indicate, however, that the foundation of the monasteries belongs to the Gupta period (5th century ce). The powerful 7th-century ruler of Kanauj (Kannauj), Harshavardhana, is reported to have contributed to them. During his reign the Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang stayed at Nalanda for some time and left a clear account of the subjects studied there and of the general features of the community. Yijing, another Chinese pilgrim a generation later, also provided a minute account of the life of the monks. Nalanda continued to flourish as a centre of learning under the Pala dynasty (8th–12th centuries), and it became a centre of religious sculpture in stone and bronze. Nalanda was probably sacked during Muslim raids in Bihar (c. 1200) and never recovered.
According to pilgrims’ accounts, from Gupta times the monasteries of Nalanda were surrounded by a high wall. The excavations revealed a row of 10 monasteries of the traditional Indian design—oblong brick structures with cells opening onto four sides of a courtyard, with a main entrance on one side and a shrine facing the entrance across the courtyard. In front of the monasteries stood a row of larger shrines, or stupas, in brick and plaster. The entire complex is referred to on seals discovered there as Mahavihara (“Great Monastery”). A museum at Nalanda houses many of the treasures found in the excavations. In 2016 the ruins were designated a UNESCO World Heritage site.
