Salmān al-Fārisī,  (flourished  7th century, born near Eṣfahān, Iran), popular figure in Muslim legend and a national hero of Iran. He was a companion of the Prophet Muhammad.
While still a boy he became a Christian, left his father’s house, and began a long religious quest. He traveled to Syria and then to central Arabia, seeking the prophet who, he was told, would revive the religion of Abraham. On the way he was sold into slavery. In Medina he met Muhammad, with whose aid he purchased his freedom. The most important event connected with Salmān is the Battle of the Ditch in 627. According to tradition, when the Meccans came to besiege Muhammad in Medina, it was Salmān who suggested that, instead of the usual practice of the besieged sallying out to meet their opponents, a ditch be dug across the city’s approaches as a form of protection. This was an innovation in Arabian warfare and was instrumental in Muhammad’s successful defense.
Little is known of Salmān al-Fārisī as a historical figure. His fame is due largely to his nationality—he was a prototype of the Persians who were converted to Islam and who played a central role in the course of Muslim history. Salmān also has been important in Muslim religious thought. The moderates of the Shīʿite sect gave him special respect because of his nearness to the Prophet, and the extreme Shīʿites count him as one of the divine emanations recognized by their theology.
