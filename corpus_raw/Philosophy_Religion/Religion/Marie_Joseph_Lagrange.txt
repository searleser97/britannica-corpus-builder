Marie-Joseph Lagrange,  (born March 7, 1855, Bourg-en-Bresse, Fr.—died  March 10, 1938, Marseille), French theologian and outstanding Roman Catholic biblical scholar.
Lagrange became a Dominican in 1879 and was ordained in 1883. After teaching church history at Toulouse (1884–88), he studied Oriental languages at the University of Vienna before his order sent him to Jerusalem in 1890 to establish the School of Biblical Studies. There he also founded (1892) a journal, the Revue Biblique (“Biblical Review”), and in 1903 began a series of scholarly commentaries on the Bible, the Études bibliques (“Biblical Studies”), to which he contributed three volumes: on the historical method of Old Testament criticism, on the Book of Judges, and on the Semitic religions.
Europe was at that time experiencing the effects of papally censured modernism, an intellectual movement that sought to reinterpret traditional Roman Catholic teaching. Although Lagrange welcomed the papal antimodernist pronouncements, his commentary on Genesis (1906) so clearly represented the modernist viewpoint that he was subjected to strong criticism. In 1912 opposition to some of his methods caused his superiors to recall him to France. He was later sent back to Jerusalem, where he taught, except during World War I, until his death.
Lagrange wrote important commentaries for the Études on Mark (1911), Romans (1916), Galatians (1918), Luke (1921), Matthew (1923), and John (1925). His chief books include Le Judaïsme avant Jésus-Christ (1931; “Judaism Before Jesus Christ”), Histoire ancienne du canon du Nouveau Testament (1933; “Ancient History of the Canon of the New Testament”), and Critique textuelle—La Critique rationelle (1935; “Textual Criticism—The Rational Criticism”), considered to be his masterpiece.
