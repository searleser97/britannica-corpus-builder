Adonijah,   in the Old Testament, the fourth son of David, the natural heir to the throne. David’s favourite wife, Bathsheba, organized an intrigue in favour of her son Solomon. Shortly after his accession, Solomon had Adonijah put to death on the ground that, by seeking to marry David’s concubine Abishag, he was aiming at the crown (I Kings 1 ff.).
