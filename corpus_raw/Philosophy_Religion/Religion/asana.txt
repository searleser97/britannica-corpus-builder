Asana, (Sanksrit: “sitting posture,” “seat”)  in the Yoga system of Indian philosophy, an immobile bodily posture that a person assumes in an attempt to isolate the mind by freeing it from attention to bodily functions. It is the third of the eight prescribed stages intended to lead the aspirant to samadhi, the trancelike state of perfect concentration. Once the practitioner is able with ease to maintain a rigid, essentially unnatural posture, he has in a sense “concentrated” his body (the antithesis of its normal dispersed state, that of infinite mobility). As many as 32 or more asanas have been enumerated, of which perhaps the most common is the padmasana (“lotus posture”).
In the visual arts of India, asana refers to the posture of a seated deity or figure or to the seat or throne sat upon.
