Tonalpohualli,  260-day sacred almanac of many ancient Mesoamerican cultures, including the Maya, Mixtec, and Aztec. Used as early as the pre-Classic period (before c. ad 100) in Monte Albán (Oaxaca) and even earlier in the Veracruz (Olmec) culture, the almanac set the date for certain rituals and was a means of divination. It is a cycle of days resulting when the numbers 1 to 13 are juxtaposed with 20 day names: 1 Alligator, 2 Wind…13 Reed, 1 Jaguar, etc. Each combination of name and number occurs once in 260 (20 × 13) days. The cycle is still observed in the 20th century by the Mixe (Oaxaca) and the Maya.
