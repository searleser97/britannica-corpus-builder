Gorboduc,  a mythical king of ancient Britain, known primarily as the subject of the earliest English tragic play in blank verse, Gorboduc, by Thomas Norton and Thomas Sackville, which was first performed in 1561.
Geoffrey of Monmouth’s Historia regum Britanniae (1135–38; History of the Kings of Britain) relates the dispute between Gorboduc’s two sons, Ferrex and Porrex, over who would succeed him as king. In Norton and Sackville’s play, which is derived from Geoffrey’s account, Gorboduc is a good ruler who gives his kingdom away during his lifetime to his sons. The sons quarrel, and Porrex, the younger, kills Ferrex. Gorboduc’s queen avenges the death of her more-beloved older son by murdering Porrex. Gorboduc and his queen are murdered in turn by their horrified former subjects.
