Kobold,   in German folklore, mischievous household spirit who usually helps with chores and gives other valuable services but who often hides household and farm tools or kicks over stooping persons. He is temperamental and becomes outraged when he is not properly fed. He sometimes sings to children.
Some kobolds have been called the spirits of caves and mines. Still others have specific names, such as HÃ¶deken, who frightens unfaithful wives, and Goldemar, who sees the secret sins of the clergy. See also poltergeist.
