Gemilut ḥesed, (Hebrew: “bestowing kindness”, ) also called Gemilut Ḥasadim,  (“bestowing kindnesses”), in Judaism, an attribute of God said to be imitated by those who in any of countless ways show personal kindness toward others. A Jew who does not manifest sensitive concern for others is considered no better than an atheist, regardless of his knowledge of the Torah. Although emphasis is on personal service rather than on money, many gemilut ḥesed societies have been organized to lend money without interest to those temporarily in need, an act of kindness considered superior to almsgiving because a loan does not humiliate the recipient.
