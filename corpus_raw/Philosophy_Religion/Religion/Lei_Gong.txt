Lei Gong, (Chinese: “Duke of Thunder”) Wade-Giles romanization Lei Kung, also called Lei Shen (“Thunder God”),  Chinese Daoist deity who, when so ordered by heaven, punishes both earthly mortals guilty of secret crimes and evil spirits who have used their knowledge of Daoism to harm human beings. Lei Gong carries a drum and mallet to produce thunder and a chisel to punish evildoers.
Lei Gong is depicted as a fearsome creature with claws, bat wings, and a blue body and wears only a loincloth. Temples dedicated to him are rare, but some persons do him special honour in the hope that he will take revenge on their personal enemies.
Lei Gong’s specialty is thunder, but he has assistants capable of producing other types of heavenly phenomena. Dian Mu (“Mother of Lightning”), for example, uses flashing mirrors to send bolts of lightning across the sky. Yun Tong (“Cloud Youth”) whips up clouds, and Yuzi (“Rain Master”) causes downpours by dipping his sword into a pot. Roaring winds rush forth from a type of goatskin bag manipulated by Feng Bo (“Earl of Wind”), who was later replaced by Feng Popo (“Madame Wind”). She rides a tiger among the clouds.
