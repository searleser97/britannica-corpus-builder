Shaktism,  worship of the Hindu goddess Shakti (Sanskrit: “Power” or “Energy”). Shaktism is, together with Vaishnavism and Shaivism, one of the major forms of modern Hinduism and is especially popular in Bengal and Assam. Shakti is conceived of either as the paramount goddess or as the consort of a male deity, generally Shiva.
Many Hindus worship Shakti as the divine mother who calls for absolute surrender. Yogis regard Shakti as the power, lying dormant within the body as a coiled serpent (kundalini), that must be aroused and realized to reach spiritual liberation. Shaktism is an essential part of Hindu Tantra, a system of practices involving the worship of the goddess and designed to empower and release both mind and body.
In popular worship, the goddess Shakti is known by many names; Hindus regard all female deities as her different manifestations and may refer to her simply as Devi (Goddess). In her beneficent aspect she is known variously as Uma, Parvati, and Ambika. In her fierce, destructive aspect she is represented as the black Kali, the demon-destroying Durga, and the goddess of smallpox, Shitala. The goddess is also worshipped as the gracious Lakshmi, who is the consort of Vishnu.
