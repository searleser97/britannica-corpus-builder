Daphnis,   legendary hero of the shepherds of Sicily and the reputed inventor of bucolic poetry. According to tradition, Daphnis was the son of Hermes and a Sicilian nymph and was found by shepherds in a grove of laurels (Greek daphnē). He later won the affection of a nymph, who swore him to eternal fidelity, or perhaps chastity. A king’s daughter got him drunk and seduced him, so the nymph blinded him. Daphnis tried to console himself by playing the flute and singing shepherds’ songs, but he soon died or was taken up to heaven by Hermes. According to Theocritus (Idyll 1), Daphnis offended Eros and Aphrodite and, in return, was smitten with unrequited love; he died, although Aphrodite, moved by compassion, unsuccessfully attempted to save him.
