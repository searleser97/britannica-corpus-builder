Samuel ha-Nagid, Arabic Ismail Ibn Nagrelʿa,  (born 993, Córdoba, Spain—died  1055/56, Granada), Talmudic scholar, grammarian, philologist, poet, warrior, and statesman who for two decades was the power behind the throne of the caliphate of Granada.
As a youth Samuel received a thorough education in all branches of Jewish and Islāmic knowledge and mastered Arabic calligraphy, a rare achievement among Jews. When Córdoba was sacked in 1013 by the Berbers, a north African people believing in Islām, Samuel fled to Málaga, at that time part of the Muslim kingdom of Granada.
Samuel’s unusual linguistic and calligraphic skills caught the attention of the Granadan vizier, who employed him as his private secretary. He soon became an invaluable political adviser to the vizier, who, at his death, commended Samuel to the caliph Ḥabbūs. The caliph made Samuel the new vizier, and as such he assumed direction of Granada’s diplomatic and military affairs.
Ḥabbūs died in 1037. Although his elder, pleasure-loving son then assumed the throne, Samuel was the caliph in fact if not in actuality. He steered Granada through years of continuous warfare and actively participated in all major campaigns. His influence became so great that he was even able to arrange for his son Joseph to succeed him as vizier.
Samuel was also nagid (Hebrew: “chief ”) of Granadan Jewry. As such, he appointed all the judges and headed the Talmudic academy. He is generally believed to be the author of Mevo ha-Talmud (“Introduction to the Talmud”), a long-lived Talmudic manual. He also wrote a concordance to the Bible, encouraged learning in all fields, and became a respected, even revered figure among both Arabs and Jews.
