Yudi, (Chinese: Jade Emperor) Wade-Giles romanization Yü Ti, also called Yuhuang (Jade August One),  in Chinese religion, the most revered and popular of Chinese Daoist deities. In the official Daoist pantheon, he is an impassive sage-deity, but he is popularly viewed as a celestial sovereign who guides human affairs and rules an enormous heavenly bureaucracy analogous to the Chinese Empire.
The worship of Yudi was officially sanctioned by the Daoist emperors of the Song dynasty (960–1279 ce), who renamed him Yuhuang Shangdi (Jade August Supreme Lord) and accorded him a status equivalent to that of the Confucian supreme power. Yudi is usually depicted on a throne wearing the imperial dragon-embroidered robes and beaded bonnet, holding a jade ceremonial tablet.
