Catholic Worker Movement,  Roman Catholic lay movement in the United States and Canada, emphasizing personal reform, radical agrarianism, absolute pacifism, and the personal practice of the principles in Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount. The movement was founded in 1933 by Dorothy Day (1897–1980) at the instigation of Peter Maurin (1877–1949), a self-described peasant-philosopher and Christian radical. Maurin and Day’s program provided for round-table discussions of Christian social thought, the opening of houses of hospitality for all in need, and the establishment of independent farming communes.
The movement gained traction from Day and Maurin’s monthly newspaper, the Catholic Worker, through which they advanced the Catholic notion of the “preferential option for the poor” and various other Catholic social teachings. A group that gathered in New York City under Day’s leadership put the program into action with the creation of houses of hospitality where movement members lived in the community with the homeless and needy. Their example was followed elsewhere in the United States and Canada by local groups, each of which operated independently. Before World War II there were 35 of these groups, maintaining houses of hospitality and farming communes, scattered from Vermont to California. During the war the Catholic Worker maintained a strict pacifist position, but many young persons associated with the movement entered the armed services, and most of the houses of hospitality went out of existence. The movement never regained its prewar influence but did survive as a vital force in the Roman Catholic Church. Over 200 autonomous communities associated with movement existed in the early 21st century, though they were more or less overtly Catholic in their activities and were not considered to be official organs of the church.
