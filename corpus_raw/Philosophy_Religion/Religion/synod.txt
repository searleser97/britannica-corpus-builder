Synod,  (from Greek synodos, “assembly”), in the Christian church, a local or provincial assembly of bishops and other church officials meeting to resolve questions of discipline or administration.
The earliest synods can be traced to meetings held by bishops from various regions in the middle of the 2nd century. Such synods have convened throughout the history of Christianity. A synod of bishops from the worldwide Roman Catholic Church meets in Rome at regular but infrequent intervals for the purpose of discussing matters of vital church interest, in an advisory capacity to the pope.
In some Protestant churches, the term synod has come to signify an organizational unit, as in the Presbyterian and Reformed traditions, where a synod consists of a number of presbyteries. In the Lutheran church in the United States, synod is used as part of the name of a national organizational body, such as Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod. Individual congregations group into synods.
The actions taken by individual synods sometimes have had lasting significance. In the Synod of Dort (1618–19), the Dutch Reformed Church dealt with Arminianism and sponsored many reforms aimed at personal religious renewal.
