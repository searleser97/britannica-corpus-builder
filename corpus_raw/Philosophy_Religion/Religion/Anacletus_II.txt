Anacletus (II), original name Pietro Pierleoni,  (born, Rome [Italy]—died Jan. 25, 1138, Rome), antipope from 1130 to 1138 whose claims to the papacy against Pope Innocent II are still supported by some scholars. After study in Paris, he became a monk at Cluny and was made cardinal at Rome in 1116 by Pope Paschal II. In 1118 he accompanied Pope Gelasius II, who fled to France from the persecuting Frangipani, an influential Roman family.
After the death of Pope Honorius II in 1130, the college of cardinals was divided over his successor. A majority of cardinals elected Pietro as successor with the name of Anacletus II, while a minority elected Cardinal Gregorio Papareschi (Innocent II) as successor. The claimants were both consecrated on February 23, leading to a serious schism. Anacletus, backed by most Romans and by the Frangipani, forced Innocent to flee from Rome to France, where he was supported by Abbot St. Bernard of Clairvaux, who attacked Anacletus’ Jewish ancestry. Although Anacletus was allied with the ambitious and powerful Roger II after investing him as king of Sicily (1130), Innocent’s supporters, including the Holy Roman emperor Lothar II and the Byzantine emperor John II Comnenus, were overwhelming.
The Council (1130) of Étampes, France, convoked by King Louis VI the Fat to decide the legitimacy of the papal succession, chose Innocent. In 1132 Lothar, accompanied by Innocent and Bernard, led a German army into Italy and, by early summer, occupied all Rome except that section held by the Anacletans, who, upon Lothar’s departure, again forced Innocent out of Rome. He fled to Pisa, where in 1134 he held a council that excommunicated Anacletus. Lothar’s second expedition (1136–37) expelled Roger from southern Italy. Anacletus, with little remaining support, died amid the aftermath of this crisis. In 1139 the second Lateran Council convoked by Innocent ended the schism, though opinion remained divided.
