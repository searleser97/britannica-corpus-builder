Mañjuśrī,   in Mahāyāna Buddhism, the bodhisattva (“Buddha-to-be”) personifying supreme wisdom. His name in Sanskrit means “gentle, or sweet, glory”; he is also known as Mãnjughoṣa (“Sweet Voice”) and Vāgīśvara (“Lord of Speech”). In China he is called Wen-shu Shih-li, in Japan Monju, and in Tibet ’Jam-dpal.
Although sutras (Buddhist scriptures) were composed in his honour by at least ad 250, he does not seem to have been represented in Buddhist art before ad 400. He is most commonly shown wearing princely ornaments, his right hand holding aloft the sword of wisdom to cleave the clouds of ignorance and his left holding a palm-leaf manuscript of the Prajñāpāramitā. He is sometimes depicted seated on a lion or on a blue lotus; and in paintings his skin is usually yellow in colour.
His cult spread widely in China in the 8th century, and Mount Wu-t’ai in Shansi province, which is dedicated to him, is covered with his temples. Though he is usually considered a celestial bodhisattva, some traditions endow him with a human history. He is said to manifest himself in many ways—in dreams; as a pilgrim on his sacred mountain; as an incarnation of the monk Vairocana, who introduced Buddhism into Khotan; as the Tibetan reformer Atīśa; and as the emperor of China.
