Veralden-radien, also called Veralden-olmai,   (Sami: “Ruler of the World”), the deity believed by the Sami (Lapps) to be closest to the starry heaven. Because the deity is associated with mailmen stytto, the pillar supporting the heavens, he is also responsible for the continued maintenance of life and is considered a fertility god. Veralden-radien is believed to support all growth. The goddess of childbirth, Madderakka, receives the souls of unborn children from him, while he takes the souls of the departed down to yabme-aimo, the Sami realm of the dead. Veralden-radien was also the object of a phallic cult; each autumn a bull reindeer was traditionally sacrificed to him, then its genitalia were tied around his statue and the blood smeared over the statue.
The worship of Veralden-radien has many Scandinavian features, which has led scholars to look for the god’s origin among the Germanic peoples. He is often mentioned in connection with the Swedish deity Frey, a fertility god, and the Saxon world-supporting pillar Irminsul, which may have influenced some of the mythological concepts of the Sami.
