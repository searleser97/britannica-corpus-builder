Visuddhimagga, (Pali: “Path to Purification”)  encyclopedic and masterful summary and exposition of the teaching of the Mahavihara school of Theravada Buddhism. It was written during the reign of the Sri Lankan king Mahanama in the 5th century ce by the great Buddhist commentator Buddhaghosa. Along with two other notable counterparts, Dhammapala and Buddhadatta, Buddhagosa wrote new commentaries on Theravada doctrine in Pali, based on older Sinhalese commentaries that dated from the early centuries ce. The Visuddhimagga is perhaps the most famous of Buddhagosa’s considerable literary output. It organizes its material broadly under three headings: sila (morals), samadhi (concentration), and panna (wisdom), but it also comments on and explains a wide range of details of Buddhist doctrine through the use of narrative and by means of direct quotation from and explanation of the canonical texts of the Tipitaka, presenting Theravada doctrines as a systematic whole. In addition, the Visuddhimagga contains a detailed description of Buddhist meditative techniques and can be regarded as a general reference work on Theravada doctrine.
