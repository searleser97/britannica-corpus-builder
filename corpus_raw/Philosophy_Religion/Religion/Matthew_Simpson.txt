Matthew Simpson,  (born June 21, 1811, Cadiz, Ohio, U.S.—died  June 18, 1884, Philadelphia, Pa.), best known and most influential Methodist leader in the United States during the second half of the 19th century.
Simpson had little formal education but taught himself basic school subjects, foreign languages, printing, and law. For three years he studied medicine under a local physician and then started his own practice. He had always been active in religious work, however, and in the 1830s decided to devote himself to the Methodist ministry. Within a few years he was recognized as an extraordinary preacher. In 1839 he became president of Indiana Asbury University (now DePauw) in Greencastle, where he spent nine years developing the school into a leading Midwestern educational institution.
In 1848 the Methodist General Conference elected Simpson editor of its magazine Western Christian Advocate. An ardent opponent of slavery, Simpson wrote powerful editorials and delivered persuasive speeches on the subject. In 1852 he was elected bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church, and he used his position and his oratorical abilities to galvanize Northern patriotism before and during the Civil War. A close associate of top Republican Party officials, Simpson was chosen to deliver the eulogy at Abraham Lincoln’s burial in Springfield, Ill.
During the last two decades of his life, Simpson traveled throughout the country and the world. His fame spread well beyond the boundaries of the United States and the Methodist church. He also found time to write and edit several books, including A Hundred Years of Methodism (1876) and Cyclopaedia of Methodism (1878).
