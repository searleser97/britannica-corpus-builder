Ruy López de Segura,  (flourished  1560), Spanish priest, first modern Chess writer and analyst, and developer (though not inventor) of the Ruy López opening, which is still one of the most popular in Chess. It begins with these moves: (1) P-K4, P-K4; (2) Nt-KB3, Nt-QB3; (3) B-N5. López came from Zafra in Estremadura and became a favourite of King Philip II, who presented him with a gold Rook on a chain to be worn around his neck. He travelled to Italy in 1560 and 1573, defeating all players, but lost to Leonardo da Cutre of Italy in Spain in 1575.
López published the first manual of Chess instruction, his Libro de la invención liberal y arte del juego del Axedrez (“Book of the Liberal Invention and Art of Playing Chess”; 1561).
