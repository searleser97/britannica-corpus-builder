Antonio Brucioli,  (born 1495, Florence [Italy]—died  1566, Venice), Italian Humanist whose controversial translation of the Bible led to his being tried three times by the Inquisition on charges of Lutheranism.
After involvement in a plot against Cardinal Giulio de’ Medici (later Pope Clement VII) in 1522, Brucioli fled to Lyon. In 1527, after the fall of the Medici, he returned to Florence and wrote against ecclesiastical abuses. Accused of Lutheranism and exiled, he went to Venice, where he translated the Bible into Italian (1532); he followed the Latin versions of the Dutch Renaissance Humanist Erasmus for the New Testament and of the Italian Dominican Hebrew scholar Santes Pagninus for the Old Testament. Brucioli’s translation was destined, with some alterations, to become the Bible for Italian Protestants.
Brucioli’s expression of Protestant doctrines in the dedication and in his commentaries (7 vol., 1542–46) led to his call before the Inquisition. After the first prosecution in 1548 he was fined and banished to Ferrara. The second in 1555 ordered him to abjure, subjected him to penitence, and required him to compose a retraction. When he failed to retract, the third prosecution (1558–59) sentenced him to imprisonment.
In addition to his translation of the Bible, Brucioli wrote philosophical dialogues and a translation of the Natural History of Pliny the Elder.
