Ibn Kathīr, in full ʿImād al-Dīn Ismāʿīl ibn ʿUmar ibn Kathīr,  (born c. 1300, Bosra, Syria—died February 1373, Damascus, Syria), Muslim theologian and historian who became one of the leading intellectual figures of 14th-century Syria.
Ibn Kathīr was educated in Damascus and upon completion of his studies obtained his first official appointment in 1341, when he joined an inquisitorial commission formed to determine certain questions of heresy. Thereafter he received various semiofficial appointments, culminating in June/July 1366 with a professorial position at the Great Mosque of Damascus.
As a scholar, Ibn Kathīr is best remembered for his 14-volume history of Islam, Al-Bidāyah wa al-nihāyah (“The Beginning and the End”), a work that utilized nearly all the available sources and formed the basis of a number of writings by later historians. Ibn Kathīr was also a noted student of Hadith (the transmitted chain of sayings traced back to the Prophet Muhammad); his Kitāb al-jāmiʿ is an alphabetical listing of the Companions of the Prophet and the sayings that each transmitted, thus reconstructing the chain of authority for each hadith.
