Jane Leade, in full Jane Ward Leade, Leade also spelled Lead,  (born March 1624—died Aug. 19, 1704), English mystic and proponent of Universalist Christianity. Leade’s religious views were based on the thought of the German philosopher and mystic Jakob Böhme (1575–1624) and on her own visions and dreams. In 1681 Leade organized and became the visionary for a Philadelphian Society (a mid-17th-century English movement promoting esoteric Christianity) in London. She affirmed universal restoration, the ultimate reconciliation to God of all human beings, the devil, and his angels. Johann Wilhelm Petersen, a German-born Philadelphian and Pietist, gave her views scriptural foundations in his Mystery of the Restitution of All Things (1700–10).
