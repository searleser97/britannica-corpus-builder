Hylas,   in ancient Greek legend, son of Theiodamas (king of the Dryopians in Thessaly), favourite and companion of Heracles on the Argonautic expedition. Having gone ashore at Cios in Mysia to fetch water, he was dragged down by the nymphs of the spring in which he dipped his pitcher. Heracles sought him in vain; afterward, in memory of Heraclesâ€™ threat to ravage the land if Hylas was not found, the inhabitants of Cios each year on a stated day roamed the mountains, shouting aloud for Hylas. The story was a favourite of Hellenistic Greek poets, such as Apollonius of Rhodes, Theocritus, and Nicander, and was also told by the Latin elegist Propertius.
