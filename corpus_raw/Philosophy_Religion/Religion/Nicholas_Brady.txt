Nicholas Brady,  (born Oct. 28, 1659, Bandon, County Cork, Ire.—died  May 20, 1726, Richmond, Surrey, Eng.), Anglican clergyman and poet, author, with Nahum Tate, of a well-known metrical version of the Psalms.
Brady graduated from Trinity College, Dublin, and became prebendary of Cork. In 1690, he was able to prevent the burning of the town of Bandon, after James II had given orders for its destruction in his attempt to regain his crown. Brady soon afterward settled in London, where he held the livings of Clapham and Richmond.
Brady and Tate’s New Version of the Psalms was licensed in 1696 and largely displaced the old version of T. Sternhold and J. Hopkins. Among Brady’s other works was a blank-verse translation of Virgil’s Aeneid (1726).
