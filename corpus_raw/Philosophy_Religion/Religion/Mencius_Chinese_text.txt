Mencius, Chinese (Pinyin) Mengzi or (Wade-Giles romanization) Meng-tzu,  Confucian text, named for its author, that earned for the 4th-century-bce philosopher the title ya sheng (“second sage”). Though the book was not generally recognized as a classic until the 12th century, a doctoral chair was established as early as the 2nd century bce to teach the Mencius. When Zhu Xi, a great Neo-Confucian philosopher, published the Mencius together with three other Confucian texts in 1190, he created the classic known as Si shu (“Four Books”).
The book records the doings and sayings of the author and contains statements on the innate goodness of human nature. It also addresses the proper concerns of government and maintains that the welfare of the common people should come before every other consideration.
