Manto, (Greek: “Prophetess”)  in Greek legend, the daughter and assistant of the Theban prophet Tiresias. After the sack of Thebes by the Epigoni (the sons of the seven champions who fought against Thebes), she was dedicated to Apollo at his oracular shrine of Delphi as the fairest of the spoil. Fulfilling an utterance of the oracle, she married Rhacius the Cretan and founded in Ionia the famous Apolline oracle centre of Claros. Her son was the seer Mopsus. In Euripides’ last tragedy, Alcmaeon, however, she bears two sons to Alcmaeon, leader of the Epigoni.
