Elizabeth Barton, byname Nun Of Kent, or Holy Maid Of Kent,  (born c. 1506, Kent, Eng.—died  April 21, 1534, London), English ecstatic whose outspoken prophecies aroused public opinion over the matrimonial policy of King Henry VIII and led to her execution.
A domestic servant on the estate of William Warham, archbishop of Canterbury, she fell ill and about 1525 began to experience trances and to utter prophecies. Her fame spread, gaining for her a group of devotees, both clerical and lay. But her prophecies grew less mystical and more precise, and she began to threaten Henry VIII with dire consequences if he did not drop the projected annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon and abandon Anne Boleyn. On one occasion she admonished the king in person.
After Henry’s marriage to Anne, Elizabeth Barton’s utterances approached the treasonable, and the new archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Cranmer, began an investigation. Arrested and examined, she finally confessed to having feigned her trances and pretended her inspiration. She was condemned by Parliament and executed at Tyburn, outside London. It is not certain, however, that her confession—although extracted without torture—was the result of anything but confusion and fear, for she had no education and little intellect. If she was more a hysteric than a saint, it is probable that she was, in the main, sincere, more deluded than deluding.
