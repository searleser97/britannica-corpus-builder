Saint Fulgentius of Ruspe,  (born c. 467, Telepte, North Africa—died January 1, 533, Ruspe; feast day January 1), African bishop of Ruspe and theological writer who defended orthodoxy in 6th-century Africa against Arianism (q.v.). He also wrote polemics against Semi-Pelagianism (q.v.), the doctrine condemned at the Council of Orange (529).
Fulgentius became a monk, residing successively in Africa, Sicily, and Rome, then accepted the African bishopric of Ruspe on the Mediterranean coast (507). In 508 the Vandal king Thrasimund, a supporter of Arian beliefs, exiled 60 orthodox African bishops, who settled in Sardinia with Fulgentius as their leader and spokesman. Thrasimund recalled Fulgentius (515), but because of his orthodoxy, Fulgentius was exiled again (517–523). Thrasimund’s successor, Hilderich, allowed Fulgentius to return to Africa.
Eight of the numerous, essentially polemical writings ascribed to him elaborating orthodox views are known to be authentic. He was such a fervent disciple of St. Augustine that he has been called the “abbreviated Augustine.”
