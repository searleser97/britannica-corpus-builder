Derekh Eretz, also spelled Derekh Ereẓ,   (Hebrew: “correct conduct,” or “way of the land”), in Judaism, the decorum, dignified behaviour, and gentlemanly conduct that should characterize a Jew at all times. Rabbinic scholars have applied the notion, for example, to all aspects of family life and marriage, to the qualities expected of a scholar, and to relationships between friends. Derekh Eretz applies also to one’s manner of speaking, of eating, and of dressing and imposes on everyone the obligation of supporting himself so that others will not be unduly burdened. Derekh Eretz manifests itself in politeness toward others, whoever they be, and in genuine concern for their welfare. For Jews, Derekh Eretz is not only postulated in the Torah (the Law); without it, the Torah itself is rendered sterile. Two independent treatises have been written on the subject, both appended to the Babylonian Talmud: Derekh Eretz Rabba (“the Great”) and Derekh Eretz Zuṭaʾ (“the Minor”).
