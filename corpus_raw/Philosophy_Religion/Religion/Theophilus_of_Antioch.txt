Theophilus Of Antioch,  (born, near Tigris and Euphrates rivers, modern Iraqâ€”died  April 180, Antioch, modern Antakya, Tur.), Syrian saint, sixth bishop of Antioch, and Christian apologist.
Educated in the Greek tradition, Theophilus became a Christian as an adult, after extended deliberation, and by 170 was elected bishop of Antioch. His sole surviving work consists of three apologetic tracts To Autolycus, a pagan friend whose derision of the Christian faith prompted the defense.
His multifaceted literary activity, often rhetorical, was at first popular among Christian theologians, but by the 5th century it was largely forgotten.
