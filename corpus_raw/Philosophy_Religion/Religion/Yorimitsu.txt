Yorimitsu, also called Raikō,  one of the most popular of the legendary Japanese warrior heroes and a member of the martial Minamoto clan. In his exploits he is always accompanied by four trusty lieutenants. One adventure concerns his vanquishing the boy-faced giant Shuten-dōji (“Drunkard Boy”), who lived on human blood and who together with his repulsive retainers terrorized the countryside around his stronghold on Ōye-yama. To gain admittance to the stronghold, Yorimitsu and his companions disguised themselves as mountain priests. They first befuddled the creatures with a magic drink, then threw off their priestly robes to reveal themselves as warriors. Shuten-dōji’s severed head continued to attack Yorimitsu even after the giant’s death, but the Minamoto warriors eventually triumphed.
