African Greek Orthodox Church,   a religious movement in East Africa that represents a prolonged search for a Christianity more African and, its adherents say, more authentic than the denominational mission forms transplanted from overseas. It began when an Anglican in Uganda, Reuben Spartas, heard of the independent, all-black African Orthodox Church in the United States and founded his own African Orthodox Church in 1929. In 1932 he secured ordination by the U.S. churchâ€™s archbishop from South Africa, whose episcopal orders traced to the ancient Syrian Jacobite (Monophysite) Church of India. After discovering that the U.S. body was heterodox, the African Church added the term Greek and from 1933 developed an affiliation with the Alexandrian patriarchate of the Greek Orthodox church that culminated in its coming under the control of the first Greek missionary archbishop for East Africa in 1959. Also included were similar but larger churches that had arisen in central and western Kenya.
In 1966 tensions arising from missionary paternalism, inadequate material assistance, and young Greek-trained priests who were not particularly African-oriented led Spartas and his followers into secession. The new group, the African Orthodox Autonomous Church South of the Sahara (with some 7,000 members in Uganda), made unsuccessful approaches to other Greek patriarchates. These East African churches have asserted their African autonomy, shared in nationalist political activities, and accommodated to African customs (such as polygamy, ritual purificatory circumcision of females, and divination). At the same time, their vernacular versions of the Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom, use of vestments and icons, and identification with Eastern Orthodoxy represent a search for connection with the primitive church.
