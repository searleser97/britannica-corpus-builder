John Chilembwe,  (born c. 1860, –71—died  Feb. 3, 1915, Blantyre district, Nyasaland [now Malaŵi]), Western-educated Nyasaland missionary who led an abortive, largely symbolic, uprising against British rule in 1915 and is seen as a forerunner and martyr of Malaŵi nationalism. He was one of the first Africans to speak of Nyasaland at a time when the vast majority of his fellow subjects cared only for tribal identification.
His first prolonged experience with Europeans was from 1892 to 1895 as the servant and helper of an egalitarian fundamentalist missionary, Joseph Booth. Though proud and independent-minded, Chilembwe was eager to learn from whites and to believe the best of them. In 1897 Booth took him to the United States, where Chilembwe received a degree from a black theological college. When he returned to Nyasaland in 1900, he founded his Providence Industrial Mission to educate and instill discipline and pride in the Nyasa people of the district around Blantyre.
His revolt is thought to have been rooted in his growing disgust with the wanton cruelty of white rule, especially on white estates that had African tenants and wage earners. A more immediate cause was British use of Nyasa soldiers against the Germans in east Africa at the outbreak of World War I. When no reply was forthcoming to his written protest against conscription, he and a few followers decided on an admittedly suicidal blow. They attacked a notoriously brutal estate, killing several managers and displaying the severed head of one of them in Chilembwe’s church. Chilembwe’s instructions not to harm women and children were strictly followed. Lacking support from other districts, the revolt quickly collapsed, and Chilembwe was shot by African police.
