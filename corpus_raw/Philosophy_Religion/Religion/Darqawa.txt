Darqāwā,   brotherhood of Ṣūfīs (Muslim mystics) founded at the end of the 18th century by Mawlāy al-ʿArbī ad-Darqāwī (c. 1737–1823) in Morocco. An offshoot of the Shadhīlī Ṣūfīs, the order brought together individuals of varied social class. Its doctrine is orthodox, emphasizing devotion to, contemplation of, and union with God, attainable by frequent solitary prayer or in communal sessions where phrase repetition, poetry, song, and dance induce a state of ecstasy. Members of the Darqāwā generally refuse to participate in public life, though they did agitate against the Ottoman Turks in the early 19th century in Morocco and in Algeria upheld the nationalist cause in opposition to the policies of Abdelkader. The order is found in Morocco, Algeria, Egypt, Lebanon, and Sri Lanka.
