Electra, (Greek: “Bright One”)  in Greek legend, the daughter of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra, who saved the life of her young brother Orestes by sending him away when their father was murdered. When he later returned, she helped him to slay their mother and their mother’s lover, Aegisthus. Electra then married Orestes’ friend Pylades. The plays of the same name written by Sophocles and Euripides and the Choephoroi by Aeschylus vary the theme in detail. Many later artistic interpretations of her life exist, including Hugo von Hofmannsthal’s play Elektra (1903), later made into an opera by Richard Strauss (1906–08), and Eugene O’Neill’s play Mourning Becomes Electra (1931).
