Vasco de Quiroga,  (born 1477/78, Madrigal de las Altas Torres, Castile [Spain]—died  March 14, 1565, Pátzcuaro, Mex.), Spanish bishop, social reformer, and humanist educator who founded the Colegio de San Nicolás Obisbo in colonial Mexico.
Quiroga was educated for the priesthood and probably trained as a lawyer at the University of Valladolid. He won early recognition for his erudition at a post in the chancery of Badajoz, where he found great favour with the bishop. He was selected as the royal judge of the second audiencia (court) of New Spain and arrived in Mexico City in 1531. After founding two hospitals, he was appointed bishop of Michoacán, where he laboured diligently on behalf of the welfare of the Indians, seeking their temporal as well as spiritual salvation. To the latter end, he founded the Colegio de San Nicolás to train priests fluent in native Indian languages, and he translated religious works into those languages. Quiroga wrote Información en derecho (1535; “Information on the Law”), a utopian vision for Indian settlements in the dioceses of Michoacán.
