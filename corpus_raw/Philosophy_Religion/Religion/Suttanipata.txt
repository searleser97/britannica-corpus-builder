Suttanipāta,   (Pāli: “Collection of Discourses”), one of the earliest books of the Pāli canon (where it appears in the late Khuddaka Nikāya [“Short Collection”] of the Sutta Piṭaka). It is one of the books most quoted in other Buddhist writings, and it serves as important source of information on early Buddhism and its cultural and religious milieu. The work is largely in verse and comprises narratives, dialogues, short lyrics, proverbs, and ballads. It is concerned with the way of life of a hermit, not with an established monastic order. A simple faith is called for, worship and ritual are not mentioned, and philosophical speculation is discouraged. According to the text, what matters is the moral enterprise of the Buddhist way—the realization of the Four Noble Truths and the following of the Eightfold Path—and simple ethical rules are given as guidance.
