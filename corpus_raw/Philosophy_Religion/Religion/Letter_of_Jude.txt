Letter of Jude, also called Epistle of St. Jude, abbreviation Jude,  brief New Testament letter written to a general Christian audience. Although the epistle claims to have been written by St. Jude the Apostle, “a servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James” (1:1), the author’s identity is uncertain. The cultivated Greek style is notable for numerous figures of speech and references to both the Old and New Testaments and to other sources. References to apocryphal literature, however, may have contributed to a 3rd-century dispute about the letter’s authenticity, but its canonical status in the early church is nonetheless well attested. The letter was probably composed, at an unknown place, during the first quarter of the 2nd century and before the Second Letter of Peter, which draws upon it. It is the 26th book of the New Testament canon.
The letter appeals to Christians to “contend for the faith that was once for all entrusted to the saints” (1:3) and to be on their guard against people “who pervert the grace of our God into licentiousness and deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ” (1:4). The author struggles forcefully against heretics who deny God and Christ and attempts to strengthen his readers in their fight against such heresy that leads to wickedness and disorder. Libertinism is a characteristic of such heresy, and he warns that the punishment of the heretics will be similar to that which befell the unfaithful in the Old Testament patriarchal times. Only steadfastness in faith, true doctrine, and prayer can lead to mercy, forgiveness, restoration, and final salvation. An attempt to bring the erring to repentance may save them. The letter concludes with a typical doxology.
