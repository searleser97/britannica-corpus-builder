Motu proprio,   (Latin: “on one’s own initiative”), in the Roman Catholic church, a papal document personally signed by the pope to signify his special interest in the subject, less formal than constitutions and carrying no papal seal. Its content may be instructional (e.g., on the use of plainchant), administrative (e.g., concerning a church law or the establishment of a commission), or merely to confer a special favour. The words motu proprio always introduce the document.
