Aethra,  in Greek mythology, daughter of King Pittheus of Troezen and mother of Theseus. Thinking to help fulfill the prophecy of the Oracle at Delphi regarding how the childlessness of King Aegeus of Athens would end, Pittheus (whose prospects for a son-in-law had recently vanished) plied Aegeus with wine and lured him into Aethra’s bed. When Aegeus awoke and saw where he was, he placed as birth tokens a sword and a pair of sandals under a large rock, telling Aethra that if she bore a son who could lift the rock, she should send him to Athens with the items. In some versions, such as that of the dramatist Euripides in Hippolytus, Poseidon, the god of the sea, sired Aethra’s son while the king of Athens slept. In any event, she gave birth to Theseus, who when the time came lifted the rock, retrieved the tokens, and went to Athens, where he would eventually succeed Aegeus as king.
Theseus and his friend Perithoos kidnapped Helen to make her Theseus’s wife. Aethra guarded her while the two men went to the underworld. Helen’s brothers, Castor and Pollux, found the two women, rescued Helen, and made Aethra her slave; they then went to Sparta. Later, when Paris took Helen to Troy, Aethra accompanied them. After the fall of Troy, Theseus’s sons, Acamos and Demophon, brought Aethra back to Athens. Aethra was often portrayed in 5th-century-bc art. Favourite scenes show her being chased by Poseidon or rescued by her grandsons.
