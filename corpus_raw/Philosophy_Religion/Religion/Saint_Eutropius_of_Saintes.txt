Saint Eutropius of Saintes,  (flourished 3rd century, near Saintes, France; feast day April 30), early Christian bishop-missionary to Gaul, who was martyred by the Romans.
Eutropius was among six other illustrious apostles (including Bishop St. Denis [Dionysius] of Paris, popularly venerated as the patron of France) whom Pope Fabian dispatched from Rome about 250 to evangelize Gaul. Eutropius’ region was what is now southwestern France, where he became the first bishop of Saintes. Expelled from his see, he continued his apostolate in the vicinity. Among his converts was Eustella, the Roman governor’s daughter. Upon discovering that she had become a Christian, her father ordered Eutropius to be slain. He was hacked to death, and his corpse was discovered by Eustella, who buried him. According to the 6th-century historian St. Gregory of Tours, Eutropius’ relics were transferred in the 6th century to the Romanesque Church of St. Eutropius, Saintes, where his tomb remains.
