Arthur Hinsley,   (born Aug. 25, 1865, Carlton, Yorkshire, Eng.—died  March 17, 1943, Buntingford, Herefordshire), English Roman Catholic cardinal and fifth archbishop of Westminster who was an outspoken opponent of the fascist powers during World War II.
Educated at the English College, Rome, where he was ordained in 1893, Hinsley subsequently held various academic posts in England, at Ushaw College, Durham (1893–97), and at St. Bede’s Grammar School (which he founded), Bradford (1899–1904). He was rector of the English College in Rome (1917–28) and was later consecrated titular bishop of Sardis, now Sart, Tur. (1930). He was the first papal representative appointed to deal with the hierarchy of Africa (1930–34), but he became ill and retired in 1935. Hinsley was called out of retirement to become archbishop of Westminster (March 25, 1935) on the death (January 1) of Francis Cardinal Bourne. In October 1940 he founded the Sword of the Spirit, a politico-religious group that comprised not only Roman Catholics but also the Churches of England and Scotland, as well as the Free Churches, in its efforts to rally British churchmen against totalitarianism. Hinsley criticized the negative stand of Pope Pius XI on Italy’s invasion of Ethiopia (1935) and denounced the Hitler regime. One of his successors at Westminster, Archbishop John Heenan, wrote the biography Cardinal Hinsley (1944).
