John Geometres, also called John Kyriotes,  (flourished  10th century), Byzantine poet, official, and monk, known for his short poems in classical metre.
Geometres held the post of protospatharios (commander of the guards) at the Byzantine court and later was ordained priest. His poems, on both contemporary politics and religious subjects, are distinguished by considerable charm and appreciation of natural beauty. His prose works, most of which remained unpublished, include a life of the Virgin Mary, consisting of sermons for her feast days, and an encomium of Eveâ€™s apple.
