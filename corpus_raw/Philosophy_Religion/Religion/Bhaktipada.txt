Bhaktipada, original name Keith Gordon Ham, also known as Kirtanananda Swami,  (born September 6, 1937, Peekskill, New York, U.S.—died October 24, 2011, Thane, India), American religious leader who led the American branch of the Hare Krishna movement before a criminal investigation resulted in his expulsion and subsequent imprisonment.
Ham was raised a Baptist. He earned a B.A. (1959) from Maryville College, Maryville, Tennessee, but he failed to complete a graduate degree from Columbia University, New York City. In 1966 he joined the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON; popularly known as the Hare Krishnas) soon after meeting its founder, A.C. Bhaktivedanta (Swami Prabhupada). The following year Ham was initiated as Kirtanananda Swami. He later assumed the name Bhaktipada.
In 1968 he purchased land in the mountains of West Virginia and founded New Vrindaban, a lavish temple complex and “spiritual theme park”; he was later reprimanded by ISKCON for having allowed liturgical relaxations in order to appeal to an American audience. Allegations of sexual molestation and a federal investigation for mail fraud, racketeering, and conspiracy to murder two devotees resulted in his expulsion from ISKCON in 1987. In 1996 Bhaktipada accepted a plea deal on federal racketeering charges; he ultimately served eight years in prison.
