Varuna,  in the Vedic phase of Hindu mythology, the god-sovereign, the personification of divine authority. He is the ruler of the sky realm and the upholder of cosmic and moral law (rita), a duty shared with the group of gods known as the Adityas (see Aditi), of whom he was the chief. He is often jointly invoked with Mitra, who represents the more-juridical side of their sovereignty—the alliance between one human being and another—while Varuna represents the magical and speculative aspects—the relationship between gods and human beings. He corresponds closely to the Zoroastrian god Ahura Mazdā. In later Hinduism, Varuna plays a lesser role. He is guardian of the west and is particularly associated with oceans and waters. Thus, he is often attended by the river goddesses Ganga and Yamuna.
