Pudgalavādin, also called Vātsīputrīya,  ancient Buddhist school in India that affirmed the existence of an enduring person (pudgala) distinct from both the conditioned (saṃskṛta) and the unconditioned (asaṃskṛ-ta); the sole asaṃskṛta for them was nirvana. If consciousness exists, there must be a subject of consciousness, the pudgala; it is this alone that transmigrates from life to life.
The Sammatīya school, a derivation of the Pudgalavādin, had a wide diffusion, extending from India to Bengal and Champa, located in what now is central Vietnam; the Chinese pilgrim Hsüan-tsang described it in the 7th century as one of the four main Buddhist sects of that time. The Sammatīya believed that, although humans do not exist independently from the five skandhas (components) that make up their personalities, still they are greater than the mere sums of their parts. The Sammatīya were severely criticized by other Buddhists, who considered the theory close to the rejected theory of ātman—i.e., the supreme universal self.
