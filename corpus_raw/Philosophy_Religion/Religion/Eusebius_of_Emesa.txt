Eusebius of Emesa,  (born c. 300, Edessa, Macedonia [now in Greece]—died c. 359, Antioch, Syria [now Antakya, Tur.]), bishop of Emesa, one of the chief doctrinal writers on Semi-Arianism, a modified Arianism that held that Christ was “like” God the Father but not of one substance.
A friend of the Roman emperor Constantius II, whom he often accompanied on expeditions against the Persians, Eusebius was appointed (c. 339) to the see of Emesa. Because of his unorthodoxy, he was expelled from the city by its inhabitants but was reinstated after taking refuge with Bishop George of Laodicea, a central figure of the 4th-century Arian controversies. Fragments of George’s biography of Eusebius are preserved in the writings of the 5th-century church historians Socrates and Sozomen. Modern research has attributed 29 homilies to him.
