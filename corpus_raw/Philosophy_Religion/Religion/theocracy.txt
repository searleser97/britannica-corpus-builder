Theocracy,  government by divine guidance or by officials who are regarded as divinely guided. In many theocracies, government leaders are members of the clergy, and the stateâ€™s legal system is based on religious law. Theocratic rule was typical of early civilizations. The Enlightenment marked the end of theocracy in most Western countries. Contemporary examples of theocracies include Saudi Arabia, Iran, and the Vatican. See also church and state; sacred kingship.
