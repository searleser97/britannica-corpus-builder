Pitri, (Sanskrit: “father”) also spelled pitṛ,  in Hinduism, any of the spirits of the dead ancestors or of all the dead who have been cremated or buried in accordance with the proper rites.
In the Vedas, the sacred scriptures of ancient India, the “fathers” were considered to be immortal like the gods and to share in the sacrifice, though they received different offerings. The “way of the fathers,” which leads to rebirth (samsara) and is characterized by observance of the traditional duties of sacrifice, charity, and the practice of austerities, came to be distinguished from the “way of the gods,” which was a way of faith directed toward the goal of liberation (moksha) from rebirth.
