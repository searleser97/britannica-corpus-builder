Agunah, Hebrew ʿaguna (“deserted woman”), plural agunahs, ʿagunot, or agunoth,  in Orthodox and Conservative Judaism, a woman who is presumed to be widowed but who cannot remarry because evidence of her husband’s death does not satisfy legal requirements. The plight of the agunah has generated voluminous and complex treatment in Halakhic literature. Although religious courts are not empowered to grant remarriage without indisputable evidence of the spouse’s death, human considerations have led to a de facto relaxation of the law of evidence. The testimony of a single witness has thus been accepted as sufficient proof of death even when the body of the presumed deceased has not been recovered from, for example, a battlefield, the sea, or a disaster area.
An effort to solve the still vexing problem facing agunahs has, in some places, led to the introduction of a custom whereby soldiers sign a document authorizing a rabbinic court to grant a divorce should the soldier be officially declared missing in action and presumed dead.
Women who are victims of willful desertion are also called agunahs inasmuch as they are forbidden to remarry without a religious divorce that cannot be granted unilaterally to the wife by a religious court. Because of the severity of the biblical injunction against adultery and the possibility that a husband who was presumed dead might suddenly reappear, various proposed solutions to the problems of agunahs have enjoyed but limited acceptance. Even the great emergencies created by Jewish mass migrations at the beginning of the 20th century and the development of the vast number of missing persons after the two World Wars and the Nazi Holocaust have not led to universally accepted modifications of existing laws and practices.
