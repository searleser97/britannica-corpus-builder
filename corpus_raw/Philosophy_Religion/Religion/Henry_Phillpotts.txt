Henry Phillpotts,  (born May 6, 1778, Bridgwater, Somersetshire, Eng.—died  Sept. 18, 1869, Torquay, Devonshire), Church of England bishop of Exeter (from 1830), who represented the conservative High Church wing of the Oxford Movement and emphasized liturgical forms of worship, episcopal government, monastic life, and early Christian doctrine as normative of orthodoxy. His unsuccessful attempt to block (1847–51) the pastoral appointment of George C. Gorham because of his Calvinistic view of Baptism gave rise to one of the most publicized ecclesiastical lawsuits in the 19th century and agitated High Church feeling against Parliament’s intervention in religious questions. He actively supported Tory politics, opposing social reform and religious toleration.
