United Pentecostal Church, Inc.,,   Protestant denomination organized in St. Louis, Mo., U.S., in 1945 by merger of the Pentecostal Assemblies of Jesus Christ and the Pentecostal Church, Inc. It is the largest of the Jesus Only groups (a movement for which the sacrament of baptism is given in the name of Jesus only, rather than in the name of the Trinity), and it emphasizes justification and baptism of the Holy Spirit (demonstrated by speaking in tongues) and practices foot washing, healing, and conscientious objection. It has a rigid holiness code of behaviour and dress. The church government is congregational with a General Conference, made up of all ministers and one layman from each congregation, which meets annually. Headquarters are located in St. Louis, Mo.
