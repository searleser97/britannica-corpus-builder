Heart Sutra, Sanskrit Prajnaparamitahridaya-sutra (“Discourse on the Heart of the Perfection of Wisdom”),  in Mahayana Buddhism, an extremely brief yet highly influential distillation of the essence of Prajnaparamita (“Perfection of Wisdom”) writings, much reproduced and recited throughout East and Central Asia.
True to its title, this short sutra goes to the heart of the doctrine it summarizes. In the space of a single page (some versions adding an introductory and a concluding paragraph), in words ascribed to the bodhisattva (“buddha-to-be”) of compassion, Avalokiteshvara, the Heart Sutra discusses the doctrine of “emptiness” (shunyata), which is the nature of reality. The process of death and rebirth (samsara), the suffering (dukkha) that one experiences while knowing that one may die, the effects of past actions (karma) that bind one to samsara, the skandhas that constitute a sense of selfhood, the ephemeral and microscopic dharmas that constitute phenomenal reality—all are revealed to be devoid of permanence, and thus “empty.” Awareness of such emptiness leads to release (moksha) from samsara and to the wisdom that precedes enlightenment (bodhi).
