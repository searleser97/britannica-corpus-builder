Letter of Paul to Titus, also called Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to Titus, abbreviation Titus,  New Testament writing addressed to one of St. Paul the Apostle’s close companions, St. Titus, who was the organizer of the churches in Crete. It is the 17th book of the New Testament canon. The letter to Titus and the two Letters of Paul to Timothy have been called the Pastoral Epistles because they deal principally with heresies and church discipline. That Paul actually wrote the letter to Titus has been much disputed, the answer depending on arguments that extend also to the two letters to Timothy. Many scholars consider the three Pastoral Epistles to be “deutero-Pauline,” meaning that they were written in the tradition of Paul but not authored by him.
The letter urges Titus to appoint worthy elders to positions of responsibility, to preach sound doctrine, and to exemplify in his own life the virtues that are expected of all Christians. It warns against the disruptive influence of “Jewish myths” and teachings put forward by “those of the circumcision.”
