Paryuṣaṇa, (Sanskrit), Prākrit Pajjusaṇa,  a popular eight-day festival in Jainism, a religion of India. It generally is celebrated by members of the Śvetāmbara sect from the 13th day of the dark half of the month Bhādrapada (August–September) to the 5th day of the bright half of the month. Among Digambaras, a corresponding festival is called Daśalakṣaṇa, and it begins immediately following the Śvetāmbara Paryuṣaṇa.
Paryuṣaṇa closes the Jaina year. Jainas make confessions at the meetinghouse so that no quarrel is carried over into the new year, and many lay members temporarily live the lives of monks, an observance called poṣadha. The fourth day of Paryuṣaṇa coincides with the birth anniversary of Mahāvīra.
The last day of the festival, Bhadra-śukla-pañcamī (“Fifth Day of the Bright Fortnight of Bhādra”), is also an ancient Indian festival day known to Hindus as Ṛṣi-pañcamī (“The Fifth of the Seers”), the day on which Hindus pay homage to the seven seers, who are identified with the seven stars of the constellation Ursa Major, then visible. On that day Jainas distribute alms to the poor and take out a Jina (saviour) image in a procession that is headed by an ornamental pole called Indra-dhvaja (“Staff of Indra”). The Kalpa-sūtra, a sacred text that describes the lives of the Jinas, is read before the laity by monks, and the miniature paintings illustrating the incidents are shown and revered. The last day is a day of fasting, though the very pious observe a fast throughout the eight-day festival.
