Nashim,   (Hebrew: “Women”), the third of the six major divisions, or orders (sedarim), of the Mishna (codification of Jewish oral laws), which was given its final form early in the 3rd century ad by Judah ha-Nasi. Nashim covers principally aspects of married life. The seven tractates (treatises) of Nashim are: Yevamot (“Levirates”; i.e., husband’s brothers), Ketubbot (“Marriage Contracts”), Nedarim (“Vows”), Nazir (a “Nazirite”; i.e., a vowed ascetic), Soṭa (“A Woman Suspected of Adultery”), Giṭṭin (“Bills of Divorce”), and Qiddushin (“Marriages”). Both the Palestinian and Babylonian Talmuds have Gemara (critical commentaries) on each of the seven tractates.
