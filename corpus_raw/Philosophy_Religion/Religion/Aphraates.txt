Aphraates, Syriac Afrahat,  (flourished 4th century), Syrian ascetic and the earliest-known Christian writer of the Syriac church in Persia.
Aphraates became a convert to Christianity during the reign of the anti-Christian Persian king Shāpūr II (309–379), after which he led a monastic life, possibly at the Monastery of St. Matthew near Mosul, Iraq. Later he may have become a bishop when he assumed the name James. Termed “the Persian Sage,” Aphraates between the years 336 and 345 composed Syriac biblical commentaries (23 of which have been preserved) for his monastic colleagues. They are inaccurately known as his “Homilies,” and they survey the Christian faith predominantly in theological, ascetical, and disciplinary matters, at times marked by a sharp polemical nature. Nine treatises against the Jews, who were numerous in Mesopotamia and had established outstanding schools, are particularly acrimonious; they treat of Easter, circumcision, dietary laws, the supplanting of Israel by Gentiles as the new chosen people, and Jesus’ divine sonship.
Aphraates’ writings are distinguished by their primitive biblical-theological tradition, as yet unaffected by the doctrinal controversies and linguistic complexity growing out of the Trinitarian (nature of God) and Christological (nature of Christ) controversies prior and subsequent to the Council of Nicaea in 325. Insulated from the intellectual currents traversing the Greco-Roman ecclesiastical world, the “Homilies” manifest a teaching indigenous to early Assyrian Judeo-Christianity.
