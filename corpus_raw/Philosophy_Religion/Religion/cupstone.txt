Cupstone,   in prehistoric European religion, an altar stone, megalithic tomb, or isolated stone slab incised with small cuplike markings. They are found mainly in Scandinavia and northern and central Germany. Dating primarily to Neolithic times, cupstones have also been discovered that were carved in the Early Paleolithic Period and at the beginning of historical times. Although most scholars generally consider the cupstones to be solar symbols, especially when found in connection with other carvings known to have solar reference, there is still disagreement on the origin and purpose of the markings.
