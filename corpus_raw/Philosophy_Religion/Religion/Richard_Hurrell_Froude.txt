Richard Hurrell Froude,  (born March 25, 1803, Dartington, Devon, Eng.—died  Feb. 28, 1836, Dartington), Anglican churchman and a leader of the Oxford Movement, which sought to reintroduce High Church, or “catholic,” thought and practice into the Church of England.
Froude was educated at Oriel College, Oxford (B.A., 1824; M.A., 1827), where he met John Keble, and was tutor of his college (1827–30), when he met John Henry Newman. He was ordained in 1829. His importance thenceforth lay in two associated fields. First, he became a vocal opponent of the Erastianism and liberalism that seemed to him to threaten the Anglican church’s independence and authority. Second, he became intimate with Newman, assisted his conversion to High Church views, and by bringing him into close touch with Keble formed the team that began the Tracts for the Times and thus started the Oxford Movement in 1833. He died, age 32, of tuberculosis.
