Ascension of Isaiah,  pseudepigraphal work surviving intact only in a 5th–7th-century-ad Ethiopic edition. Fragments exist in Greek, Coptic, Latin, and Old Slavonic. Three separate works comprise the total book, the final version by a Christian editor, which appeared in the 2nd century ad. The first section is entitled “The Martyrdom of Isaiah,” a Midrash on the Manasseh story in II Kings 21, possibly written originally in Hebrew or Aramaic in the early 1st century ad. It includes a legendary martyr motif and extensive passages on demonology. The second is the “Testament of Hezekiah,” a Christian work, dating from the late 1st century ad, that contains a concept of Antichrist as a spirit dwelling in the Roman emperor Nero (ad 54–68), whose persecution of Christians in 64–65 was thought to be the chaos preceding the advent of the messianic age. The third work is called the “Ascension (or Vision) of Isaiah,” also written by a Christian at the beginning of the 2nd century. It contains a description of the seven tiers of heaven paralleling that found in the Second Book of Enoch and in the New Testament.
Both of the Christian sections are apocalypses, although they contain certain historical details on the state of the church at the end of the 1st century that coincide with descriptions given in the Second Letter of Peter, Second Letter of Paul to Timothy, and the letters of Clement of Rome. The martyr legend in the Jewish section has been linked with the tradition of royal persecutors associated with Antiochus IV Epiphanes of Syria (175–164/163 bc), although the details of Isaiah’s martyrdom may represent the incorporation into Judaism of the myth of Adonis, the Near Eastern (later Greek) god. It has also been suggested that The Martyrdom of Isaiah was written by a member of the Qumrān sect of Essene Jews, who saw Isaiah as a type figure of their leader, the Teacher of Righteousness.
