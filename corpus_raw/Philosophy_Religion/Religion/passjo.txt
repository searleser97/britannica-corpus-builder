Påssjo,  the sacred area in a Sami kota, or tent, found directly behind the central hearth. Strictly forbidden to women, the påssjo was furnished with its own entrance and sometimes set off with poles to separate it from the living space in the rest of the kota. The påssjo held all objects of value, such as hunting weapons, which women were not allowed to touch; it also held cooking utensils, dishes, and the food of the household, access to all of which was thus controlled by men. The Sami shaman (noiade) also stored his magic drum (kobdas) and other magic implements there. Bear hunters left for and returned from a hunt through the påssjo door, after which the women spat alder juice upon them. The dead were also removed through this door. The entire kota was a microcosmic representation of the universe. In such an arrangement the påssjo corresponded to the centre of the universe, its most sacred locality.
