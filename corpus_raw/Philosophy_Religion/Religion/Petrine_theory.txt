Petrine theory,  the basis of Roman Catholic doctrine on papal primacy, resting partly on Christ’s bestowing the “keys of the Kingdom” on Peter (the first pope, according to Roman Catholic tradition) and partly on Christ’s words: “And I tell you, you are Peter [Greek: Petros], and on this rock [Greek: petra] I will build my church” (Matthew 16:18). See also papacy; pope.
