Archon,  in gnosticism, any of a number of world-governing powers that were created with the material world by a subordinate deity called the Demiurge (Creator). Although gnosticism did not constitute a single movement, most gnostics were religious dualists who held that matter is inferior and the spirit is good and that salvation is attained by esoteric knowledge, or gnosis.
Because the gnostics of the 2nd and 3rd centuries regarded the material world as outright evil or as the product of error, Archons were viewed as maleficent forces. They numbered 7 or 12 and were identified with the seven planets of antiquity or with the signs of the zodiac. Some gnostic thinkers, such as Valentinus, developed mythologies inspired by the Christian idea of salvation through the Incarnation of Christ. In these narratives the Demiurge and the Archons were identified with the God, the angels, and the Law of the Old Testament and hence received Hebrew names. The recurring image of Archons is that of jailers imprisoning the divine spark in human souls held captive in material creation. According to some mythologies, the purpose of the gnosis sent from the realms of divine light beyond the universe, through the divine emanation (aeon) Christ, was to enable gnostic initiates to pass through the spheres of the Archons into the realms of light.
