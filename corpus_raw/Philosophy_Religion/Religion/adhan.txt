adhān,  (Arabic: “announcement”), the Muslim call to Friday public worship (jumʿah) and to the five daily hours of prayer. It is proclaimed by the muezzin, a servant of the mosque chosen for good character, as he stands at the door or side of a small mosque or in the minaret of a large one. The adhān was originally a simple “Come to prayer,” but, according to tradition, Muhammad consulted his followers with a view to investing the call with greater dignity. The matter was settled when ʿAbd Allāh ibn Zayd dreamed that the faithful should be summoned by a crier. The standard adhān can be translated as: “Allāh is most great. I testify that there is no god but Allāh. I testify that Muhammad is the prophet of Allāh. Come to prayer. Come to salvation. Allāh is most great. There is no god but Allāh.” The first phrase is proclaimed four times, the final phrase once, and the others twice, the worshipers making a set response to each phrase. Shiʿis often add the phrase “I testify that ʿAlī is the vice-regent of Allāh” to the recitation of the adhān.
