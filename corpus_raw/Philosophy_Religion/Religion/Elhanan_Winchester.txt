Elhanan Winchester,  (born Sept. 30, 1751, Brookline, Mass., U.S.—died April 18, 1797, Hartford, Conn.), American preacher and revivalist who helped to spread Universalism in the United States. Urged by the French-British theologian George de Benneville (1703–93) to read Universalist works, Winchester converted from Baptism to Universalism. He preached throughout the North American colonies, founded Philadelphia’s first Universalist church, and traveled to England, where he founded a Universalist church in London in 1793 and wrote The Universal Restoration, Exhibited in Four Dialogues Between a Minister and His Friend (1794). As a restorationist Universalist, he emphasized scriptural texts that affirmed the finite and remedial nature of punishment after death.
