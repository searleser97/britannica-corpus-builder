Nicholas Ridley,   (born c. 1500, /03, South Tynedale, Northumberland, Eng.—died  Oct. 16, 1555, Oxford, Oxfordshire), Protestant martyr, one of the finest academic minds in the early English Reformation.
Ridley attended Pembroke Hall, Cambridge, and was ordained a priest (c. 1524). After a period of study in France, he returned to Cambridge, where he settled down to a scholarly career. About 1534 Ridley began to show sympathies with Protestant doctrines, and in 1537 he became one of the chaplains to the prominent Reformer Thomas Cranmer, archbishop of Canterbury. Elected master of Pembroke Hall, Cambridge, in 1540, he took a leading part in transforming the university into a Reformist seminary that would soon contribute greatly to the intellectual life of English Protestantism. Meanwhile, he became canon of Canterbury (1541) and of Westminster (1545).
Ridley came to be suspected of heresy when a Roman Catholic reaction set in during the last years of the reign of King Henry VIII (reigned 1509–47). Nevertheless, with the rapid advance toward Protestantism after the accession of King Edward VI (reigned 1547–53), Ridley was appointed bishop of Rochester. In 1550 he became bishop of London, replacing the deposed conservative Edmund Bonner. Under Ridley the see of London was made into a showpiece of Reformed England. In particular, he created an uproar with his campaign for the use of a plain table for communion instead of the altar. He denied the doctrine of transubstantiation—that Christ’s natural body is present in the bread of the Eucharist after consecration.
Ridley supported the claim of the Protestant Lady Jane Grey to be Edward VI’s successor and hence was arrested (July 1553) upon the accession of the rightful heir, Queen Mary Tudor, a Roman Catholic. Ridley and another Protestant notable, Hugh Latimer, both of whom had refused to recant, were burned at the stake in October 1555.
