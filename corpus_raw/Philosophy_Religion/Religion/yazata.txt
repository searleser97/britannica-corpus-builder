Yazata,   in Zoroastrianism, member of an order of angels created by Ahura Mazdā to help him maintain the flow of the world order and quell the forces of Ahriman and his demons. They gather the light of the Sun and pour it on the Earth. Their help is indispensable in aiding man to purify and elevate himself. They teach him to dispel demons and free himself of the future torments of hell. Persons who remember the yazata through ritual offerings receive their favour and prosper. Zoroaster prayed to them to grant him strength for his mission.
The principal yazatas are mostly ancient Iranian deities reduced to auxiliary status: Ātar (Fire), Mithra, Anahita, Rashnu (The Righteous), Sraosha, and Verethraghna.
