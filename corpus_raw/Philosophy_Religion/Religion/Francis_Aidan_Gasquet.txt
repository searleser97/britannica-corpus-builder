Francis Aidan Gasquet, in full Francis Neil Aidan Gasquet,  (born Oct. 5, 1846, London, Eng.—died  April 5, 1929, Rome, Italy), English Roman Catholic historian, a cardinal from 1914, and prefect of the Vatican archives from 1917.
Educated at Downside School (Somerset), Gasquet entered the Benedictine monastery there and was prior from 1878 to 1885. From 1888 onward he published works on monastic history, including Henry VIII and the English Monasteries (1888–89), which has considerable value but is regarded by some as biased and occasionally inaccurate. Other works include A History of the Church in England, 2 vol. (1897), and Parish Life in Medieval England (1909).
