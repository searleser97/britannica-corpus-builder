Matthäus Schiner, also spelled Mathias Schinner,  (born c. 1465, Mühlebach, Switz.—died  Oct. 1, 1522, Rome), Swiss prelate, papal diplomat, and intimate counsellor of the Holy Roman emperor Charles V; he worked to preserve the freedom of the Papal States from French domination.
Consecrated bishop of Sion in 1499, Schiner soon established himself as a master of diplomacy. He helped secure Bellinzona and the Blenio Valley for the cantons of Uri, Schwyz, and Nidwalden (Treaty of Arona, 1503) and acted on behalf of Pope Julius II to obtain the support of Swiss mercenaries against King Louis XII of France. Created cardinal in March 1511, he was installed at the see of Novara shortly thereafter. Schiner was largely responsible for the accession of Massimiliano Sforza to the ducal throne at Milan (1513) and played an important role in the elevation of Leo X to the papacy (1513). After the victory of the new French king, Francis I, against the Swiss at the Battle of Marignano (1515), he worked for an alliance embracing the papacy, the Habsburg dominions, and England. A supporter of the election of Charles I of Spain to the imperial title (as Charles V) in 1519, he subsequently became the new Emperor’s confidant and encouraged the issuance of the imperial ban against the Reformer Martin Luther (1521). In August 1521, as imperial envoy to the Swiss confederation, Schiner once again secured Swiss mercenaries on behalf of the emperor and the pope. Throughout his diplomatic career, he was amply rewarded for his services with clerical endowments. He died during an outbreak of plague.
