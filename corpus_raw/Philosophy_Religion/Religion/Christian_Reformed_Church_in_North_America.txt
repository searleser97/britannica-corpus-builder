Christian Reformed Church in North America,  Protestant denomination that developed in the United States from a group that separated in 1857 from the Reformed Protestant Dutch Church (now the Reformed Church in America) and called itself the True Holland Reformed Church. It was strengthened in 1882 when it was joined by other dissenters from the Reformed Church in America who believed that the parent church should reject Freemasonry. In 1890 it united with the True Reformed Dutch Church of New York and New Jersey, which had been formed in 1822 by members who left the Reformed Protestant Dutch Church because of doctrinal disagreements. Also in 1890, the present name was adopted. The primary membership of the Christian Reformed Church, however, came from Dutch immigrants. Canadian churches were established early in the 20th century.
The Christian Reformed Church is a conservative body that maintains an orthodox interpretation of its doctrinal standards, the Heidelberg Catechism (1562), the Belgic Confession (1561), and the canons of Dort (1618â€“19). The theology and polity are Calvinist. Although worship services were held in the Dutch language for many years, the English language is now used. The church supports a system of elementary and high schools.
In 2005 the church reported more than 270,000 members in over 750 congregations in North America. U.S. headquarters are in Grand Rapids, Mich. Canadian headquarters are in Burlington, Ont.
