Saint Antoninus, original name Antonino Pierozzi, or Antonino de’ Forciglioni, Antonino also spelled Antonio,  (born March 1, 1389, Florence—died May 2, 1459, Florence; canonized 1523; feast day May 10), archbishop of Florence who is regarded as one of the founders of modern moral theology and Christian social ethics.
In Florence Antoninus joined the Dominican order (1405); he became an active leader of the order’s Observant movement, especially at Fiesole, near Florence. As vicar of the Observants he founded the convent of San Marco, Florence, in 1436. There he served as prior (1439–44) and attended the Council of Florence (1439–45).
He became archbishop of Florence (1446), where he was greatly beloved for his charity and particularly for his indefatigable aid during the plague of 1448 and the earthquake 1453. He was canonized by Pope Adrian VI. Antoninus’ principal works are his Summa moralis (Venice, 1477) and Summa confessionum (Mondovì, 1472).
