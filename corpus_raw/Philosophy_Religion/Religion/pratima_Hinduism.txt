Pratima, (Sanskrit: “image” or “likeness” of a deity) also called murti (Sanskrit: “form” or “manifestation”) or vigraha (Sanskrit: “form”),  in Hinduism, a sacred image or depiction of a deity.
By depicting the deity with multiple heads, arms, or eyes or with animal features, the image, or icon, represents the deity’s many different aspects and powers. It serves as a vehicle through which the infinite and unmanifest god willingly takes finite and manifest form; the deity, when invoked, is believed to be present in the icon. Worship centring on the image has been a form of Hindu religious practice for about 2,000 years.
Most Hindu images are constructed by artisans following strict guidelines and are consecrated in a ceremony. Such images can be permanent and housed in temples or homes. Others are temporary and used only for the duration of a festival. Still other images are aniconic and found in nature, such as a special type of fossil known as the shalagrama that is sacred to the god Vishnu. The mass printing of colour reproductions in poster form has extended the availability of images to greater numbers of devotees.
