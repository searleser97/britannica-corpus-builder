John Murray,  (born Dec. 10, 1741, Alton, Hampshire, Eng.—died Sept. 3, 1815, Boston, Mass., U.S.), English Protestant minister and theologian who founded the first Universalist congregation in the United States. At first a Methodist, Murray sought to refute the Welsh minister James Relly’s unorthodox teaching that Jesus Christ’s suffering and crucifixion brought salvation for all humanity. Instead he became convinced that Relly was right and began preaching universal salvation. Shortly thereafter, his wife and infant son died, causing a crisis of faith that spurred Murray to leave both the pulpit and England. After arriving in the American colonies, however, his faith was renewed, and he began preaching Universalist theology in Virginia, New Jersey, and finally (starting in 1770), New England, where he spent the majority of his career. He founded a church at Gloucester, Mass., in 1780 and subsequently preached in Oxford, Mass., and Boston.
