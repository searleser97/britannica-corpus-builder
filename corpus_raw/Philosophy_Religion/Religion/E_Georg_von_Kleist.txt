E. Georg von Kleist,  (born c. 1700, Prussian Pomerania?—died  Dec. 11, 1748, Köslin, Pomerania?), German administrator and cleric who discovered (1745) the Leyden jar, a fundamental electric circuit element for storing electricity, now usually referred to as a capacitor. The device was independently discovered at about the same time by Pieter van Musschenbroek, who investigated it more thoroughly than Kleist.
