Mary Frances Clarke,  (born March 2, 1803, Dublin, Ire.—died Dec. 4, 1887, Dubuque, Iowa, U.S.),  Irish-born religious leader and educator, a founder of the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, who extended educational opportunities on the American frontier.
Clarke was early drawn to the religious life. For some years after the death of her father, she successfully carried on his leather business and cared for her family. In 1831, while nursing victims of a cholera epidemic, she met four like-minded young women with whom, the next year, she opened Miss Clarke’s Seminary for poor Catholic children in Dublin. In 1833 the five women immigrated to the United States and began teaching in Philadelphia. They formally organized themselves on All Saints Day, November 1, 1833, as the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Sister Mary immediately became Mother Mary, superior of the fledgling order. In 1843, on invitation by Bishop Matthias Loras and Father Pierre De Smet, Mother Mary and four sisters made their way to the still-primitive frontier village of Dubuque, becoming the first Roman Catholic nuns in Iowa Territory. Under Mother Mary’s leadership, the Sisters of Charity opened and staffed St. Mary’s Female Academy (later Mount St. Joseph’s Academy) in 1843. The school subsequently developed into Mount St. Joseph College and in 1928 was renamed Clarke College. Mother Mary, a reclusive figure even within her order, governed the sisters until her death.
