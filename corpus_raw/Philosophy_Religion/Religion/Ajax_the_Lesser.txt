Ajax, (Latin), Greek Aias, byname Ajax the Lesser,  in Greek legend, son of Oileus, king of Locris; he was said to be boastful, arrogant, and quarrelsome. For his crime of dragging King Priam’s daughter Cassandra from the statue of the goddess Athena and violating her, he barely escaped being stoned to death by his Greek allies. Odysseus knew that Athena would be angry and advised the Greeks to put Ajax to death. When the Greeks were sailing away from Troy, the goddess, with the help of Poseidon, caused a tremendous storm. Ajax’s ship was wrecked, but he swam to a rock and boasted to the gods of his escape. Then he was cast by Poseidon into the sea and drowned.
Ajax was worshiped as a national hero by the Opuntian Locrians (who lived on the Malian Gulf in central Greece and on whose coins he appeared), who always left a vacant place for him in their battle line.
