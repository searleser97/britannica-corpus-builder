Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria,   autocephalous, or ecclesiastically independent, Eastern Orthodox patriarchate, second in honorific rank after the Church of Constantinople; its patriarch is considered the successor of St. Mark the Evangelist and heads the Orthodox Church in Africa. The Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria and All Africa, as it is also known, is the continuation of the Melchite, or imperial, church of Egypt—mostly Greeks living in Egypt—that accepted the definition of the two natures of Christ proposed at the Council of Chalcedon (451 ad; see Melchite). The majority of Christian Egyptians rejected this definition and formed the Coptic Church, also headed by a “patriarch of Alexandria.” The small Greek minority that remained in communion with the other Orthodox Christians came under Muslim rule in the 7th century and became smaller still but continued to exist in Alexandria and in Cairo after the mass conversions to Islām.
In the 19th century, Egyptian prosperity caused thousands of Greeks and Syrians to immigrate there, thus rapidly increasing the size of the Greek Orthodox Church in Egypt. Many Orthodox settlements were established in African countries outside Egypt in the 20th century, enabling the creation of Orthodox sees in Tripoli, Libya; Addis Ababa, Eth.; Tunis; Khartoum, Sudan; and Johannesburg. In Egypt itself the number of Orthodox faithful is steadily diminishing. The membership of the church is difficult to estimate, but by 1980 it was probably about 110,000.
