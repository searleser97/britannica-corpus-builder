Ibn Abī ʿAṣrūn, in full Sharaf al-Dīn Abū Saʿd ʿAbd Allāh ibn Muḥammad ibn Hibat Allāh ibn Muṭahhar al-Tamīmī al-Mawṣilī ibn Abī ʿAṣrūn, also called al-Ḥalabī or al-Dimashqī,  (born February 1099/1100, Ḥadīthah, Baghdad Caliphate [now in Iraq]—died October/November 1189, Damascus [now in Syria]), scholar who became a leading Shāfiʿī (one of the four schools of Islamic law) theologian and the chief judicial officer of the Ayyūbid caliphate.
After completing his theological training, Ibn Abī ʿAṣrūn held various religious and judicial posts in Iraq. In 1154 he was invited to Damascus by its ruler; he taught religious subjects there and became the administrator of the waqfs (religious endowments). He held numerous other judicial appointments in Syria, Iraq, and Turkey until in 1177/78 the famous Saladin, the Ayyūbid sultan, appointed him as the Shāfiʿī qāḍī (“judge”) of Syria, the highest judicial appointment in the realm.
Ibn Abī ʿAṣrūn had to retire because of blindness in 1179/80. During his lifetime six madrasas (religious colleges) were built in his honour. He wrote a number of works on religious subjects, none of which is extant.
