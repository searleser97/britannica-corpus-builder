Constantine (II),  (born 8th century—died, Rome?), antipope from 767 to 768.
He was a soldier and—through the support of his brother Toto, duke of the bishopric of Nepi near Rome—was elected pope on July 5, 767, to succeed St. Paul I. Constantine’s opponents, led by Christopher, the powerful chief of the notaries, fled to the Lombards. Constantine, failing to win support from the Carolingian king Pippin III the Short or from the Franks, was deposed the next year by a Lombard army and imprisoned in a monastery, where he was attacked and blinded. His deposition was canonically ratified by a council of Italian and Frankish bishops. After 769 no more was heard of him. His brief reign revealed how the Holy See was then coveted by temporal rulers.
