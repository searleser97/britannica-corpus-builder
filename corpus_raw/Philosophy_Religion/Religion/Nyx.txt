Nyx,  in Greek mythology, female personification of night but also a great cosmogonical figure, feared even by Zeus, the king of the gods, as related in Homer’s Iliad, Book XIV.
According to Hesiod’s Theogony, she was the daughter of Chaos and the mother of numerous primordial powers, including Sleep, Death, the Fates, Nemesis, and Old Age. The Orphic Rhapsodies made her the daughter and successor of Phanes, a creator god; she continued to advise her own successors (Uranus, her son by Phanes; Cronus, youngest son of Uranus; and Zeus) by means of her oracular gifts. Aristotle, in Metaphysics, Book XII, asserted that some “theologians” derive all things from night. This idea fits the theogony of Aristophanes’ Birds. Throughout antiquity Nyx caught the imagination of poets and artists, but she was seldom worshipped.
