Ahura Mazdā, (Avestan: “Wise Lord”) also spelled Ormizd or Ormazd,  supreme god in ancient Iranian religion, especially Zoroastrianism, the religious system of the Iranian prophet Zarathustra (c. 6th century bce; Greek name Zoroaster). Ahura Mazdā was worshipped by the Persian king Darius I (reigned 522–486 bce) and his successors as the greatest of all gods and protector of the just king.
According to Zarathustra, Ahura Mazdā created the universe and the cosmic order that he maintains. He created the twin spirits Spenta Mainyu and Angra Mainyu (Ahriman)—the former beneficent, choosing truth, light, and life; and the latter destructive, choosing deceit, darkness, and death. The struggle of the spirits against each other makes up the history of the world and is reflected in the choice between good and evil that humanity constantly faces.
In Zoroastrianism as reflected in the Avesta, Ahura Mazdā is identified with Spenta Mainyu and is directly opposed to Angra Mainyu. Ahura Mazdā is all-wise, bounteous, undeceiving, and the creator of everything good. The beneficent and evil spirits are conceived as mutually limiting, coeternal beings, the one above and the other beneath, with the world in between as their battleground. In late sources (3rd century ce onward), Zurvān (“Time”) is made the father of the twins Ormazd and Ahriman, who reign alternately over the world until Ormazd’s ultimate victory.
Something of this conception is reflected in Manichaeism, in which God is sometimes called Zurvān, while Ormazd is his first emanation, Primal Man, who is vanquished by the destructive spirit of darkness but rescued by God’s second emanation, the Living Spirit.
