Telegonus,  in Greek mythology, especially the Telagonia of Eugammon of Cyrene, the son of the hero Odysseus by the sorceress Circe. Telegonus went to Ithaca in search of his father, whom he killed unwittingly. His spear had been tipped with the point of a stingray, thus fulfilling the prophecy in Homer’s Odyssey that death would come to Odysseus “from the sea.” Telegonus returned with Odysseus’s widow, Penelope, and her son (his half-brother) Telemachus to Aeaea, Circe’s island, to bury Odysseus. Telemachus married Circe, and Telegonus married Penelope. According to the mythographer Hyginus, Telegonus and Penelope had a son Italus, the eponymous hero of Italy.
