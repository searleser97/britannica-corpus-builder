True Cross,  Christian relic, reputedly the wood of the cross on which Jesus Christ was crucified. Legend relates that the True Cross was found by St. Helena, mother of Constantine the Great, during her pilgrimage to the Holy Land about 326.
The earliest historical reference to veneration of the True Cross occurs in the mid-4th century. By the 8th century the accounts were enriched by legendary details describing the history of the wood of the cross before it was used for the Crucifixion.
Adoration of the True Cross gave rise to the sale of its fragments which were sought as relics. John Calvin pointed out that all the extant fragments, if put together, would fill a large ship, an objection regarded as invalid by some Roman Catholic theologians who claimed that the blood of Christ gave to the True Cross a kind of material indestructibility, so that it could be divided indefinitely without being diminished. Such beliefs resulted in the multiplication of relics of the True Cross wherever Christianity expanded in the medieval world, and fragments were deposited in most of the great cities and in a great many abbeys. Reliquaries designed to hold the fragments likewise multiplied, and some precious objects of this kind survive.
The desire to win back or obtain possession of the True Cross was claimed as justification for military expeditions, such as that of the Byzantine emperor Heraclius against the Persians (622â€“628) and the capture of Constantinople by the crusaders in 1204.
The Feast of the Finding of the Cross was celebrated in the Roman Catholic Church on May 3 until it was omitted from the church calendar in 1960 by Pope John XXIII.
