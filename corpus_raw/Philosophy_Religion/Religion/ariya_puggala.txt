Ariya-puggala, (Pali:  “noble person”)  abbreviation ariya, Sanskrit arya-pudgala,  in Theravada Buddhism, a person who has attained one of the four levels of holiness. A first type of holy person, called a sotapanna-puggala (“stream-winner”), is one who will attain nibbana (Sanskrit nirvana)—release (moksha) from the cycle of death and rebirth (samsara), the supreme goal of Buddhist practice—after no more than seven rebirths. Another type of holy person is termed a sakadagamin (“once-returner”), or one who is destined to be reborn in the human world only once more before reaching nibbana. A third type of ariya-puggala is the anagamin (“never-returner”), or one who will not be reborn in the human realm and will enter the realm of the gods at the time of death. The never-returner, however, is still not considered to have reached nibbana.
The Theravada Buddhist at the highest level of holiness is the arhat, one who has reached final and absolute emancipation from all rebirths in any human or superhuman realm. The arhat—a model person for Theravada Buddhists—is to be distinguished from the personal ideal of the Mahayana Buddhist schools (whose scriptures and treatises are written in Sanskrit rather than in Pali) the bodhisattva (“buddha-to-be”). The latter is a holy person who has reached enlightenment but refuses to enter nirvana, choosing rather to teach his insights until all creatures have similarly been liberated.
