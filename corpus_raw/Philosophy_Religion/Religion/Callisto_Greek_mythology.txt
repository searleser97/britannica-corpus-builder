Callisto,  in Greek mythology, a nymph, or else a daughter of either Lycaon of Arcadia or of Nycteus or Ceteus. Callisto was one of the goddess Artemis’ huntress companions and swore to remain unwed. But she was loved by Zeus and, in several variations of the legend, was turned into a she-bear either by Zeus (to conceal his deed from Hera) or by Artemis or Hera (who were enraged at her unchastity). Callisto was then killed during the chase by Artemis, who, owing to the machinations of the jealous Hera, mistook Callisto for a real bear. Zeus then gave Arcas, his child with Callisto, to the Titaness Maia to raise. He then placed Callisto among the stars as the constellation Ursa Major (Great Bear). In Ovid’s Metamorphoses, Book II, Arcas was transformed into the brilliant star Arcturus just as he was about to kill his mother during a hunt; he was the eponymous hero of Arcadia.
