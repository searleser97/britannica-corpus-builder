Alexandre-Rodolphe Vinet,  (born June 17, 1797, Ouchy, Switz.—died  May 4, 1847, Clarens), French-Swiss theologian, moralist, and literary critic who was instrumental in establishing the Reformation in French-speaking Switzerland.
After studying theology at the University of Lausanne, he taught French at the University of Basel (1817–37) before returning to Lausanne as professor of practical theology (1837–45) and French literature (1845–46) at the Académie.
Ordained in 1819, he advocated freedom of religious practice (Mémoire en faveur de la liberté des cultes, 1826; “A Report Favouring the Freedom of Sects”) and defended the separation of church and state (Essai sur la manifestation des convictions religieuses et sur la séparation de l’Église et de l’État, 1842; “Essay on the Manifestation of Religious Convictions and on the Separation of Church and State”). He held that conscience, not theological dogma, is man’s true moral guide. In 1845–47, because of civil interference with the Swiss national church’s autonomy, he led a secession that took the name of Free Church. His emphasis on personal religious observance and his pragmatic approach to church dogma proved influential in France and England as well as in Switzerland.
Vinet was also a noteworthy critic, as is evident in his Études sur Blaise Pascal (1848; Studies of Blaise Pascal). Most of his purely literary work, such as Études sur la littérature française au dix-neuvième siècle, 3 vol. (1849–51; “Studies of French Literature in the Nineteenth Century”), was published posthumously.
