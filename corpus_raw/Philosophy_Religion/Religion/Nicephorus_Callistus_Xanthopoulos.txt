Nicephorus Callistus Xanthopoulos, also spelled Nikephoros Kallistos Xanthopoulos,  (born c. 1256—died c. 1335), Byzantine historian and litterateur whose stylistic prose and poetry exemplify the developing Byzantine humanism of the 13th and 14th centuries and whose 23-volume Ecclesiasticae historiae (“Church History”), of which only the first 18 volumes survive, constitutes a significant documentary source for material on primitive Christianity, its doctrinal controversies and Christological heresies, and for hagiographical, liturgical, and legendary texts from Byzantine culture.
One of the clerics attached to Constantinople’s basilica of Hagia Sophia (Greek: Holy Wisdom), Nicephorus was trained in the florid, rhetorical style of Renaissance Byzantine historiography; he taught rhetoric and theology and in his later years became a monk. Using the basilica’s manuscript library, he compiled his major work, the 18-volume Ecclesiasticae historiae, on the period from the origins of Christianity to the execution of the emperor-tyrant Phocas in 610; a lost appendix of five volumes continued the chronicle, summarizing events until the death in 912 of Emperor Leo VI (the Wise). Taking as a point of departure several celebrated ecclesiastical histories, including those of the 6th-century Byzantine Evagrius Scholasticus and the 4th-century Eusebius of Caesarea, integrated with accounts of an anonymous 10th-century text, Nicephorus produced a chronicle, the value of which must be determined by the quality of the individual sources used. In the manner of Byzantine humanism, the Ecclesiasticae historiae, written in an affected style that often impedes textual clarity, was dedicated to the emperor Andronicus II Palaeologus (1282–1328) and contributed to that monarch’s nationalist movement exalting Greek culture and Orthodoxy above Latin Christianity. The 16th-century Latin translation, however, served to support the argument for the use of religious images in controversies involving certain Protestant iconoclasts.
Among Nicephorus’s other works are commentaries on the writings of the outstanding patristic Greek theologian Gregory of Nazianzus and of the Byzantine monk John Climacus; treatises on the annual cycle of Byzantine worship, with annotations on Lenten and Easter hymnody; original liturgical orations in prose and poetry; rigid Byzantine verse forms cataloging emperors, patriarchs, and other dignitaries; and, as an exception, secular themes in verse and rhetorical forms.
