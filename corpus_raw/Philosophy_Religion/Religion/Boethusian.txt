Boethusian,   member of a Jewish sect that flourished for a century or so before the destruction of Jerusalem in ad 70. Their subsequent history is obscure, as is also the identity of Boethus, their founder. Because of evident similarities, some scholars tend to view the Boethusians as merely a branch of the Sadducees. Both parties, they point out, associated with the aristocracy and denied the immortality of the soul and the resurrection of the body, because neither of these doctrines was contained in the written Torah, or first five books of the Bible. The Boethusians testified to their disbelief in the “world to come” by living lives of luxury and by ridiculing the piety and asceticism of the Pharisees. The Talmud—the authoritative compendium of law, lore, and commentary—speaks of the Boethusians in derisive tones. Still other scholars have argued that the Boethusians should be identified with the Essenes and Dead Sea Sect and that the word Boethusian may not derive from the name Boethus but from Beth Essaya, or Essenes.
