Shema,   (Hebrew: “Hear”), the Jewish confession of faith made up of three scriptural texts (Deuteronomy 6:4–9, 11:13–21; Numbers 15:37–41), which, together with appropriate prayers, forms an integral part of the evening and morning services. The name derives from the initial word of the scriptural verse “Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord” (Deuteronomy 6:4). The time for recital was determined by the first two texts: “when you lie down, and when you rise.” The Shema texts are also chanted at other times during the Jewish liturgy. The biblical verses inculcate the duty to learn, to study, and to observe the Torah. These texts and their appropriate prayers are consequently sacred to Jews because they contain a profession of faith, a declaration of allegiance to the kingship and kingdom of God, and a symbolic representation of total devotion to the study of the Torah. Since, however, meditation on the Torah “night and day” was a practical impossibility, the Shema became a substitute for Torah study or, more exactly, the minimum requirement for observing the precept.
Following the example of the scholar-martyr Rabbi Akiba (2nd century ad), the Shema has been uttered by Jewish martyrs throughout the ages as their final profession of faith in the one God of humankind and their love for him. Pious Jews hope to die with the words of the Shema on their lips.
