Gsung-’bum, (Tibetan: “collected works”)  the collected writings of a Tibetan or Mongolian lama. These series of works represent an indigenous contribution to Buddhist thought, as distinguished from the numerous texts originating in India and collected in the canonical Bka’-’gyur and the supplementary Bstan-’gyur.
The writings of the lamas include commentaries on Indian texts together with essays on such topics as epistemology, ritual, and meditation.
