Letter of Paul to the Philippians, also called Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Philippians, abbreviation Philippians,  eleventh book of the New Testament, written by St. Paul the Apostle to the Christian congregation he had established in Philippi. It was penned while he was in prison, probably at Rome or Ephesus, about 62 ce. In its present canonical form, Philippians is, according to several scholars, a later collection of fragments of the correspondence(s) of Paul with the congregation in Philippi.
Apprehensive that his execution was close at hand, yet hoping somehow to visit the Philippians again, Paul explains that he was imprisoned for preaching the gospel of Christ. Though he welcomes death for Jesus’ sake, he is equally concerned to continue his apostolate. Paul exhorts his readers to remain steadfast in their faith and to imitate the humility of Christ, who “emptied himself” and “became obedient unto death, even death on a cross” (2:7–8). Exegetes generally believe that this much-quoted passage was taken from an early Christian hymn. Paul further urges the Philippians to work out their “own salvation with fear and trembling” (2:12), words often cited by theologians in discussing the role of free will in gaining personal salvation.
