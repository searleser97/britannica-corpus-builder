Wakan, also called Wakonda, orWakanda,  among various American Indian groups, a great spiritual power of supernatural origin belonging to some natural objects. Wakan may be conceived of as a weak or strong power; the weak powers can be ignored, but the strong ones must be placated. Poisonous plants and reptiles can contain wakan, as can intoxicating drinks. Wakan beings are the immortal supernatural powers who bestow wakan; they too may be weak or strong, but all are believed to enjoy music and pipe smoke. Wakan has no essential characteristics in itself; rather, it is a kind of holiness or wonderfulness inherent in some objects. Compare mana.
