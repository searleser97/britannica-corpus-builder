James Darmesteter,  (born March 28, 1849, Château-Salins, Fr.—died Oct. 19, 1894, Maisons-Laffitte), French scholar noted for ancient Iranian language studies, especially his English and French translations of the Avesta, the sacred scripture of Zoroastrianism.
Darmesteter’s thesis on Zoroastrian mythology (1875) was his first important work. He began teaching ancient Iranian at the École des Hautes Études (School of Advanced Studies), Paris, in 1877 and, continuing his research, published Études iraniennes (1883; “Iranian Studies”). Appointed professor at the Collège de France (1885), he traveled to India the following year and, upon his return, published a translation of Afghan songs and a valuable essay on Afghan language and literature. His English translation of the Avesta, prepared in collaboration with L.H. Mills, appeared in Sacred Books of the East (vol. 4, 23, and 31, 1883–87), edited by the Anglo-German Orientalist and linguist Max Müller. Darmesteter’s French translation, Le Zend-Avesta, 3 vol. (1892–93), was accompanied by a historical commentary. He placed the earliest portion of the extant Avestan texts in the 1st century bc but the bulk of them in the 3rd century ad. He also published the posthumous papers of his brother, Arsène, the French language scholar.
