Dutch Reformed Church in Africa, Afrikaans Nederduitse Gereformeerde Kerk In Afrika,  denomination formed in 1859 by the all-white Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa for its black African mission congregations. It has the same structure, doctrine, traditions, and customs as the mother church, which retains extensive control over it by supplying 80 percent of its budget. Its clergy may not serve white congregations; intercommunion between the two churches is prohibited even as a symbol of ecumenical unity. Leaders of the Dutch Reformed Church in Africa protest apartheid (separate development for the races) in church and society and have endorsed the World Alliance of Reformed Churches’ exclusion in 1982 of the mother church, an act that commits the daughter church eventually to the severance of all ties. The Dutch Reformed Church’s decision in 1989 to condemn apartheid averted an irreparable split between it and its African daughter church, however. The headquarters of the Dutch Reformed Church in Africa are in Bloemfontein, S.Af.
