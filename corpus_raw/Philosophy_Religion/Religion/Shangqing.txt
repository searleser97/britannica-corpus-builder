Shangqing, (Chinese: “Highest Purity” or “Supreme Clarity”) Wade-Giles romanization Shang-ch’ing,  important early sectarian movement associated with the emergence of Daoism during the southern Six Dynasties period (220–589 ce). The origins of the sect go back to the revelations made to Yang Xi in the 4th century, which were gathered together as an early corpus of scriptures (particularly important were the Huangting jing (“Scripture of the Yellow Court”) and the Datong jing (“Scripture of the Great Profundity”), emphasizing spiritual fulfillment through the mental and physiological practices of inner visualization and ecstatic journeying. Eventually the famed scholar Tao Hongjing collated these scriptures and established a religious centre on Mao Shan (Shangqing is also known as “Mao Shan Taoism”). Stressing ecstatic experience and the arduous achievement of becoming a xian, an “immortal,” this tradition was especially influential during the Tang dynasty (618–907) but gradually was absorbed into the Tianshidao (“Way of the Celestial Masters”) tradition.
