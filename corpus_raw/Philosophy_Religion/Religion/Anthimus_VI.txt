Anthimus VI, original name Joannides,  (born c. 1790, Kutali Island, Aegean Sea—died  1878, Kandilli, near present Istanbul), Eastern Orthodox patriarch of Constantinople who attempted to maintain his ecclesiastical authority over the rebellious Bulgarian Orthodox Church, and, with others, wrote an Orthodox encyclical letter repudiating Roman Catholic overtures toward reunion.
In about 1840 Anthimus, a monk of a monastery on Mt. Athos, in Greece, was chosen metropolitan of Ephesus, near modern Selçuk, Tur. He later became patriarch of Constantinople, reigning for three intervals: 1845–48, 1853–55, and 1871–73. The successive dismissals and reappointments of Anthimus to the patriarchate reflected the policy of the Turkish rulers of reacting sensitively to political events and of preventing the patriarchate from acquiring political strength.
Together with the patriarchs of Alexandria, Jerusalem, and Antioch, Anthimus wrote the Encyclical of the Patriarchs (1848), an open letter to the Orthodox world criticizing papal ambitions to exercise authority over the universal Catholic Church as represented in Pope Pius IX’s encyclical letter of Jan. 6, 1848, In Suprema Petri Apostoli Sede (“On the Supreme Throne of Peter the Apostle”), which invited the Orthodox Church to reunite with the church of Rome.
