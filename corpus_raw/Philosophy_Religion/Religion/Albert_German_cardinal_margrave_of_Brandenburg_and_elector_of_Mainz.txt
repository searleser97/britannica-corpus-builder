Albert, also called Albert of Brandenburg, German Albrecht von Brandenburg,  (born June 28, 1490—died  Sept. 24, 1545, Mainz [Germany]), margrave of Brandenburg, cardinal, and elector of Mainz, a liberal patron of the arts known chiefly as the object of the reformer Martin Luther’s attacks concerning the sale of indulgences.
Albert was the younger son of John Cicero, elector of Brandenburg. Albert became archbishop of Magdeburg and administrator of the bishopric of Halberstadt in 1513, and he became elector and archbishop of Mainz the following year. In order to gain the agreement of Pope Leo X to his holding more than one diocese, which was contrary to church law, Albert made a large contribution toward the rebuilding of St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome. These funds, borrowed from the banking house of Fugger, were to be repaid through the sale of indulgences, half the proceeds going to Albert, the other half to Leo X. Luther condemned this practice in his Ninety-five Theses.
In 1518 Albert was created cardinal. A religious liberal, he was a friend of the humanists Ulrich von Hutten and Desiderius Erasmus. Late in life Albert became less tolerant of Protestantism and helped foster the German Counter-Reformation.
