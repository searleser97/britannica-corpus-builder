Genesis Rabbah,  systematic exegesis of the book of Genesis produced by the Judaic sages about 450 ce, which sets forth a coherent and original account of that book. In Genesis Rabbah the entire narrative is formed so as to point toward the sacred history of Israel, meaning the Jewish people—their slavery and redemption; their coming Temple in Jerusalem; and their exile and salvation at the end of time. The deeds of the founders supply signals for the children about what is to come. So the biographies of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob also constitute a protracted account of Israel’s later history.
