Zbigniew Morsztyn,  (born c. 1628, Podgórze, near Kraków, Poland—died December 13, 1689, Königsberg, Prussia [now Kaliningrad, Russia]), Polish poet well known for his melancholy religious poetry.
A courtier of the princely Radziwiłł family, Morsztyn spent the years 1648–57 in the military service fighting against the Russians and the Swedish invasion; in 1662 he was forced to move to Prussian territory, where he devoted himself to politics and literature. Among his best-known works is Muza domowa (1676–84; “Domestic Muse”), a bitter account of his military experiences and the devastation of war.
