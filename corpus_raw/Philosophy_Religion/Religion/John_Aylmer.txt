John Aylmer,  (born 1521, Tivetshall St. Mary, Norfolk, Eng.—died  June 3, 1594, London), Anglican bishop of London in the reign of Elizabeth I, known for his vigorous enforcement of the Act of Uniformity (1559) within his Church of England diocese. His harsh treatment of all (whether Puritan or Roman Catholic) who differed with him on ecclesiastical questions caused him to be attacked in the anti-episcopal Marprelate Tracts (1588–89) and to be characterized as “Morrell,” the bad shepherd, in Edmund Spenser’s The Shepheardes Calender (1579).
Aylmer served as chaplain to Henry Grey (later the Duke of Suffolk) and as tutor to Grey’s daughter Lady Jane Grey. During Queen Mary’s vigorous restoration of Roman Catholicism, Aylmer, who had been given an archdeaconate in 1553, lost his post because of his opposition to the doctrine of transubstantiation. While living in exile in Strassburg and then in Zürich, he wrote a reply, entitled An Harborowe for Faithfull and Trewe Subjectes (1559), to John Knox’s famous First blast of the trumpet against the monstruous regiment of women. Knox had argued that by both natural law and revealed religion, women were unfit to rule. After the accession of the Protestant queen Elizabeth I, he returned to England.
Aylmer became archdeacon of Lincoln in 1562 and was appointed a member of the convocation that reformed and settled the doctrine and discipline of the Church of England. He was consecrated as bishop of London in 1577. His vindictiveness toward personal as well as doctrinal enemies aroused so much opposition that he attempted to be transferred to a quieter see. Although Elizabeth is thought to have considered such a move, he remained in London until his death.
