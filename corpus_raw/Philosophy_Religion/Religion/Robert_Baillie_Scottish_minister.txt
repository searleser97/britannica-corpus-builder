Robert Baillie,  (born 1599—died  July 1662, Glasgow), Presbyterian minister and theological scholar who led the movement in Scotland to reject (1637) the Church of England’s Book of Common Prayer. He was a member of the Glasgow Assembly (1638), at which the Church of Scotland broke away from English episcopacy. Baillie became professor of divinity at Glasgow (1642) and in 1661 was made principal of the university. His Letters and Journals, edited by D. Laing (1841–42), are of considerable historical importance.
