Norske folkeeventyr,  (1841–44; Eng. trans. Norwegian Folktales), collections of folktales and legends, by Peter Christen Asbjørnsen and Jørgen Engebretsen Moe, that had survived and developed from Old Norse pagan mythology in the mountain and fjord dialects of Norway. The authors, stimulated by a revival of interest in Norway’s past, gathered the tales of ghosts, fairies, gods, and mountain trolls and compiled them into a brilliant narration that preserved the oral feeling and distinctively Norwegian characteristics of the tales. In wisely choosing a linguistic middle ground against the largely imported Dano-Norwegian written language and the oral Norwegian dialects, Asbjørnsen and Moe came to set the standard for the Norwegian language known as Nynorsk (“new Norwegian”) in contradistinction to the more formal Bokmål (“book Norwegian”), though they also influenced the latter to some degree.
Asbjørnsen’s vivid prose sketches of folklife and Moe’s poems recaptured the folk heritage of Norway for the modern age. The Norske folkeeventyr stimulated further research into folktales and ballads and reawakened a sense of national identity.
