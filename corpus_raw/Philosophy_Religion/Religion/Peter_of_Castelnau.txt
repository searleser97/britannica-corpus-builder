Peter Of Castelnau, French Pierre De Castelnau,  (born, Château-Neuf, Montpellier, Fr.—died  Jan. 14, 1208, near Saint-Gilles, Fr.), Cistercian martyr, apostolic legate, and inquisitor against the Albigenses, most particularly the Cathari (heretical Christians who held unorthodox views on the nature of good and evil), whose assassination led to the Albigensian Crusade.
Peter became an archdeacon in 1199 and in 1202 joined the Cistercian order. In 1207 Pope Innocent III appointed Peter as apostolic legate and inquisitor to lead an expedition against the Albigenses and particularly to obtain the recantation of Count Raymond VI (q.v.) of Toulouse, who was allowing the heresy to spread throughout his domain. Having urged him from 1205 to stamp out the heretics, Peter now excommunicated Raymond, placing the Languedoc region under interdict, which aroused grave opposition. Peter’s campaign on behalf of Innocent ended in disaster. He was assassinated, supposedly at Raymond’s instigation, and in response to this act Innocent launched the Albigensian Crusade, a holy war in which Toulouse was ravaged and its inhabitants, Cathar and non-Cathar alike, were massacred. Peter’s relics were enshrined in the church of Saint-Gilles. He is venerated as a martyr in the dioceses of the Midi, in France.
