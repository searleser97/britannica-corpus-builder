Coyote,  in the mythology and folklore of the North American Plains, California, and Southwest Indians, the chief animal of the age before humans. Coyote’s exploits as a creator, lover, magician, glutton, and trickster are celebrated in a vast number of oral tales (see trickster tale). He was typically portrayed as a demiurge (independent creative force), as a maker of fateful decisions, as the being who secured for humans such necessities as fire and daylight, and as the originator of human arts. In all cases, his transgression of normative social boundaries frequently resulted in social or physical chaos, a situation resolved in each folktale’s conclusion.
Among the hundreds of tales in the Coyote cycles are a series in which Skunk and Coyote demonstrate their extraordinary incompetence as hunters; another in which Coyote tricks Porcupine out of a portion of buffalo meat, incurring Porcupine’s revenge; an incident in which Coyote is tricked into dumping his grandmother’s acorns into a river; and a tale of his transformation into a platter in order to be heaped with food to satisfy his voracious appetite.
For Northwest Coast Indians, Coyote’s analog was Raven. Among Northeast and Southeast Indians, Coyote was paralleled by the Great Hare, or Master Rabbit, whose adventures became a supplementary source for the Brer Rabbit folktales of Southern African Americans.
