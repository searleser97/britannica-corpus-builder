Smectymnuus,   acronym under which was published (1641) in England a book upholding the Presbyterian theory of the ministry in answer to the Anglican bishop Joseph Hall’s A Humble Remonstrance (1640–41). Hall replied to the Presbyterian attack. John Milton defended the Smectymnuus position in three tracts in 1641 and 1642. The Solemn League and Covenant in 1643 rendered the controversy moot. The name was derived from the initials of the book’s real authors, Stephen Marshall, Edmund Calamy, Thomas Young, Matthew Newcomen, and William Spurstowe. The adjective form “Smectymnuan” was later applied to the authors and to persons who accepted their views.
