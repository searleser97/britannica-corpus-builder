Jacob Isaac ben Asher Przysucha, also called Jacob Isaac of Przysucha, Przysucha also spelled Pshishkhah, byname Ha-Yehudi (“the Jew”), or Ha-Yehudi Ha-Kadosh (“the Holy Jew”),  (born 1776, Przedborz, Kingdom of Poland—died 1814, Przysucha), Jewish Ḥasidic leader who sought to turn Polish Ḥasidism away from its reliance on miracle workers. He advocated a new approach that combined study of the Torah with ardent prayer.
Przysucha was the descendant of a rabbinic family. He became learned in the Torah and was also known for his intense spirituality. For a time he was a disciple of Jacob Isaac Horowitz of Lublin, who was known as “the Seer.” Przysucha gradually established a new form of Ḥasidism, Pshishkhah Ḥasidism, based on his belief that the wholehearted observance of one’s duty as a Jew was of greater value than the performance of miracles, which he felt appealed to the ignorant and materialistic. Because Przysucha and his followers believed that prayer should be offered only when one felt close to God, they did not pray at fixed times, as required by religious law. This brought them into conflict with Ḥasids led by the Seer, and a breach developed between the two groups and between Przysucha and his former master.
