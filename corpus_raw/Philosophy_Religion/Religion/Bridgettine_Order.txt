Bridgettine, also spelled Brigittine, member of Order of the Most Holy Savior (O.SS.S.),  a religious order of cloistered nuns founded by St. Bridget of Sweden in 1344 and approved by Pope Urban V in 1370. Bridget believed that she was called by Christ to found a strictly disciplined religious order that would contribute to the reform of monastic life. She went to Rome to gain approval of her order and died there in 1373. Her foundation began to grow and contributed greatly to the culture of Scandinavia and Germany. The orderâ€™s celebrated Syon Abbey at Isleworth, Middlesex, was founded in 1415. Attached to each house was a monastery for monks who lived under the same rule and under the government of the abbess. At the time of the Protestant Reformation, the order was nearly destroyed when its houses were suppressed and confiscated.
The modern Sisters of the Most Holy Savior of St. Bridget, founded at Rome in 1911 by Mother Elisabeth Hasselblad, were recognized by the Holy See in 1942 as an offshoot of the ancient order. Its members are contemplatives whose prayer life is directed to the reunion of all Christians.
