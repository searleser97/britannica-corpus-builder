Theragāthā/Therīgāthā, (Sanskrit: “Hymns of the Elders/Senior Nuns”)  Buddhist lyrics, included in the Suttanipāta (one of the earliest books of the Pāli canon, appearing in the late Khuddaka Nikaya [“Short Collection”] of the Sutta Pitaka). In the works 264 monks speak of their inner experiences and of nature, and some 100 nuns tell of their daily lives. The songs of the monks are said to have been composed when their authors experienced the bliss of enlightenment. Within the collection about 30 different meters can be distinguished, attesting to the prosodic variety of Buddhist lyrics.
