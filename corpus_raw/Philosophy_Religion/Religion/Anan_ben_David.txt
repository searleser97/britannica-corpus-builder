Anan ben David,  (flourished 8th century), Persian Jew, founder of the Ananites, an antirabbinical order from which the still-existing Karaite religious movement developed.
Anan seems to have become prominent in the 760s ce, when he competed with his younger brother for the office of exilarch, head of the Jews of the Babylonian Exile. The office was a hereditary one, needing the confirmation of the ruling caliph, which Anan failed to obtain. He therefore declared himself antiexilarch, an action that caused him to be jailed by the civil authorities. At his trial Anan pleaded that the caliph had confirmed his brother as head of one religion but that he, Anan, had founded a new religion, one with similarities to Islam. As a result, he was released and given government protection.
In 770 Anan wrote the definitive code of his order, the Sefer ha-mitzwot (“Book of Precepts”). Its unifying principle is its rejection of much of the Talmud and of the rabbinate, which based its authority on the Talmud. Only the Bible is held to be valid, but it is interpreted with an unusual mixture of freedom and literalism.
After Anan’s death, his followers settled in Jerusalem. Eventually his movement developed into the order known as Karaism, which also was ascetically oriented and rejected Talmudic authority. When the State of Israel was founded in 1948, several thousand Karaites settled there.
