Arpad, also called Tall Rif øat,  ancient city in northwestern Syria. Arpad is frequently mentioned in the Old Testament and in Assyrian texts.
Coming under Assyrian influence in the 9th century bc, Arpad regained its independence in 754, and it successfully sided with Sardur II of Urartu until the Assyrian king Tiglath-pileser III defeated both Urartu and Arpad. Tiglath-pileser made Arpad the capital of a province that included the western half of northern Syria. After an unsuccessful revolt against Sargon II in 720 bc, the city remained loyal to Assyria.
