Johannes Magnus,  (born March 19, 1488, Linköping, Swed.—died  March 22, 1544, Rome), Roman Catholic archbishop and historian, one of the most distinguished scholars of his time, who was exiled as a consequence of the Reformation.
Brother of the ecclesiastic Olaus Magnus, author of a celebrated history of Scandinavia, Johannes was made papal emissary to Scandinavia by Pope Adrian VI, his former teacher at the Catholic University of Leuven (Louvain), Belg. In 1523 he investigated the dispute between the new Swedish king, Gustav I Vasa, and Archbishop Trolle of Uppsala, Swed., who was accused of supporting the claim of King Christian II of Denmark to the Swedish throne. In 1524 Pope Clement VII made Magnus administrator of the Uppsala archdiocese, but he was subsequently arrested and exiled amidst Gustav’s conflicts with the papacy during the period when Sweden was veering toward Lutheranism. The Magnus brothers lived in Danzig, Pol., and, from 1541, in Rome. In 1533 Johannes was made archbishop of Uppsala, but he never lived in his see. His Historia de omnibus gothorum sueonumque regibus (1555; “History Concerning All the Gothic and Swedish Kings”) is the primary source for the history of several Scandinavian kings.
