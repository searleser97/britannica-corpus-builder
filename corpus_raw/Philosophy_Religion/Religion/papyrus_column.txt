Papyrus column,  in Egyptian religion, amulet that conveyed freshness, youth, vigour, and the continuance of life to its wearer. The amulet, made of glazed ware or various types of stone, was shaped like a papyrus stem and bud. Its significance was perhaps derived from its ideographic value (Egyptian wadj ‘green, fresh, vigorous’), for, just as the plant itself was vigorous and growing, so also would the wearer of the papyrus column amulet possess these qualities.
