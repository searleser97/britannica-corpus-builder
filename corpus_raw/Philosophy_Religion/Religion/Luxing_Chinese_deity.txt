Luxing, Wade-Giles romanization Lu Hsing,  in Chinese mythology, one of three stellar gods known collectively as Fulushou. He was honoured as a deity who could make people happy through increased salaries or promotions that brought prosperity (lu).
In life, Luxing was a scholar who bore the name Shi Fen. In the 2nd century bc he was a favourite of Emperor Jing and was made a high official at the royal court. His family prospered through imperial generosity. Perhaps because the Chinese have many gods of wealth and happiness, Luxing is not nearly so widely honoured as is Shouxing, the god of longevity.
