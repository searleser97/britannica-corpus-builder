Thomas Emlyn,  (born May 27, 1663, Stamford, Lincolnshire, Eng.—died  July 30, 1741, London), English Presbyterian minister and writer who first publicly adopted the name Unitarian to designate a liberal, rational approach to God as a single person (as opposed to Christian belief in the Trinity).
Emlyn began preaching before he was 20. He served as a private chaplain to two aristocratic households in England and Ireland (1683–90) and in 1690 became pastor of a Presbyterian congregation in Dublin. In 1702 he was expelled by the Dublin presbytery after publishing An Humble Inquiry into the Scripture Account of Jesus Christ. In 1703 he was tried for blasphemy and sentenced to a year’s imprisonment and a large fine. The rest of his life was spent mainly in London, where he preached to a few followers. In 1790 extracts from An Humble Inquiry were published in America, where they influenced New England Unitarianism.
