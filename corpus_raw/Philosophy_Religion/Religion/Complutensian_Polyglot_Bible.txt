Complutensian Polyglot Bible,  the first and best known polyglot Bible in which the text was presented in several languages in adjacent columns. The Old Testament in the Complutensian contained a revised Masoretic Hebrew text and translations in Aramaic (the Targum of Onkelos), Latin (the Vulgate), and Greek (the Lucianic recension of the Septuagint, printed in full for the first time). The Complutensian New Testament presented the original Greek version together with the Latin translation. It was prepared at the University of Alcalá de Henares, in Spain, by a group of scholars under the sponsorship of Cardinal Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros and printed (probably 600 copies) in 1514–17. With the authorization of Pope Leo X, the work was published in 1521 or 1522.
