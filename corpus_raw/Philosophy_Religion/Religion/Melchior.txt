Melchior,  legendary figure, said to be one of the Magi who paid homage to the infant Jesus. Although their names are not recorded in the biblical account, the names of three Magi—Bithisarea, Melichior, and Gathaspa—appeared in a chronicle known as the Excerpta latina barbari in about the 8th century; they have become known most commonly as Balthasar, Melchior, and Gaspar (or Casper). According to Western church tradition, Melchior is often represented as a king of Persia and is usually said to have given the gift of gold to the Christ Child. In art he is frequently depicted as the oldest of the three Magi, often with a long white beard. The three named Magi are venerated as saints and martyrs and are celebrated on the Feast of the Epiphany in the West.
