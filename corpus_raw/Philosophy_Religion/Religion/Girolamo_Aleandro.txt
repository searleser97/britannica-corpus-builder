Girolamo Aleandro, Dutch Hieronymus Aleander,  (born Feb. 13, 1480, Motta di Treviso, near Venice—died  Feb. 1, 1542, Rome), cardinal and Humanist who was an important opponent of the Lutheran Reformation.
A remarkable scholar, particularly of classical languages, Aleandro was in his youth closely associated with the Dutch Humanist Erasmus. He lectured at Venice, Orléans (France), and Paris, where he was appointed rector of the university.
In 1520 Pope Leo X sent him to Germany to lead the opposition against Martin Luther at the Diet of Worms, an effort that brought about his break with Erasmus. The edict against Luther, which was adopted by the Diet, was drawn up and proposed by Aleandro, and in Brussels it was Aleandro who was responsible for the death of the first martyrs of the Reformation. In 1523 Clement VII sent him as nuncio to the court of Francis I of France, with whom he was taken prisoner at the Battle of Pavia (1525). He was later employed on various papal missions, especially to Germany, but was unable to check the progress of the new doctrines. He was created cardinal in 1538 by Paul III.
Aleandro’s chief work is his unfinished treatise De habendo Concilio, setting forth his views on the Council of Trent, of which he was an ardent supporter. This and other documents of Aleandro in the Vatican Library, relating to his opposition to Luther, were used in Sforza Pallavicino’s Istoria del Concilio Tridentino (1656; “History of the Council of Trent”).
