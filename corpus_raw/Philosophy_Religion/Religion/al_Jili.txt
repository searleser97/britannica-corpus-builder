Al-Jīlī, in full ʿAbd al-Karīm Quṭb al-Dīn ibn Ibrāhīm al-Jīlī,  (born 1365—died c. 1424), mystic whose doctrines of the “perfect man” became popular throughout the Islamic world.
Little is known about al-Jīlī’s personal life. Possibly after a visit to India in 1387, he studied in Yemen during 1393–1403. Of his more than 30 works, the most famous is Al-Insān al-kāmil fi maʿrifat al-awākhir wa al-awā ʿil (partial Eng. trans., Studies in Islamic Mysticism), which contains his complex doctrine of the perfect man. The work shows clearly the influence of the pantheistic Spanish mystic Ibn al-ʿArabī (d. 1240).
Al-Jīlī maintained that the perfect man can achieve unity with the Divine Being. This unity is experienced not only by the prophets, from Adam to Muhammad, but also by others who reach the highest level of being (wujūd) and become, as it were, the most select of the select. At this level, all contradictions, such as being with non-being, and vengeance with mercy, are resolved. Al-Jīlī also maintained that in every age the perfect man manifested the outward appearance and inner essences of the Prophet Muhammad. The perfect man was thereby a channel through which the community could enjoy contact with the Divine Being. Al-Jīlī claimed that, in the town of Zabīd in Yemen in 1393, he had met the Prophet Muhammad, who then manifested himself through al-Jīlī as sheikh, or spiritual leader.
Al-Jīlī’s doctrine of the perfect man later degenerated into a belief that all holy men and mystics were able to achieve contact and unity with God.
