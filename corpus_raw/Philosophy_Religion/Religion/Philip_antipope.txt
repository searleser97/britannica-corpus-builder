Philip,  (flourished  8th century, Italy), antipope in July 768. Temporal rulers coveted the papal throne following the death (767) of Pope St. Paul I, and Toto, duke of Nepi, had his brother Constantine II, a layman, elected pope. The Lombard king Desiderius then sent troops to Rome, killing Toto and deposing Constantine. Backed by some Romans, the Lombards, in 768, secretly set Philip up as pope. Philip had been a monk in the monastery of St. Vito. He was ejected, however, and Stephen III (IV) was elected pope on Aug. 1, 768, at which time Philip retired to his monastery.
