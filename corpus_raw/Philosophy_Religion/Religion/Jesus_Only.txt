Jesus Only,  movement of believers within Pentecostalism who hold that true baptism can only be “in the name of Jesus” rather than in the name of the Trinity. It began at a Pentecostal camp meeting in California in 1913 when one of the participants, John G. Scheppe, experienced the power of the name of Jesus. Many accepted his revelation, and they found support for their belief in “Jesus Only” baptism in John 3:5 and Acts 2:38. This led to the denial of the traditional doctrine of the Trinity and to the assertion that Jesus is the one Person in the Godhead. The theological controversy split the Pentecostals and led to the establishment of new churches. See also Pentecostal Assemblies of the World, Inc.; United Pentecostal Church, Inc.
