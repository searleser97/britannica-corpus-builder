Guillaume Briçonnet,  (born c. 1472—died  Jan. 24, 1534, Saint-Germain-des-Prés, France), influential Roman Catholic reformer, one of the most energetic personalities in the French church at the beginning of the Reformation.
Briçonnet was the son of King Charles VIII’s counsellor Guillaume Briçonnet (1445–1514), who after his wife’s death took holy orders and became bishop of Saint-Malo, archbishop of Reims, archbishop of Narbonne, and cardinal. The younger Briçonnet was made bishop of Lodève (1489), abbot of Saint-Germain-des-Prés (1507), and bishop of Meaux (1516). He took part in the Council of Pisa in 1511 and was entrusted by Francis I of France in 1516 with the negotiations in Rome over the application of the Concordat of Bologna.
It is thought that the influence of some Italian bishops of the Oratory of the Divine Love—particularly Gian Matteo Giberti, bishop of Verona—prompted Briçonnet to begin reforms in his diocese of Meaux, where he made frequent visitations, encouraged devotion to the Blessed Sacrament and to the Virgin Mary, and promoted a religious revival by means of sermons and tracts printed in his own palace.
Briçonnet, moreover, was the leader of the Meaux group of evangelicals, which included Jacques Lefèvre d’Étaples, Gérard Roussel, Guillaume Farel, Jodocus Clichtove, François Vatable, and Martial Mazurier. The group combined humanism with a return to the study of the Bible and, especially, of St. Paul’s letters as the primary source of Christian doctrine. Its members, however, differed in their attitude toward Lutheranism, which Briçonnet condemned. Even so, Briçonnet had to appear twice before the Paris Parlement on suspicion of heresy. The group was finally dispersed about 1525.
