ʿAbd Allāh ibn al-ʿAbbās, also called Ibn Abbās, byname Al-ḥibr (“the Doctor”), or Al-baḥr (“the Sea”),  (born c. 619—died 687/688, aṭ-Ṭāʾif, Arabia), a Companion of the prophet Muḥammad, one of the greatest scholars of early Islām, and the first exegete of the Qurʾān.
In the early struggles for the caliphate, Ibn ʿAbbās supported ʿAlī and was rewarded with the governorship of Baṣra. Subsequently he defected and withdrew to Mecca. During the reign of Muʿāwiyah he lived in the Hejaz, but frequently travelled to Damascus, the capital. After the death of Muʿāwiyah, he opposed ʿIbn az-Zubayr, whom he refused to recognize as caliph, and was forced to flee to aṭ-Ṭāʾif, where he died.
Ibn ʿAbbas is renowned for his knowledge of both sacred and profane tradition and for his critical interpretations of the Qurʾān. From his youth he gathered information concerning the words and deeds of Muḥammad from other Companions and gave classes on interpretation of the Qurʾān, his commentaries on which were later collected.
