Pillar of Fire,   a white Holiness church of Methodist antecedence that was organized (1901) in Denver, Colo., U.S., as the Pentecostal Union by Alma Bridwell White, who married a Methodist minister. Her evangelistic fervour brought opposition from Methodist officials, which led to her withdrawal from the Methodist Church. In 1917 the church was renamed Pillar of Fire, and she was ordained bishop.
The church stresses holiness and sanctification by prayer and generally follows Methodist teachings. Women can occupy any ministerial office. The Pillar of Fire maintains several schools and conducts missions in Liberia. Headquarters, teacher-training facilities, and a publishing house are located in Zarephath, N.J., U.S.
