Pramana-varttika, (Sanskrit: “Commentary on Valid Knowledge”)  perhaps the foremost work on Buddhist logic and epistemology, written in the 7th century. The Pramana-varttika is the chief work of Dharmakirti, originally a southern Indian Brahman.
The Pramana-varttika is written in about 2,000 stanzas of mnemonic verse, and its four chapters deal, respectively, with inference, valid knowledge, sense perception, and syllogism. Composed as comprehensive commentaries on an earlier work by Dignaga, Dharmakirti’s treatises in turn stimulated a great number of commentaries and have become the standard works in their field, especially in Tibet.
