Letter of James, also called Epistle of St. James the Apostle, abbreviation James,  New Testament writing addressed to the early Christian churches (“to the twelve tribes in the dispersion”) and attributed to James, a Christian Jew, whose identity is disputed. There is also wide disagreement as to the date of composition, though many scholars hold that it was probably post-apostolic and was likely penned at the turn of the 1st century. Under that assumption, neither St. James, son of Zebedee, who died as a martyr before 44 ce, nor St. James, the Lord’s Brother, whose martyrdom is reported as c. 62 ce, could have authored the epistle. Thus, the Letter of James is usually understood to be pseudepigraphical, with the purpose of gaining apostolic authority for its needed message. The epistle is one of the seven so-called Catholic Letters (i.e., James, 1 and 2 Peter, 1, 2, and 3 John, and Jude) that were among the last of the literature to be settled on as canonical before the agreement of East and West in 367. The canonical order of these works has varied throughout history, though the Letter of James is usually placed as the 20th book in the New Testament canon.
The letter is moralistic rather than dogmatic and reflects early Jewish Christianity. The writer covers such topics as endurance under persecution, poverty and wealth, control of the tongue, care for orphans and widows, cursing, boasting, oaths, and prayer. The passage that stresses the importance of faith with good works (“So faith by itself, if it has no works, is dead.” 2:17) has been troublesome for theologians like Martin Luther who deny human participation in the process of salvation. Luther famously called the Letter of James “the epistle of straw.” The book also features the only New Testament reference to anointing of the sick (5:14), which is cited, mostly by Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox theologians, as a probable reference to what they consider one of the seven sacraments.
