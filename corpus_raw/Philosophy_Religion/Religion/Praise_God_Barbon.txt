Praise-God Barbon,  Barbon also spelled Barebone, or Barebones, Praise-God  also spelled Praisegod,  (born c. 1596—died  1679, London), English sectarian preacher from whom the Cromwellian Barebones Parliament derived its nickname.
By 1634 Barbon was becoming a prosperous leather seller and was attracting attention as the minister of a congregation that assembled at his own house, the “Lock and Key,” on Fleet Street. His preaching, in which he advocated infant baptism, was attended by large audiences and was sometimes the occasion of riots. After Oliver Cromwell had dissolved the Long Parliament, Barbon was summoned by Cromwell to sit as a member for London in the new assembly of “godly” men who were nominated by the Independent congregations. This “Nominated Parliament” (July–December 1653), also derisively nicknamed the “Barebones Parliament” after Barbon, consisted predominantly of strict Puritans. Barbon himself played no significant role, though he did support radical legal reforms. In the 1650s he was active in the London Common Council.
Opposing the restoration of Charles II, Barbon presented in February 1660 a petition to Parliament deprecating any reconciliation with the Stuarts. He also circulated Marchamont Needham’s pamphlet detailing anecdotes critical of Charles II’s morals. After the Restoration (May 1660), Barbon publicly opposed the government and was imprisoned in the Tower of London (Nov. 26, 1661, to July 27, 1662) for his rashness.
Called a Brownist and an Anabaptist by his opponents, Barbon displayed in his writings a toleration unusual in a period of much acrimonious religious controversy.
