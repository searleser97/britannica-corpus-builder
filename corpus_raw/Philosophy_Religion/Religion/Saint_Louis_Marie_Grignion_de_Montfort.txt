Saint Louis-Marie Grignion de Montfort,  (born Jan. 31, 1673, Montfort-sur-Meu, Fr.—died April 28, 1716, St. Laurent-sur-Sèvre; canonized 1947; feast day April 28), French priest who promoted the devotion to the Virgin Mary and who founded the religious congregations of the Daughters of Wisdom and the Company of Mary (Montfort Fathers).
Ordained priest in 1700 at Paris, Montfort went to the French town of Nantes as a rural preacher and then to Poitiers, where he reorganized a hospital for the poor and began the Daughters of Wisdom, a congregation dedicated to the care of needy children and the sick. In 1705 he founded the Montfort Fathers to continue his mission and retreat work and to spread devotion to Mary. Named apostolic missionary for France (1706) by Pope Clement XI, he spent the rest of his life preaching parish missions in western France.
Montfort is well known for his True Devotion to the Blessed Virgin, which teaches that devotion to Mary is the best means of attaining union with Christ. The discovery in 1842 of True Devotion gave the Montfort Fathers considerable impetus: in 1853 they were raised to the status of a pontifical congregation, and Montfort’s beatification in 1888 reinforced the congregation’s international expansion.
