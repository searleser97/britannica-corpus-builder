The War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness, Hebrew Megillat Milḥamat B’ne, orBeb’ne Ḥoshekh, also called War Rule, orWar Scroll,  a Dead Sea Scroll, and one of the most important documents of the Essene sect of Jews that established a community at Qumrān in the Judaean desert during the first half of the 2nd century bc. The Essenes thought themselves to be the holy elect of Israel, the Sons of Light, who would at the end of time engage in a catastrophic war with the enemies of Israel, the Sons of Darkness.
The War Rule, discovered in Cave I of Qumrān in 1947, is a manual for military organization and strategy, including detailed specifications for battle gear and signals. It is also a theological discourse that develops the doctrine of the spirits of truth and perversity mentioned in the sect’s Manual of Discipline. The scroll’s apocalyptic portrayal of a 40-year “holy war” between the forces of good and evil involves heavenly as well as earthly soldiers. The elect of Israel are joined by an angelic host, while the devil and the evil angels fight alongside other nations of the Earth. The victory of the forces of light was to signal the final destruction of evil, after which the God of Israel would rule eternally in justice.
Most scholars identify the enemy “Kittim” of the scroll as Romans, who invaded and occupied Judaea in 63 bc. If this is so, the major sections of the scroll (probably a composite work) were written after that date but before ad 68, when the Qumrān community was disbanded because of the Jewish revolt of ad 66–70.
