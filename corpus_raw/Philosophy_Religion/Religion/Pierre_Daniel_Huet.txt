Pierre-Daniel Huet,  Huet also spelled Huetius,  (born Feb. 8, 1630, Caen, France—died  Jan. 26, 1721, Paris), French scholar, antiquary, scientist, and bishop whose incisive skepticism, particularly as embodied in his cogent attacks on René Descartes, greatly influenced contemporary philosophers.
After studying mathematics with the Jesuits, Huet visited the court of Queen Christina of Sweden in 1652. His discovery in the Swedish royal library of some fragments of a commentary on St. Matthew by the Greek theologian Origen (c. ad 185–c. 254) led to an edition of Origen in 1668.
From 1670 Huet assisted the French bishop Jacques Bossuet, tutor to the dauphin Louis, son of Louis XIV. He took holy orders in 1676 and served as bishop of Avranches for 10 years (1689–99) before retiring to the abbey of Fontenay, near Caen.
In addition to scientific work in the fields of astronomy, anatomy, and mathematics, Huet wrote a number of philosophical works that asserted the fallibility of human reason, among which were the influential polemics Censura Philosophiae Cartesianae (1689; “Criticisms of the Philosophy of Descartes”) and Nouveaux memoires pour servir a l’histoire (1692; “New Memoirs in the Service of History”). In these works he attempted to refute such Cartesian first principles as “Cogito ergo sum” (“I think, therefore I am”) and the “clear and distinct” test for the truth of an idea. These refutations were made in the service of Huet’s belief that truth is known ultimately only through faith rather than by reason, a philosophy known as fideism.
