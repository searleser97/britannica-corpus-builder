Hosanna,  in modern speech and liturgical usage, a cry of praise to God. It has acquired this meaning through the assumption that it was so meant by the multitude that hailed Jesus on Palm Sunday (Mark 11:9). If it was, it must already have become a Jewish liturgical cry rather far removed from its original meaning—the word is a Greek transliteration of the Hebrew hôshîʿah-nnaʾ “Save, (we) beseech Thee!” It meant, thus, entreaty, not praise (as in Psalms 118:25). If the crowd still knew its original meaning, they must have been addressing it to Jesus as the new David, as a plea for political salvation.
