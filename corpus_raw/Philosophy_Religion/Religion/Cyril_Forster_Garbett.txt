Cyril Forster Garbett,  (born Feb. 6, 1875, Tongham, Surrey, Eng.—died  Dec. 31, 1955, York, Yorkshire), archbishop of York and ecclesiastical writer who promoted a social conscience among the membership of the Church of England by his reports on the human misery in the areas he administered as bishop, particularly London’s Southwark district (1919–32).
Educated at Keble College, Oxford, Garbett was curate (1900–09) and vicar (1909–19) of a then-important Portsmouth parish before becoming bishop of Southwark (1919–32). There he restored discipline, built churches, and drew public attention to the evils of slums. Transferred to Winchester (1932–42), he felt the scope inadequate to his energies and chief interests. In 1942 he became archbishop of York, in which office his common sense, careful preparation of speeches, and gift for expressing in simple language the thoughts of laymen on matters of social, political, and religious interest made him a national figure. His books of this period, The Claims of the Church of England (1947), Church and State in England (1950), In an Age of Revolution (1952), and The Church of England Today (1953), provided a balanced account of his church.
