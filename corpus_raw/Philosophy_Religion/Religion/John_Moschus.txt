John Moschus,  (born c. 540–550, probably Damascus, Syria—died 619 or 634, Rome [Italy], or Constantinople, Byzantine Empire), Byzantine monk and writer whose work Pratum spirituale (“The Spiritual Meadow”), describing monastic spiritual experiences throughout the Middle East, became a popular example of ascetic literature during the medieval period and was a model for similar works.
Moschus began his monastic life at St. Theodosius Monastery near Jerusalem about 565. After observing monastic practices among hermits along the Jordan River, followed by sojourns in Egypt, the Sinai Desert, Cyprus, and Antioch, he spent time in Rome. Many scholars believe he then traveled to Constantinople (now Istanbul), but this is debated. He composed a personal narrative of his monastic encounters, augmenting it from other sources. Pratum spirituale contains more than 300 tales of religious practices in simple language, replete with details of the life and beliefs of the times. Abounding in reports of miracles and spiritual ecstasies and lacking any critical standards, it nevertheless provides singular data on the modes of worship and ceremonies in 6th- and 7th-century monasticism, devotion to the Virgin Mary, political circumstances (including accounts of Persian and Arabic invasions), and criticism of prevailing heresies.
