Asmodeus, Hebrew Ashmedai,  in Jewish legend, the king of demons. According to the apocryphal book of Tobit, Asmodeus, smitten with love for Sarah, the daughter of Raguel, killed her seven successive husbands on their wedding nights. Following instructions given to him by the angel Raphael, Tobias overcame Asmodeus and married Sarah.
The Talmud relates that Solomon captured the demon and pressed him into slave labour during the construction of the First Temple of Jerusalem. Other Haggadic legends depict Asmodeus as a more beneficent figure.
