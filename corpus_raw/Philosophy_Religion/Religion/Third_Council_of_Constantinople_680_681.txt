Third Council of Constantinople,  (680–681), the sixth ecumenical council of the Christian church, summoned by the emperor Constantine IV and meeting at Constantinople. The council condemned the monothelites, among them Pope Honorius I, and asserted two wills and two operations of Christ.
Monothelites were largely Eastern Christians who, forbidden to talk of the monophysite concept of a single nature of Christ, thought to enforce the unity of the person of Christ by proposing that Christ had one will (thelēma) and one operation (energeia) from his two natures. Sergius, patriarch of Constantinople, and Honorius I, pope of Rome, appear to have embraced the monothelite doctrine and were otherwise orthodox in their beliefs.
