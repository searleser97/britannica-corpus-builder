Richard le Grant, also called Richard Grant or Richard of Wethershed,  (died Aug. 3, 1231, San Gemini, Duchy of Spoleto [Italy]), 45th archbishop of Canterbury (1229–31), who asserted the independence of the clergy and of his see from royal control.
Richard was the chancellor of Lincoln Cathedral (1221–29), Lincolnshire. He was then appointed archbishop by Pope Gregory IX at the request of King Henry III of England and the English bishops and was consecrated on June 10. He soon disputed with Henry over a tax on the clergy, who, he argued, were not bound by secular rules and should not participate in secular affairs.
Soon after this dispute, Henry entrusted the chief justiciar, Hubert de Burgh, one of the greatest professional administrators of the time, with Tunbridge Castle. Richard, upholding his metropolitan rights, said Tunbridge belonged to his see and appealed to the king, who rejected his claim. He then excommunicated all those, except Henry, in possession of the land and castle, and in the spring of 1231 he took his case to Rome. Gregory decided in favour of Richard, but the archbishop died at the convent of the Friars Minor, in San Gemini, on his way home. Hubert was spuriously charged with having poisoned him.
