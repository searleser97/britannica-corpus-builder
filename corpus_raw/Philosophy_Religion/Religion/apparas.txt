Äppäräs, Finnish äpärä,  in Sami religion and folklore, the ghost of a dead child that haunts the place of its death because it did not receive proper burial rites. The äppäräs is only one of several of the anomalous dead figures in Finno-Ugric mythology that serve as warnings for the living to observe the norms of society or expect supernatural intervention. The äppäräs was most often thought of as the restless soul of an illegitimate child murdered by its mother. Other placeless or wandering dead, such as the Finnish ihtiriekko and the Ostyak vylep or patshak, often manifest themselves in apparitions or as auditory experiences, indicating the uneasiness of the people about the proper fate of their dead. The Sami rawga and Finnish raukka or meriraukka, most likely from old Scandinavian draugr, are similar ghosts, in this case people who perished at sea and thus received no proper burial.
