Hebrew Union College–Jewish Institute of Religion (HUC-JIR), formerly Hebrew Union College,  the oldest Jewish seminary in the United States for the training of rabbis, long a stronghold of American Reform Judaism. It was founded as the Hebrew Union College in 1875 at Cincinnati, Ohio, by Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise, and it later merged (1950) with the Jewish Institute of Religion.
Wise emigrated to the United States in 1846, at which time the country reportedly had only one ordained officiating rabbi. Realizing the need for a Jewish institution of higher learning, he oversaw the establishment of the Hebrew Union College. The first class graduated in 1883, and the college became the major training centre for rabbis and teachers of the Reform movement. In 1950 it merged with the Jewish Institute of Religion of New York, which was founded (1922) by Rabbi Stephen S. Wise. The California school of the college-institute was chartered at Los Angeles in 1954. A fourth campus was opened in Jerusalem in 1963 as a postdoctoral institution, though in subsequent years its mission was expanded to include various other programs.
The Klau Library at Cincinnati has one of the most extensive compilations of Hebraica and Judaica in the United States, including outstanding collections on Benedict de Spinoza, Jewish sacred music, and Jewish Americana. The Hebrew Union College Museum (now Skirball Museum) was established in 1913. HUC-JIR’s publications include the Hebrew Union College Annual and Studies in Bibliography and Booklore.
