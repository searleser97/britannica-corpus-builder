Yili, (Chinese: “Ceremonies and Rituals”) Wade-Giles romanization I-li,  the “Book of Ritual,” a collection of Chinese rituals probably compiled during the Western Han dynasty (206 bce–8 ce) and listed, along with two other ritual texts (Liji, “Record of Rites”; Zhouli, “Rites of Zhou”), among the Confucian classics. Its subject matter is somewhat different from the other ritual classics in that it gives special emphasis to such events as weddings, funerals, religious sacrifices, festivals, and official audiences.
