Ieronymos II, original name Ioannis Liapis,  (born 1938, Oinofyta, Greece), archbishop of Athens and all Greece (from 2008) and head of the Orthodox Church of Greece.
Liapis first pursued an academic career. He earned degrees in theology and philosophy from the University of Athens and did postgraduate work in Austria and Germany. He was an assistant to the head of the Archeological Society of Athens and taught in high schools in Athens and its suburbs. He was ordained a deacon and presbyter in 1967 and assumed the position of coadjutor metropolitan of Thebes and Livadia, which he held until 1978. He also served as abbot of two monasteries (1971–81) and as secretary and then chief secretary of the Holy Synod of the Church of Greece (1978–81). In 1981 he was elected metropolitan of Thebes and Livadia, serving until his election as archbishop in 2008.
As metropolitan, Ieronymos renovated a number of monasteries and convents and published numerous works on theological and historical topics. He promoted social welfare programs, establishing soup kitchens, orphanages, shelters for the elderly, a drug-treatment centre, and other charitable institutions in his diocese. As a former academic, Ieronymos cultivated scholarly ties between the Viotia History and Culture Research Centre, founded at his initiative, and the Universities of Cambridge and Durham.
Ieronymos was elected archbishop on Feb. 7, 2008, after a relatively short conclave and was expected to be less controversial than his outspoken predecessor Christodoulos. Ieronymos seemed less likely to involve himself in Greek political life and was on good terms with Bartholomew I, the ecumenical patriarch of Constantinople (Christodoulos often disagreed with the patriarch over matters of jurisdiction). Nevertheless, Ieronymos indicated that he would maintain many of the policies of Christodoulos, including efforts to strengthen ties with the Roman Catholic Church.
