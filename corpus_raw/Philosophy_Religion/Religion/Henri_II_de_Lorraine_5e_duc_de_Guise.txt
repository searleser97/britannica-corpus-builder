Henri II de Lorraine, 5e duke de Guise,  (born April 4, 1614, Blois, France—died June 2, 1664), duke of Guise whose multiple attempts to revive the family’s power came to naught.
Henri had already succeeded to the archbishopric of Rheims, a family benefice, when the death of his elder brother Charles, the 4th duke, made him head of the family, and in 1640 5th duke. He went against the absolutism of the age and joined the count of Soissons. Condemned to lose his head, he fled to Brussels and took command of the Austrian troops against France—noble traitors to their country being then not uncommon. In 1643, however, after Richelieu’s death, he returned to France; but, being chosen their chief by the Neapolitans, at the time of Masaniello’s revolt, and dazzled by this opening for his ambition, he betook himself to Naples. There his failure was complete; he was defeated and carried prisoner to Madrid. Delivered thence by the intercession of the Great Condé, he again attempted Naples and failed again. After this he spent the rest of his life at the French court and died in 1664 leaving no issue.
Henri’s sisters never married, and of all his brothers, only one left a son, Louis-Joseph de Lorraine (1650–71), who became 6th duke of Guise. Louis-Joseph died of smallpox in 1671, leaving an infant son, Francis-Joseph (1670–75), 7th duke, a sickly babe, with whom, four years later, the direct line of the house of Guise expired.
