Jón Arason,  (born 1484, Eyjafjördur, Ice.—died  Nov. 7, 1550, Skálholt), poet and last Roman Catholic bishop in Iceland, remembered as a national as well as a religious hero.
The son of poor parents, he rose quickly to eminence in the church and was consecrated bishop of Hólar, the northern diocese of Iceland, in 1522. He administered his diocese prosperously until Christian III of Denmark began to impose Lutheranism on all his subjects. The two Icelandic bishops, Jón in the north and Ögmundr in the south, protested (1537). Ögmundr was deported by the Danes in 1541, but Jón continued his resistance. He captured the Lutheran bishop Marteinn and seized his see (1549–50) but was soon afterward taken by the King’s agents and beheaded with two of his sons. Jón was the author of splendid religious and satirical poetry; he brought the first printing press to Iceland. His life was the subject of novels and plays by later Icelandic writers.
