Saint Soter,  (born, Fondi, Latium [Italy]—died c. 175, Rome; feast day April 22), pope from about 166 to about 175.
Succeeding St. Anicetus as pope, Soter sent a letter and alms to the church of Corinth, whose bishop, St. Dionysius, replied in a letter that acknowledged Soter’s affection and theological advice. Soter continued Pope Anicetus’ attack against Montanism, a heresy overemphasizing prophecy and rigid moral norms. Although no account of Soter’s death survives, he is honoured as a martyr.
