Hou Ji, Wade-Giles romanizationHou Chi,  in Chinese mythology, Lord of Millet Grains, who was worshipped for the abundant harvests that he graciously provided for his people. The Chinese honoured him not only for past favours but in the hope that devotion to the deity would guarantee continued blessings. An old tradition explained that Hou Ji was miraculously conceived when his childless mother stepped on the toeprint of a god. The child, reared in a forest by birds and animals, served as minister of agriculture in prehistoric times. Sacrifices in his honour were offered by rulers of the Xia dynasty (22nd–19th/18th century bce) and of the later Zhou dynasty (600–255 bce), which claimed him as their ancestor.
