Cotys, also called Cotytto,  Thracian goddess worshipped with orgiastic rites, especially at night. Her worship was apparently adopted publicly in Corinth (c. 425 bc) and in Dorian Sicily and perhaps privately in Athens about the same time; it then included a baptismal ceremony. Later relief sculptures from Thrace showed her as a huntress-goddess similar to Artemis, but in literature she was instead compared with the Oriental-Greek-Roman Cybele (Great Mother of the Gods).
