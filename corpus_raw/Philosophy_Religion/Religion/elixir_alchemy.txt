Elixir,   in alchemy, substance thought to be capable of changing base metals into gold. The same term, more fully elixir vitae, “elixir of life,” was given to the substance that would indefinitely prolong life—a liquid that was believed to be allied with the philosopher’s stone. Chinese Taoists not only sought the “pill of immortality” but developed techniques (meditation, breathing exercises, diet) that were thought to confer immortality by internal alchemy.
In pharmacy, an elixir is usually defined as a sweetened hydroalcoholic solution containing flavouring materials and usually medicinal substances.
