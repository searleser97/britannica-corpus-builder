Moses ben Jacob Cordovero,  (born 1522—died  1570, Safed, Palestine [now Ẕefat, Israel]), Galilean rabbi who organized and codified the Zoharistic Kabbala. He was the teacher of another leading Kabbalist, Isaac Luria.
Little is known of Cordovero’s origin and early life. He was a disciple of Joseph Karo. His first major systematic work was Pardes rimonim, which he had completed by the age of 27. His second work of this type, Elimah rabati, was completed 10 years later. In these works and in his extensive commentary on the Sefer ha-zohar (the classic text of Jewish esoteric mysticism), Cordovero attempted to summarize and synthesize kabbalistic thought to that time and to put forth his own interpretive kabbalistic system.
