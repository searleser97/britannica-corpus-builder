Dharma-Thakur, also called Dharma-Ray,  folk deity of eastern India whose origins are obscure.
Dharma-Thakur is worshipped as the “high god” of a large number of villages of the Rahr Plains, a region that comprises the greater part of modern West Bengal state. Dharma-Thakur has no prescribed form; he is worshipped in the form of stones, as a wooden votive slab, or through a pair of wooden sandals. Among other attributes he is a fertility god and a healer of disease. Worship of Dharma-Thakur is correlated with sun worship, and Dharma-Thakur’s annual worship, known as Dharma-puja, has been described as a kind of sympathetic magic to make the monsoon rains begin to fall. Among the neighbouring tribal peoples there are a number of practices and deities that share some of the characteristics of Dharma-Thakur. The majesty and exploits of Dharma-Thakur are presented in a class of works in Bengali literature known as Dharma-mangal.
