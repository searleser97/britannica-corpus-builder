Nowruz, also spelled Nōrūz, Nō Rūz, or Nō-Rūz,  festival celebrating the new year on the Persian calendar, usually beginning on March 21 on the Gregorian calendar. Though it is a largely secular celebration, it is often associated with and influenced by Zoroastrianism and Parsiism, in which Nowruz is a religious holiday. The festival is celebrated in many countries with significant Persian cultural influence, including Iran, Iraq, India, Afghanistan, and much of Central Asia.
Nowruz traditions vary widely, though some are relatively commonplace. Preparation for the new year includes arrangement of the haft-sīn—a spread of seven items representing renewal and springtime. Its centrepiece is the sabzeh, a sprouting plant, which symbolizes rebirth. Communal festivities include bonfires, feasts, and celebrations of culture such as musical performances, poetry readings, and traditional sports.
Among the Parsis, the Nōrūz (“New Day”) is a celebration that warrants the performance of five prescribed liturgies: the Āfringān, prayers of love or praise; the Bāj, prayers honouring yazatas (“ones worthy of worship”) or fravashis (“preexistent souls”); the Yasna, a rite that includes the offering and ritual drinking of the sacred liquor haoma; the Fravartigan, or Farokhshi, prayers commemorating the dead; and the Satum, prayers recited at funeral feasts. Throughout the day, Parsis greet one another with the rite of hamāzor, in which one’s right hand is passed between the palms of another. Words of greeting and good wishes are then exchanged.
