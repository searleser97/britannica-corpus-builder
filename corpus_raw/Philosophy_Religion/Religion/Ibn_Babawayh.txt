Ibn Bābawayh, also spelled Ibn Babūyā, in full Abū Jaʿfar Muḥammad ibn Abū al-Ḥasan ʿAlī ibn Ḥusayn ibn Mūsā al-Qummī,  also called aṣ-Ṣadūq,  (born c. 923, Khorāsān province, Iran—died 991, Rayy), Islamic theologian, author of one of the “Four Books” that are the basic authorities for the doctrine of Twelver (Ithnā ʿAshāri) Shīʿah.
Little is known about Ibn Bābawayh’s life. According to legend he was born as the result of special prayers to the mahdī (the expected one). In 966 he left Khorāsān for Baghdad, possibly attracted by the Shīʿī inclination of the Būyid dynasty that ruled there. Within a short time he was recognized as the spokesman and leading intellectual figure of Twelver Shīʿah.
More than 200 separate works have been attributed to Ibn Bābawayh, although only a few are now extant. His Risālat al-iʿtiqādāt (Shīʿite Creed, 1942) is important for the study of the doctrinal development of Shīʿah. His works are still widely used wherever Twelver Shīʿī are found.
