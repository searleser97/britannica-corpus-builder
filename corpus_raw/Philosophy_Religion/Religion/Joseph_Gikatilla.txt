Joseph Gikatilla,  (born 1248, Medinaceli, Castile, Spain—died c. 1305, Peñafiel), major Spanish Kabbalist whose writings influenced those of Moses de León, presumed author of the Zohar (“Book of Splendour”), an important work of Jewish mysticism. Gikatilla’s early studies of philosophy and the Talmud (the rabbinical compendium of law, lore, and commentary) continued to influence him after he turned to mysticism, as indicated by his attempts to reconcile philosophy with the Kabbala, the compilation of Jewish mystical writings.
While still a young man, Gikatilla became a pupil of Abraham Abulafia, a profound student of the Kabbala. Under his influence, the 26-year-old Gikatilla wrote his seminal Ginnat eʾgoz (“Nut Orchard”), taking his title from the Song of Solomon 6:11. In Gikatilla’s lexicon, the nut is an emblem of mysticism itself, while Ginnat employs the initial letters of three different names for methods of esoteric exegesis. Gikatilla’s book greatly influenced his contemporary and probable friend, Moses de León. Gikatilla was, in turn, influenced by the Zohar, as evidenced by his next major work, Shaʿareʾora (“Gates of Light”), an account of Kabbalist symbolism.
