Avinu Malkenu,   (Hebrew: “Our Father, Our King”), the opening words of each verse of a Jewish litany of supplication that is recited in synagogues with special devotion during the Ten Days of Penitence (except on the sabbath), which mark the beginning of the new religious year. Reform Jews recite the prayer only on Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur, the first and last day of the 10-day observance.
The great rabbi Akiba (c. ad 40–135) is said to have composed the basic verses on a Jewish fast day to relieve a disastrous drought. The prayer is, thus, also part of the liturgy on Jewish fast days (except on the ninth day of Av). Praying as a unit, the congregation acknowledges God as “Our Father, Our King,” begs forgiveness for sins committed, and beseeches God to grant certain blessings.
