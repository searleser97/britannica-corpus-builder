Nicetas of Remesiana,  (flourished 5th century), bishop, theologian, and composer of liturgical verse, whose missionary activity and writings effected the Christianization of,  and cultivated a Latin culture among, the barbarians in the lower Danube valley.
After becoming bishop of Remesiana (later the Serbian village of Bela Palanka, near the town of Niš) circa 366, Nicetas twice visited Paulinus, who was bishop of Nola, in Campania (near Naples), a fellow missionary, the foremost Latin literary figure of his age, and the primary source for knowledge of Nicetas’s life and pastoral activity. Scholarship, having laboriously reconstructed substantial portions of Nicetas’s theological tracts, has furnished sufficient evidence to identify his principal doctrinal work, the Competentibus ad baptismum instructionis libelli sex (“Six Books of Instructions for Baptismal Candidates”). The lengthy excerpts from this catechetical series, particularly “On the Meaning of Faith,” “On the Power of the Holy Spirit,” and the “Commentary on the Apostolic-Nicene Creed,” indicate that Nicetas stressed the orthodox position in Trinitarian doctrine consonant with the leading 4th-century theologian Cyril of Jerusalem. Accordingly, Nicetas opposed any attribution of a created nature either to the Son, contrary to the Arians, or to the Holy Spirit, as against the Macedonians. Moreover, these documents contain, apparently for the first time in early Christian literature, the term “communion of saints,” in reference to the belief in a mystical bond uniting both the living and the dead in a confirmed hope and love. This expression henceforth played a central role in formulations of the Christian creed.
Other patristic writers, including the 5th-century church historian Gennadius of Marseilles, credit Nicetas with promoting Latin sacred music for use during the eucharistic worship with its vigil from Saturday evening to Sunday morning. He wrote a rationale for such practice and reputedly composed a number of liturgical hymns, among which some scholars since the 20th century have identified the major Latin Christian acclamation chant of thanksgiving, the “Te Deum laudamus” (Latin: “God, We Praise You”).
