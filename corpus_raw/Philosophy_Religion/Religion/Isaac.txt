Isaac,  in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) book of Genesis, the second of the patriarchs of Israel, the only son of Abraham and Sarah, and the father of Esau and Jacob. Although Sarah was past the age of childbearing, God promised Abraham and Sarah that they would have a son, and Isaac was born. Later, to test Abraham’s obedience, God commanded Abraham to sacrifice the boy. Abraham made all the preparations for the ritual sacrifice, but God spared Isaac at the last moment.
In both the Old and the New Testament, God is called the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, because with them God’s relationship of promise and purpose was fixed for all those who descended from them. The story of Abraham’s acquiescence to God’s command to sacrifice Isaac was used in the early Christian church as an example of faith (Hebrews 11:17) and of obedience (James 2:21). In later Jewish tradition the sacrifice of Isaac was cited in appeals for the mercy of God.
