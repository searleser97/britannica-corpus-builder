Charles Cutler Torrey,  (born Dec. 20, 1863, East Hardwick, Vt., U.S.—died  Nov. 12, 1956, Chicago), U.S. Semitic scholar who held independent and stimulating views on certain biblical problems.
Torrey studied at Bowdoin (Maine) College and Andover (Mass.) Theological Seminary and in Europe. He taught Semitic languages at Andover (1892–1900) and Yale (1900–32), and was founder and first director (1900–01) of the American School of Archaeology (later renamed the American School of Oriental Research) at Jerusalem.
Torrey’s Islāmic studies are represented by The Mohammedan Conquest of Egypt and North Africa (1901), based on the Arabic work of Ibn ʿAbd al-Hakam, of which he subsequently published an edition (1922), and by The Jewish Foundation of Islam (1933). He offered a fresh critical appraisal and rearrangement of the books of Ezra and Nehemiah in The Composition and Historical Value of Ezra-Nehemiah (1896), which was followed up by his Ezra Studies (1910) and by The Chronicler’s History of Israel (1954). In The Second Isaiah: A New Interpretation (1928), he argued that Isa. 34–35 and 40–66 should be dated c. 400 bc. His Pseudo-Ezekiel and the Original Prophecy (1930) presents his theory that the canonical book of Ezekiel is a revision of a 3rd-century pseudepigraphon. In The Translations Made from the Original Aramaic Gospels (1912), The Four Gospels: A New Translation (1933), and Our Translated Gospels (1936), Torrey held that the four Gospels were Greek translations from Aramaic originals. The posthumous Apocalypse of John (1958) argues that Revelation was a translation of an Aramaic original written in ad 68.
