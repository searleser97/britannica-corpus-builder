Saint Walburga, also called Waldburg, Walpurgis, Vaubourg, or Gauburge,  (born c. 710, probably in the kingdom of Wessex, England—died February 25, 779, Heidenheim, Alemannia [now in Germany]; feast day February 25), abbess and missionary who, with her brothers Willibald of Eichstätt and Winebald of Heidenheim, was important in St. Boniface’s organization of the Frankish church.
Walburga was a Benedictine at the monastery of Wimborne, Dorsetshire, when Winebald summoned her to rule the nuns at his double monastery of monks and nuns at Heidenheim, the only one of this type in 8th-century Germany. On his death in 761 she ruled the whole monastery.
Buried at Heidenheim, her body was later moved and interred in the Church of the Holy Cross at Eichstätt. Soon after her death, memory of her seems to have become confused with that of Waldborg, a pre-Christian fertility goddess. On Walpurgis Night—the eve of May 1, the day on which her relics were taken to Eichstätt—witches are believed to rendezvous in the Harz mountains.
