Laurentius, English Lawrence,  (flourished  6th century, Italy), antipope in 498 and from 501 to about 505/507, whose disputed papal election gave his name to the Laurentian schism, a split in the Roman Catholic Church.
Late in the 5th century, the Roman church’s relations with the Eastern church in Constantinople became badly strained. Pope Anastasius II attempted conciliation, which alarmed some of the Roman clergy, and factions arose. Upon Anastasius’ death (Nov. 19, 498), two parties confronted each other—one led by Laurentius, an archpriest who favoured Anastasius’ policy, and the other under the Sardinian deacon St. Symmachus. Three days later a minority of clergy elected Laurentius pope, while a majority chose Symmachus. The Ostrogothic king Theodoric the Great, then master of Italy, was considered to be impartial, and thus both parties appealed to him to decide the legal claimant. Theodoric finally favoured Symmachus, based on the majority vote.
Laurentius submitted to the decision and was then appointed bishop of Nocera in Campania. After his partisans continued in active opposition, however, Theodoric summoned Symmachus to Ravenna. When the pope fled, Theodoric convoked a Roman synod (501) to judge Symmachus, whose party was mauled en route to the synod by the Laurentians. The synod’s final decrees dissatisfied Theodoric, and he allowed Laurentius to return to Rome, where he was proclaimed pope by the Laurentians. A period of civil chaos and factional wars ensued. In 505(?) the Alexandrian deacon Dioscorus induced Theodoric to declare Symmachus the legal pontiff. Laurentius was forced out of Rome and retired under the protection of the patrician Festus. Only an ineffectual remnant of his party continued in schism.
