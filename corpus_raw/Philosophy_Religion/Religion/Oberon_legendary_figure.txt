Oberon, French Alberon, German Alberich,  king of the elves, or of the “faerie,” in the French medieval poem Huon de Bordeaux. In this poem Oberon is a dwarf-king, living in the woodland, who by magic powers helps the hero to accomplish a seemingly impossible task. In the legendary history of the Merovingian dynasty Oberon is a magician, the brother of Merowech (Mérovée). In the medieval German epic the Nibelungenlied he is the dwarf who guards the underground treasure of the Nibelungen and is overcome by Siegfried and forced to yield the “cloak of darkness” (the Tarn-kappe). In another Middle High German epic, entitled Ortnit, Alberich appears as the king of the dwarfs and the titular hero’s father.
Huon de Bordeaux, through the prose translation of John Bouchier (Lord Berners), furnished the name Oberon and the fairy element for Shakespeare’s Midsummer Night’s Dream (first performed 1595–96), Ben Jonson’s court masque Oberon, the Faery Prince (1611), and Christoph Martin Wieland’s verse romance Oberon (1780). The character is treated again in Carl Maria von Weber’s opera Oberon (1826). In the musical dramas of Richard Wagner, Alberich is the Nibelung who steals the magic gold from the Rhine maidens; he is a darker character than his predecessors.
