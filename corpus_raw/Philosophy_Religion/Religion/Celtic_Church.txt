Celtic Church,  the early Christian church in the British Isles, founded probably in the 3rd century. Highly ascetic in character, it contributed to the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons in the 7th century, but its organization and customs—for instances concerning the calculation of the date of Easter—soon gave way to that of Rome. It survived in Wales until the 11th century and in Scotland and Ireland until the 12th.
