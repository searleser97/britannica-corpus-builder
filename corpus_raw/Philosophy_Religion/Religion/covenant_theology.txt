Covenant theology, also called federal theology,  type of Reformed (Calvinist) theology emphasizing the notion of a covenant, or alliance, instituted by God, which humans are obligated to keep. This concept was developed in the latter part of the 16th century into the notions of the two covenants: the biblical covenant of works (or of nature) made by God with Adam and the covenant of grace made between God and human through the grace of Christ. In Reformed theology, Christ was viewed as the second Adam.
English Puritans of the 17th century incorporated the concept of the two covenants (law and grace) into what has been called a natural and a supernatural covenant. In the development of this theological movement, the 16th–17th-century English Puritan theologian William Ames’s book Medulla Theologiae (Marrow of Sacred Divinity) influenced Reformed theology for nearly a century. Even more influential was Johannes Cocceius (1603–69), whose 1648 work Summa doctrinae de foedere et testamento Deo (“The Summa on the Doctrine Concerning the Covenant and Testament of God”) is based on the notion that the relation between God and humans, both before and after the Fall, was a covenant. The covenantal concept spread among Reformed groups in England, Germany, Scotland, the Netherlands, and the New England colonies, where it was especially influential.
