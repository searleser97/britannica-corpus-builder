Kaddish, also spelled Qaddish,  in Judaism, a doxology (hymn of praise to God) that is usually recited in Aramaic at the end of principal sections of all synagogue services. The nucleus of the prayer is the phrase “Glorified and sanctified be God’s great name throughout the world which He has created according to His will. May He establish His kingdom in your lifetime and during your days.” The congregation responds: “May His great name be blessed forever to all eternity.” The prayer’s main idea goes back to ancient times and is reflected in the Lord’s Prayer of Christians.
Originally the Kaddish was recited in the rabbinical academies at the conclusion of public study or after the sermon of the preacher. In time it became a regular feature of the synagogue service. The prayer expresses, in addition to the praise of God, the plea for the speedy realization of the messianic age; and, because the resurrection of the dead is associated with the coming of the Messiah, the Kaddish eventually became the prayer of mourners. It is recited by the mourners for a period of 11 months and one day after the death of a parent or close relative. There are longer and shorter forms of the Kaddish.
