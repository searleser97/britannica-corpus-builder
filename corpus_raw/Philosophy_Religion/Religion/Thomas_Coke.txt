Thomas Coke,  (born Sept. 9, 1747, Brecon, Brecknockshire, Wales—died  May 3, 1814, at sea en route from Liverpool to Ceylon), English clergyman, first bishop of the Methodist Church, founder of its missions, and friend of Methodism’s founder, John Wesley, who called Coke his “right hand.”
Coke was ordained an Anglican priest in 1772 and served as curate at South Petherton, Somerset, from 1772 to 1776. After meeting Wesley, however, he was dismissed from his curacy for conducting the open-air and cottage services Wesley recommended.
In 1777 Coke formally joined the Methodists. He became the first president of the Irish Conference of Methodists in 1782 and two years later was named by Wesley as superintendent of the new missions to North America.
In 1787, during one of Coke’s nine visits to America, he was designated “bishop” despite Wesley’s protest. As president of the English conference in 1797 and 1805, he sought to introduce the title among English Methodists. Rebuffed, he asked the prime minister, Lord Liverpool, to make him a bishop of the Anglican church in India. This request denied, Coke raised funds for his own Methodist mission and was en route to India when he died. A prolific writer, he was author of Commentary on the Old and New Testaments, 5 vol. (1801–03); A History of the West Indies (1808–11); several volumes of sermons; and a Life of John Wesley (with Henry Moore; 1792). Coke ardently opposed slavery.
