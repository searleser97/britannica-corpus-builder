Hindu calendar,  dating system used in India from about 1000 bce and still used to establish dates of the Hindu religious year. It is based on a year of 12 lunar months; i.e., 12 full cycles of phases of the Moon. The discrepancy between the lunar year of about 354 days and the solar year of about 365 days is partially resolved by intercalation of an extra month every 30 months.
