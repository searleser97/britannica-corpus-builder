James Nayler, Nayler also spelled Naylor,  (born 1618, Ardsley, Yorkshire, England—died October 1660, London), one of the most prominent early English Quakers.
Nayler served in the Parliamentary army (1642–51) in the English Civil Wars and was for two years quartermaster under the general John Lambert. During this period he began preaching as an Independent until in 1651, after a meeting with George Fox, the founder of the Society of Friends, at Wakefield, he became a Quaker. For three years he worked closely with Fox and underwent a 20-week imprisonment for blasphemy in 1653. In 1655 he went to London and achieved a prominent position among Quakers there but came under the unfortunate influence of certain overenthusiastic Quaker women who persuaded him that he was a reincarnation of Christ. In October 1656 Nayler and his entourage entered Bristol in procession imitating Christ’s entry to Jerusalem. For this he was arrested, tried before Parliament, and sentenced to severe punishment and imprisonment. In 1658 he acknowledged his error in a letter to Parliament and was released in 1659. He was reconciled with Fox in 1660 and preached again in London until his death.
