Henri II de Savoie, duc de Nemours,  (born 1625—died January 14, 1659, Paris, France), younger brother of Charles-Amédée de Savoie, whom he succeeded as duke in 1652.
Henri had been trained for the church and was named archbishop of Reims in 1651. He was relieved of his vows in order to succeed his childless brother and eventually, on May 22, 1657, married Marie d’Orléans, daughter of Henri II, duc de Longueville. Gentle but sickly, afflicted with epilepsy, he died childless, the last of his house.
