St. Swithin, Swithin also spelled Swithun,  (born c. 800—died July 2, 862, Winchester, Hampshire, England; feast day July 15), celebrated Anglo-Saxon saint, bishop of Winchester, and royal counselor whose name is still associated with an old  meteorological superstition. He served as counselor to Kings Egbert and Aethelwulf of the West Saxons. On or about October 30, 852, he was consecrated bishop of Winchester. Nothing else is reliably known of his life.
There is a superstition that rain on St. Swithin’s feast day means rain for 40 days. The first evidence for the weather prophecy seems to be a 13th- or 14th-century entry in a manuscript at Emmanuel College, Cambridge. His feast day is the day his relics were transferred in 971 from the churchyard to Winchester Cathedral, after reports of miracles, by Bishop Aethelwold.
After 971, Swithin’s cult spread widely, and his name displaced those of Saints Peter and Paul in the dedication of the cathedral. His feast is observed in the Anglican calendar.
