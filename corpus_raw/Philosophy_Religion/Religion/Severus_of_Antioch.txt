Severus of Antioch,  (born c. 465, Sozopolis, Pisidia, Asia Minor [near modern Konya, Turkey]—died 538, Xois, Egypt), Greek Christian monk-theologian, patriarch of Antioch, and miaphysite leader  during the reigns of the Byzantine emperors Anastasius I (491–518) and Justinian I (527–565). His later ecclesiastical condemnation and exile hastened the sect’s eventual decline, particularly in Syria and Egypt.
Severus studied theology in Alexandria and lived as a monk in Palestine before being ordained a priest.  He was a leading proponent of miaphysitism, a Christological perspective that viewed Jesus Christ’s human and divine natures as being united through the Incarnation in a single nature. Proponents of miaphysitism rejected the position that had been accepted at the Council of Chalcedon in 451, which held that Christ’s two natures were distinct. In the council’s wake, many miaphysites were dismissed or even condemned as advocates of monophysitism—the perspective that Christ’s divine nature had subsumed his inconsequential human nature—a charge that they strenuously denied.
Severus went to Constantinople in 509 to answer to heresy charges. While at Constantinople, Severus became a confidant of the Byzantine emperor Anastasius, who nominated him to be patriarch of Antioch in 512. With Severus’s accession to this post, the miaphysites came into full control of Antioch. But with the succession of the emperor Justin I (518–527), who enforced a uniform Chalcedonian Christian orthodoxy throughout the empire, Severus was forced to flee to Egypt, where he took refuge with Timothy IV, the miaphysite patriarch of Alexandria. Severus emerged as the leader of the miaphysite Coptic churches in Egypt and Syria. At the beginning of Justinian I’s reign, Severus regained his patriarchal office, but in 535 he again had to flee to Egypt, where he went into final retirement.
