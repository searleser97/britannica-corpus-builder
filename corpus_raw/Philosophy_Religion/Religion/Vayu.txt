Vayu,  ancient Iranian wind-god, likely related to the Hindu god Vāyu; he was also connected with battle as an avatar of the war-god Vrthraghna. Also connected with fate, he was believed to have a beneficient and a baleful aspect. As part of an ancient pantheon Vayu appears to have been eclipsed following Zoroaster’s reforms but re-emerged in the later Avesta (see Zoroastrianism and Parsiism).
