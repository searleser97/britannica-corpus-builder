Michael, Hebrew Mikhaʾel, Arabic Mīkāl or Mīkhāʾīl, also called St. Michael the Archangel,  in the Bible and in the Qurʾān (as Mīkāl), one of the archangels. He is repeatedly depicted as the “great captain,” the leader of the heavenly hosts, and the warrior helping the children of Israel. Early in the history of the Christian church he came to be regarded as the helper of the church’s armies against the heathen and against the attacks of the Devil. He holds the secret of the mighty “word” by the utterance of which God created heaven and earth and was “the angel who spoke [to Moses] at Mount Sinai” (Acts 7:38). The numerous representations of Michael in art reflect his character as a warrior: he is shown with a sword, in combat with or triumph over a dragon, from the story in the Book of Revelation (Apocalypse).
The feast of St. Michael, which originated in Phrygia, is kept on September 29 in the West, where it is also known as Michaelmas. Most Eastern Orthodox churches commemorate St. Michael and the other angels on November 8, and the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church honours him on the 12th of each month. In the Roman Catholic Church the feast of the Appearing (or Apparition) of St. Michael the Archangel is kept on May 8. According to legend, this appearance took place on Mount Gargano, in Apulia, about 492, and the mountain became an important medieval pilgrimage site. A formal prayer to St. Michael originated with Pope Leo XIII in 1886.
