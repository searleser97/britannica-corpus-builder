Pāramitā,   in Mahāyāna (“Greater Vehicle”) Buddhism, any of the perfections, or transcendental virtues, practiced by bodhisattvas (“Buddhas-to-be”) in advanced stages of their path toward enlightenment. The six virtues are generosity (dāna-pāramitā); morality (śīla-pāramitā); perseverance (kṣānti-pāramitā); vigour (vīrya-pāramitā); meditation, or concentration (dhyāna-pāramitā); and wisdom (prajñā-pāramitā). Some lists expand the virtues to 10 by adding skill in the means of helping others (upāya [kauśalya]-pāramitās), profound resolution to produce enlightenment (praṇidhāna-pāramitā), perfection of the 10 powers (bala-pāramitā), and practice of transcendent knowledge (jñāna-pāramitā).
