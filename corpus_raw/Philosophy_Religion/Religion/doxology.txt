Doxology,   an expression of praise to God. In Christian worship there are three common doxologies:
1. The greater doxology, or Gloria in Excelsis, is the Gloria of the Roman Catholic and Anglican masses, and in its hundreds of musical settings it is usually sung in Latin. It is used in the Roman Catholic liturgy in a contemporary translation and is used liturgically, often in older translations, in many Anglican, Lutheran, and other Protestant worship services. The Latin text, from the Roman Missal, follows:
The modern Roman Catholic English version reads as follows:
2. The lesser doxology, or Gloria Patri, is used in most Christian traditions at the close of the psalmody:

Most Protestant churches use this form, often in conjunction with the presentation of tithes and offerings.
