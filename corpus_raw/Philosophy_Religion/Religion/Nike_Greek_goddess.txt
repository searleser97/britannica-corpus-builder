Nike,  in ancient Greek religion, the goddess of victory, daughter of the giant Pallas and of the infernal River Styx. Nike probably did not originally have a separate cult at Athens.
As an attribute of both Athena, the goddess of wisdom, and the chief god, Zeus, Nike was represented in art as a small figure carried in the hand by those divinities. Athena Nike was always wingless. Nike alone was winged. She sometimes appears carrying a palm branch, wreath, or Hermesâ€™ staff as the messenger of victory. Nike is also portrayed erecting a trophy or, frequently, hovering with outspread wings over the victor in a competition, for her functions referred to success not only in war but in all undertakings. Indeed, Nike gradually came to be recognized as a sort of mediator of success between gods and men.
At Rome, where Nike was called Victoria, she was worshipped from the earliest times. She came to be regarded as the protecting goddess of the Senate, and her statue in the Curia Julia (originally set up by Augustus in memory of the Battle of Actium) was the cause of the final combat between Christianity and paganism toward the end of the 4th century.
Among artistic representations of Nike are the sculpture by Paeonius (c. 420 bce) and the Winged Victory of Samothrace. The latter, discovered on Samothrace in 1863 and now in the Louvre Museum, Paris, was probably erected by Rhodians about 190 bce to commemorate a sea battle. Excavations have shown that the sculpture was placed alighting on a flagship, which was set in the ground in such a way that it appeared to float.
