Hito-no-michi,   (Japanese: “Way of Man”), Japanese religious sect founded by Miki Tokuharu (1871–1938); it was revived in a modified form after World War II as PL Kyōdan (q.v.; from the English words “perfect liberty” and a Japanese term for “church”). Hito-no-michi was a development of an earlier religious movement, Tokumitsu-kyō, named after its founder, Kanada Tokumitsu (1863–1919), who taught that the sufferings of his followers could be transferred to him by divine mediation and that he would vicariously endure their troubles. Hito-no-michi was compelled by the government to affiliate itself with one of the Sect Shintō denominations, Fusō-kyō; but its unorthodox teachings and growing strength (in 1934 it claimed a membership of 600,000) aroused the disfavour of the government. In 1937 the sect was ordered disbanded, and Miki Tokuharu and his son Miki Tokuchika were jailed. Tokuchika was released from prison in 1945 and shortly afterward established PL Kyōdan.
