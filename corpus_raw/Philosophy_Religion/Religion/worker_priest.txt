Worker-priest,   in the Roman Catholic church, member of a movement, especially in France and Belgium after World War II, seeking to reach the working classes, who had become largely alienated from the church. The worker-priests set aside their clerical garb and left their clerical dwellings to take jobs in factories and on construction sites, sharing the living conditions and social and economic problems of their coworkers. The movement was given support by Cardinal Emmanuel Suhard of Paris. Their experiences impelled some of the worker-priests to become politically active, joining their fellow workers in various demonstrations regarding such matters as housing, antiracism, and peace. The movement was ordered discontinued in 1954 by Pius XII and again in 1959 by John XXIII. In 1965 Paul VI approved it in modified form.
