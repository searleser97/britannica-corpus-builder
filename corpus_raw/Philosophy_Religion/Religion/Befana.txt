Befana,  in Italian tradition, the old woman who fills childrenâ€™s stockings with gifts on Epiphany (Twelfth Night). Too busy to accompany the Three Wise Men on their journey to adore the infant Jesus, she said she would see them on their return. According to legend, they returned by another way, and she was doomed to look for them forever.
