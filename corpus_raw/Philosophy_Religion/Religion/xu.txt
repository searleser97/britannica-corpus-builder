Xu, Wade-Giles romanization hsu (Chinese: “emptiness,” or “purity”),  in Chinese Daoism, a state of equilibrium through which one becomes receptive to and attuned with the transforming experience of which one is a part. It is characterized by an unself-conscious sense of continuity with one’s immediate context. This transforming experience is called dao.
Contemplative Daoists attain xu by stilling those thought processes and emotions that would mediate and thus distort the flow of experience, which the Daoists call “the transformation of things” (wuhua). Historically, many schools of Daoism have made use of breath-control techniques in order to quiet the mind; the more elaborate systems of breath control, requiring years of practice, were condemned by some Daoists as excessive contrivances that ironically have the opposite effect.
