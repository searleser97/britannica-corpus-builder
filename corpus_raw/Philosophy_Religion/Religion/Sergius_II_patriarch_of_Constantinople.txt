Sergius II,  (died July 1019), patriarch of Constantinople (1001–19) who claimed the title of “ecumenical patriarch” against the objections of the papacy. He also supported for a time the continuing schismatical movement begun in 867 in the Byzantine church by the patriarch Photius (c. 820–895), occasioned by a speculative theological controversy concerning the doctrine of the divine Trinity.
Abbot of a monastery in Constantinople, Sergius II was elected patriarch about July 1001. A story that Pope Sergius IV (1009–12) sent Sergius II the Synodicon, a letter insisting on the Latin Trinitarian teaching that the Holy Spirit relates to both Father and Son (Filioque), thus initiating the Eastern schism when Patriarch Sergius reacted by erasing the pope’s name from the Byzantine prayer intercessions, is the invention of 12th-century controversialists. Patriarch Sergius’ support of the Photian schism was temporary, for political reasons, and it is not certain that he ever excommunicated Sergius IV for not acknowledging the Greek Orthodox doctrine that the Spirit relates only to the Father.
Sergius II resisted a movement for the veneration of the 10th-century mystical theologian Simeon the Studite and supported the Byzantine landowners against the attempt of the emperor Basil II (976–1025) to make them answerable for unpaid taxes due from the peasantry.
