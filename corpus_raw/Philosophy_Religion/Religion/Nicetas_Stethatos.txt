Nicetas Stethatos,  (born c. 1000—died c. 1090), Byzantine mystic, theologian, and outspoken polemist in the 11th-century Greek Orthodox–Latin church controversy concluding in the definitive schism of 1054.
A monk of the Stoudion monastery in Constantinople (now Istanbul), Nicetas allied himself c. 1020 with his spiritual tutor, Symeon the New Theologian, whose biographer and apologist he became when Symeon was attacked for his system of contemplative prayer. In his biography of Symeon, Nicetas incorporated his own views on the inner experience of beatifying illumination. He also wrote a treatise and several commentaries on ascetical practices.
In the 11th-century conflict between the Greek and Latin churches, Nicetas served as theologian-polemist to Constantinople’s patriarch Michael Cerularius, who, during 1053–54, disputed sharply with the papal legate Cardinal Humbert of Silva Candida. Nicetas criticized Western doctrine on the manner of relating the Holy Spirit to the divinity, on the claims of papal supremacy, on mandatory clerical celibacy, and on the use of unleavened bread in Roman eucharistic worship.
