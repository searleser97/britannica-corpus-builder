Parish,   in some Christian church polities, a geographic unit served by a pastor or priest. It is a subdivision of a diocese.
In the New Testament, the Greek word paroikia means sojourning, or temporary, residence. In the very early church, the parish was the entire body of Christians in a city under the bishop, who stood in the same relationship to the Christians of the entire city as does the parish priest to the parish in modern times. In the 4th century, when Christianity in western Europe spread to the countryside, Christians in an important village were organized into a unit with their own priest under the jurisdiction of the bishop of the nearest city. The unit was called a parish.
In Anglo-Saxon England the first parish churches were founded in important administrative centres. They were called minsters, and subsequently old minsters, to distinguish them from the later village churches. When the Church of England became independent of Rome during the 16th century, it retained the parish as the basic unit of the church.
The parish system in Europe was essentially created between the 8th and 12th centuries. The Council of Trent (1545â€“63) reorganized and reformed the parish system of the Roman Catholic church to make it more responsive to the needs of the people.
In civil government the parish is the lowest unit of government in England. In the United States, Louisiana is divided into parishes, the equivalent of counties in other states.
