Istiṣlāḥ, (Arabic: “to deem proper”)  in Islamic law, consideration of benefit, a norm employed by Muslim jurists to solve perplexing problems that find no clear answer in sacred religious texts. In such a situation, the judge reaches a decision by determining first what is materially most beneficial to the community as a whole, then what benefits the local community, and finally what benefits the individual. Almost all Muslim schools of theology acknowledge the usefulness and legitimacy of istiṣlāḥ, for they accept the premise that whatever is materially beneficial for humanity in general is almost certainly beneficial to individuals. Istiṣlāḥ may not be used when the material advantage to an individual or community directly conflicts with explicit teachings of Islam.
