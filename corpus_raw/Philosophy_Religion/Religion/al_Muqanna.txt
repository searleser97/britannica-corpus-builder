Al-Muqannaʿ, (Arabic: “The Veiled One”) byname of Hāshim ibn Ḥākim,  (died 783), religious leader, originally a fuller (cloth processor) from Merv, in Khorāsān, who led a revolt in that province against the ʿAbbāsid caliph al-Mahdī. Preaching a doctrine combining elements of Islam and Zoroastrianism, al-Muqannaʿ carried on warfare for about three years in the field and for two years longer in his fortress of Sanām before he was eventually defeated and committed suicide. He was the hero of the narrative poem Lalla Rookh (1817) by Thomas Moore.
