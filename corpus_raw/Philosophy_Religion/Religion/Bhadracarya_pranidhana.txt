Bhadracaryā-praṇidhāna, (Sanskrit: “Vows of Good Conduct”, ) also called Samantabhadra-caryā-praṇidhāna,  (“Practical Vows of Samantabhadra”), a Mahāyāna (“Greater Vehicle”) Buddhist text that has also made an important contribution to the Tantric Buddhism of Tibet. Closely related to the Avataṃsaka-sūtra (“Discourse on the Adornments of the Buddha”) and sometimes considered its final section, the Bhadracaryā-praṇidhāna presents a universe of totally interdependent phenomena manifesting the Buddha. But its main emphasis is on entering into the full realization of such a universe—or into the Pure Land of Amitābha—through actions conforming to the 10 great vows of the bodhisattva (buddha to be) Samantabhadra.
These 10 vows, understood as the essence of the vows and deeds of all past and future buddhas, came to be used as daily lessons in Chinese monasteries. In Tibet they were incorporated as utterances in a number of rites, thus influencing the development of Tantric ritualism.
Briefly summarized, the vows include: inexhaustible service to all buddhas; the learning and obedience of all teachings of all buddhas; the plaint for all buddhas to descend into the world; the teaching of the dharmas (universal truths) and the paramitas (transcendental virtues) to all beings; the embracing of all universes; the bringing together of all Buddha’s lands; the achievement of Buddha’s wisdom and powers to help all beings; the unity of all bodhisattvas; and the accommodation of all sentient beings through the teaching of wisdom and Nirvāṇa.
