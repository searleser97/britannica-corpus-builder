Ghaybah,   (Arabic: “absence,” or “concealment”), Islāmic doctrine, especially among such Shīʿite sects as the Ithnā ʿAsharīyah, or “Twelvers.” The term refers to the disappearance from view of the 12th and last imam (leader), Muḥammad al-Mahdī al-Ḥujjah, in 878.
Ghaybah is applied loosely to anyone whom God has withdrawn from the world and kept invisible to the eyes of ordinary men. The life of such a blessed person is thought to be miraculously prolonged by God through many generations and even centuries. The Shīʿites maintained that their imams, even though invisible, still live and return to human society from time to time to maintain order and to guide their followers along the right path. The ghaybah of the mahdi (“divinely guided one”) will end, according to the Shīʿites, when the mahdi finally appears in the last days of the world.
The Ṣūfīs (Muslim mystics), unlike the Shīʿites, understood ghaybah to mean the absence in the heart of all thoughts except those of God. It is the fanāʾ (“passing away”) of the carnal self. For Ṣūfīs, ghaybah is not a goal in itself but rather a stage that leads naturally to ḥuḍūr (presence) in God.
