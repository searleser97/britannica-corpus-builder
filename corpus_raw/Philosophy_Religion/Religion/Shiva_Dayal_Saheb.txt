Shiva Dayal Saheb, also called Shivdayal, original name Tulsi Ram,  (born 1818, Agra, Agra province, India—died 1878, Agra), founder of the esoteric Hindu and Sikh sect Radha Soami Satsang.
He was born into a devout Vaishnava family and established himself as a banker in Agra. In 1861 he revealed himself as the sant satguru (true teacher of spirituality) and began instructing a group of followers. He wrote two books, one in prose and one in verse, both titled Sar Bacan (“Essential Utterances”). Shiva Dayal Saheb’s ashes are entombed in a sacred garden (Dayal Bagh) near Agra, which is still a principal headquarters of the sect.
