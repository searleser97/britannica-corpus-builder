Basmalah, also called tasmiyah,  in Islam, the prayer formula Bism Allāh al-Raḥmān al-Raḥīm (“In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate”). This invocation, which was first introduced by the Qurʾān, appears at the beginning of every Qurʾānic surah (chapter) except the ninth (which presents a unique textual problem) and is frequently recited by Muslims to elicit God’s blessings on their important actions. The basmalah also introduces all formal documents and transactions and must always preface actions that are legally required or recommended. An abbreviated version precedes certain daily rituals, such as meals. The basmalah is often inscribed on amulets, reflecting a Sufi tradition holding that the phrase was inscribed on Adam’s side, Gabriel’s wing, Azrael’s palm, Moses’ staff, Solomon’s seal, and Jesus Christ’s tongue.
