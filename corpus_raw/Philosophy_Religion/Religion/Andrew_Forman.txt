Andrew Forman,  (born c. 1465—died  March 11, 1521), Scottish prelate and diplomat during the reigns of James IV and James V.
He was educated at the University of St. Andrews. James IV employed him as his emissary to Rome and to England, where he took part in negotiating James’s marriage (1503) to Margaret Tudor. From 1511 he was engaged in furthering the King’s plan for a general peace in Europe and for a great crusade against the Turks. To this end he acted as mediator between Louis XII of France and Pope Julius II, who were at war in northern Italy. Despite his record of peacemaking, Forman was blamed, perhaps unjustly, for the breach between Scotland and England leading to the death of James IV at the Battle of Flodden (Sept. 9, 1513).
Forman’s career gave him opportunities of acquiring benefices in Scotland, England, and France, including the bishopric of Moray (1501) and the archbishopric of Bourges (1513), but he failed to achieve elevation to the cardinalate. In 1514 Pope Leo X nominated him to the archbishopric of St. Andrews and appointed him papal legate in Scotland, although rival claimants kept him out of his see until 1516. As archbishop he issued constitutions for the discipline of clergy and laity.
