Bohrā, also spelled Bohorā,  in general, any Shīʿī Ismaʿīlī Muslim of the Mustaʿlī sect, living in western India. The name is a corruption of a Gujarati word, vahaurau, meaning “to trade.” The Bohrās include, in addition to this Shīʿī majority, often of the merchant class, a Sunnī minority who are usually peasant farmers. The Mustaʿlī sect (see Ismāʿīlīte), which originated in Egypt and later moved its religious centre to Yemen, gained a foothold in India through missionaries of the 11th century. After 1539, by which time the Indian community had grown quite large, the seat of the sect was moved from Yemen to Sidhpur, India. A split resulted in 1588 in the Bohrā community between followers of Dāʾūd ibn Quṭb Shāh and Sulaymān, who both claimed leadership of the community. The followers of Dāʾūd and Sulaymān have since remained the two major groups within the Bohrās, with no significant dogmatic differences, the dāʿī, or leader, of the Dāʾūdīs residing in Bombay, the leader of the Sulaymānī in Yemen.
