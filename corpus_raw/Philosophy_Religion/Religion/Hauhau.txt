Hauhau,  any of the radical members of the Maori Pai Marire (Maori: “Good and Peaceful”) religion, founded in 1862 in Taranaki on North Island, New Zealand. The movement was founded by Te Ua Haumene, a Maori prophet who had been captured in his youth and converted to Christianity before his release. Like most other Maori, he was opposed to the sale of Maori land, and he joined the Maori King Movement. In 1862 he had a vision that revealed to him the evil of the pakeha (non-Maori, or European) culture.
Adapting Christian religious tenets to Maori beliefs, Te Ua held that the Maori were a lost tribe of Israel. Their immediate task was to save themselves from the Europeans colonizing New Zealand, to recover their ancestral lands, and to establish the principle of pai marire. Despite this ideal of goodness and peace, some of the movement’s believers turned to violent resistance. These men, calling on Te Hau, the spirit of God in the wind, shouted the words “Pai Marire, hau, hau!” in battle, believing that it would protect them from European bullets. This war cry is the origin of their popular name, Hauhau, and belief in its effectiveness accounted for their daring in battle. In 1864–65, as the Hauhau took to the battlefield, most other Maori forces were going down in defeat; immediate and large-scale European confiscation of Maori land, however, drove many Maori into the ranks of armed dissidents, and Hauhau remained a common label for all of the resisters, whether or not they were associated with Pai Marire. Fighting continued until 1872, by which time the Pai Marire itself had dwindled.
