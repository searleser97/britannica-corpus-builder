T.F. Middleton, in full Thomas Fanshaw Middleton,  (born January 28, 1769, Kedleston, Derbyshire, England—died July 8, 1822, Calcutta [now Kolkata], India), noted Anglican missionary who was the first bishop of Calcutta and founder of Bishop’s College there.
Middleton served various parishes in England from his ordination as a priest in 1792 to 1812, when he became archdeacon of Huntingdon. Widely recognized as a biblical scholar after publication of his study The Doctrine of the Greek Article Applied to the Criticism and Illustration of the New Testament (1808), Middleton was consecrated in 1814 as bishop of Calcutta. In that position he was responsible for overseeing Anglican missionary work in both Australia and all of India. Despite his strict Anglicanism, he readily licensed the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, a German Lutheran group, to perform missionary work in his see. In 1820 he established Bishop’s College at Calcutta to train missionaries and teachers for the growing Anglican church in India. Middleton’s Sermons were published posthumously in 1824.
