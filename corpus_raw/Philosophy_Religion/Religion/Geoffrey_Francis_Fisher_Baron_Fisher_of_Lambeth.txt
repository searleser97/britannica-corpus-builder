Geoffrey Francis Fisher, Baron Fisher of Lambeth,  (born May 5, 1887, Nuneaton, Warwickshire, Eng.—died Sept. 15, 1972, Sherborne, Dorset), 99th archbishop of Canterbury (1945–61).
The son, grandson, and great-grandson of Anglican rectors of Higham-on-the-Hill, Leicestershire, the young Fisher attended Exeter College, Oxford (1906–11), and the Wells Theological College, becoming a deacon in 1912 and a priest in 1913. He became headmaster at Repton School (1914–32), bishop of Chester (1932–39), and then bishop of London (1939–45) at the outset of World War II. The bombings, evacuations, and general disorganizations of parish life were severe challenges, and Fisher organized a multidenominational reconstruction committee and headed a war-damage committee. He also associated himself with the Sword of the Spirit movement, seeking cooperation between the Roman Catholic Church and other churches. His administrative and organizational skills led to his appointment as archbishop of Canterbury on Jan. 2, 1945.
Fisher conducted the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in Westminster Abbey in June 1953. Over the years he engaged himself in many political and social issues of his time and was especially associated with efforts to bring the Church of England and the so-called Free Churches into closer association. His visit to Pope John XXIII in December 1960 revolutionized the atmosphere of relations between the Church of England and Rome. He also traveled widely around the globe, to Africa, Asia, Australia and New Zealand, and North America. He resigned on Jan. 17, 1961, and was concurrently made a life peer as Baron Fisher of Lambeth.
