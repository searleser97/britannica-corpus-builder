Kanphata Yogi, also called Gorakhnathiand Nathapanthi,  member of an order of religious ascetics in India that venerates the Hindu deity Shiva. Kanphata Yogis are distinguished by the large earrings they wear in the hollows of their ears (kanphata, “ear split”). They are sometimes referred to as Tantric (esoteric) sannyasis (ascetics), because of their emphasis on the acquiring of supernatural powers in contrast to more-common practices of devotion (bhakti) and meditation. They are followers of Gorakhnath, who is said to have lived in the 12th century or even earlier. The ideology of the Kanphata Yogis incorporates elements of mysticism, magic, and alchemy absorbed from both Shaivite (devotees of Shiva) and Buddhist esoteric systems, as well as from Hatha Yoga.
