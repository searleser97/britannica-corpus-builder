Premonstratensian, byname White Canon, or Norbertine, member of Order of the Canons Regular of Prémontré, abbreviation O. Praem.,  a Roman Catholic religious order founded in 1120 by St. Norbert of Xanten, who, with 13 companions, established a monastery at Prémontré, Fr. The order combines the contemplative with the active religious life and in the 12th century provided a link between the strictly contemplative life of the monks of the preceding ages and the more active life of the friars of the 13th century. The Premonstratensians followed the monastic rule of life of St. Augustine, but their supplementary statutes, which were greatly influenced by Cistercian ideals in both the manner of life and the government of the order, made their life one of great austerity. The order was approved by Rome in 1126 and quickly spread over western Europe. Later, after its austerity had been relaxed, reforms were undertaken and a number of more or less independent congregations were created. The order was nearly destroyed by the French Revolution.
Its modern centre of strength is in Belgium, where there are several restored medieval abbeys. The members are engaged in the solemn public celebration of the liturgy and in the apostolate (religious activity) of preaching, pastoral work, mission work, and education. Their habit, or religious dress, is all white. Their abbot general resides in Rome.
