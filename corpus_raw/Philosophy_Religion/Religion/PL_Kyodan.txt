PL Kyōdan, in full Perfect Liberty Kyōdan,  religious group or church (Japanese: kyōdan) founded in Japan in 1946 by Miki Tokuchika. The movement, unique for the use of English words in its name, is based on the earlier Hito-no-michi sect. It is not affiliated, however, with any of the major religious traditions of Japan. In the late 20th century the group claimed more than 2.5 million adherents worldwide.
Headquarters of the sect are at Habikino, near Ōsaka. PL Kyōdan operates a hospital, a golf course, and other sports facilities. Considerable missionary activity is carried on in Japan and among Japanese living abroad.
PL Kyōdan teaches that the goal of man is joyful self-expression. Forgetting God brings misfortune and suffering, but the believer may pray that his troubles be transferred by divine mediation to his patriarch, who is strengthened for his vicarious suffering by the group’s collective prayers.
