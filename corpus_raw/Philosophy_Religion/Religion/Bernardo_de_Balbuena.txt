Bernardo de Balbuena,  (born 1568, Valdepeñas, Spain—died  Oct. 11, 1627, San Juan, P.R.), poet and first bishop of Puerto Rico, whose poetic descriptions of the New World earned him an important position among the greatest poets of colonial America.
Balbuena, taken to Mexico as a child, studied there and in Spain. Returning to the New World, he held minor church offices in Jamaica (1608) and became bishop of Puerto Rico (1620), remaining there until his death.
Balbuena is best remembered for two epic poems, La grandeza mexicana (1604; “The Greatness of Mexico”) and El Bernardo o la victoria de Roncesvalles (1624; “Bernardo; or, The Victory at Roncesvalles”), and for a collection of eclogues, El siglo de oro en las selvas de Erífile (1608; “The Golden Age in the Jungles of Erífile”). Much of his work was lost when his library was destroyed by the Dutch in the attack on San Juan in 1625.
