John Goodwin,  (born c. 1594, Norfolk, England—died  1665, London?), prominent English Puritan theologian and leader of the “New Arminians.”
Educated at Queen’s College, Cambridge, Goodwin served successively as rector of East Rainham, Norfolk (1625–33), and vicar of St. Stephen’s, Coleman Street, London (1633–45). He became a religious Independent and, when the Civil War erupted, actively supported the parliamentary cause. In A Bone for a Bishop (1643) he opposed the divine right of kings. Because of his Arminian beliefs, which opposed the Calvinist idea of absolute predestination, the House of Commons refused him a seat in the Westminster Assembly of Divines, but he nevertheless defended the minority views of its Independent members in his Theomachia (1644). The same year he organized the “visible saints” in his parish into a separate congregation, which included many of the important radicals in the revolutionary years. Goodwin championed numerous radical causes, including the army’s purge of Parliament in 1648, the execution of Charles I in 1649, and a denial of the state’s right to execute heretics. He supported the Leveller campaign for religious toleration and eventually embraced their republicanism. He did not, however, sanction Oliver Cromwell’s attempts to restructure the Church of England, believing that this would curtail religious freedom. Goodwin’s principal exposition of Arminian theology, which challenged the prevailing Calvinism of the period, appeared in 1651 as Redemption Redeemed. At the Restoration of Charles II (1660), Goodwin received an indemnity on condition that he accept no public position, but within a short time he resumed the pastorate of his gathered church in London. He died during the year of the Great Plague.
