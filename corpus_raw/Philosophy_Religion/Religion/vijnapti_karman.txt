Vijñapti-karman,   (Sanskrit: “manifest activity”), in Buddhist philosophy, a kind of action that manifests itself outside of the actor and is capable of being recognized by others. Of the three kinds of action (i.e., those produced by the body, mouth, and mind) usually admitted in Buddhism, bodily ones and verbal ones are classified as vijñapti-karman. But mind activity (i.e., will or thought) is considered as unmanifest action (avijñapti-karman). These actions, when they are finished, exert some effects on the agent according to the moral natures of the actions.
