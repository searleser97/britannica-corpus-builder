Daigak Guksa, also spelled Taegak Kuksa, secular name Ŭich’ŏn,  (born 1055, Korea—died  1101, Korea), Korean Buddhist priest who founded the Ch’ŏnt’ae sect of Buddhism.
A son of the Koryŏ king Munjong, Ŭich’ŏn became a Buddhist monk at age 11, and in 1084 he went to the Sung court of China and stayed a year and a half studying and collecting Buddhist literature. When Ŭich’ŏn returned home to Korea, he brought with him the doctrines of the Chinese T’ien T’ai (Korean pronunciation Ch’ŏnt’ae) sect of Buddhism. Ŭich’ŏn became the chief propagator of the Ch’ŏnt’ae sect in Korea; this sect attempted, with considerable popular success, to reconcile the conflicting doctrines of the two chief Buddhist sects in Korea, the Kyo, or Textual, School and the Sŏn (Chinese Ch’an, Japanese Zen) School. Ŭich’ŏn propagated the Ch’ŏnt’ae doctrine as one that adherents of both of the major schools could embrace. The Ch’ŏnt’ae doctrines initiated a new phase in the development of Buddhism in Korea; in particular they stimulated the reorganization of the Sŏn school into the Chogye school, and these three sects (Chogye, Textual, and Ch’ŏnt’ae) henceforth became the three main divisions of Buddhism in Korea.
In Korea Ŭich’ŏn also applied himself to collecting, cataloging, and publishing Buddhist writings. While working as a master priest at the Hŭngwang-sa temple, he published some 4,750 books of Buddhist scriptures he had collected, including the second publication of the Tripiṭaka (a complete collection of Buddhist scriptures) in Korea. He also published an authoritative catalogue of Buddhist sectarian writings.
