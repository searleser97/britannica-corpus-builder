Synod of Bishops,  in the Roman Catholic Church, the institution of periodic meetings of bishops established in 1965 by Pope Paul VI. According to the “Decree on the Bishops’ Pastoral Office in the Church” issued by the Second Vatican Council, the synod is convoked by the pope with the intention of assisting him in church government and of demonstrating the responsibility of bishops as a body for the universal church in addition to their individual responsibility in their respective dioceses.
The pope determines its procedures and agenda and appoints no more than 15 percent of the bishops. The rest of the delegates are elected by their respective national episcopal conferences or are ex officio members. In the years after its institution, the synod was convoked biennially, and the number of delegates averaged about 200. Issues discussed by the delegates included the nature of the priestly ministry, the putting into practice of the principle of collegiality, and the church’s obligations in promoting social justice. The procedures for synods are now incorporated in the second Code of Canon Law (1983).
