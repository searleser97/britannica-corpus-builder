Zhouli, (Chinese: “Rites of Zhou”) Wade-Giles romanization Chou-li, also called Zhouguan (“Offices of Zhou”),  one of three ancient ritual texts listed among the Nine, Twelve, and Thirteen Classics of Confucianism. Though tradition ascribed the text to the political figure Zhougong (flourished 12th century bc), the work is considered by modern scholars to have been an anonymous utopian “constitution” written perhaps about 300 bc. For many centuries Zhouli was joined to Liji (“Record of Rites”) and thus constituted one of the Six Classics (Liujing) of Chinese literature.
Influenced by legalist as well as Confucian ideas, Zhouli discusses government in general under the title “Offices of Heaven,” education under “Offices of Earth,” social and religious institutions under “Offices of Spring,” the army under “Offices of Summer,” justice under “Office of Autumn,” and population, territory, and agriculture under “Office of Winter.” In the 12th century Zhouli was given special recognition by being placed among the Six Classics as a substitute for the long-lost Classic of Music (Yuejing).
