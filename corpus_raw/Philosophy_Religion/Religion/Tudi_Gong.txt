Tudi Gong, (Chinese: “Lord of the Place,” “Earth Lord,” or “Earth God”) Wade-Giles romanization T’u-ti Kung,  in Chinese religion, a god whose deification and functions are determined by local residents. The chief characteristic of a Tudi Gong is the limitation of his jurisdiction to a single place—e.g., a bridge, a street, a temple, a public building, a private home, or a field. In the case of private homes, the Tudi Gong is often identified with the god of riches (Cai Shen). In all cases, a Tudi Gong is subservient to the Cheng Huang, the City God or spiritual magistrate.
In most cases these gods originated as historical persons who in life came to the assistance of their respective communities in times of need. It is supposed that, by deifying such persons and offering sacrifices to them, they will be moved to show similar solicitude after death. If misfortunes visit a locality, the Tudi Gong is judged to have lost interest and a new patron is chosen.
Some Chinese refer to Tudi Shen (“God of the Place”) and Tudi Ye (“Venerable God of the Place”), but there is nothing special about their name or function to distinguish them from any other “Place God.”
