Yao, formally Tangdi Yao,  in Chinese mythology, a legendary emperor (c. 24th century bce) of the golden age of antiquity, exalted by Confucius as an inspiration and perennial model of virtue, righteousness, and unselfish devotion. His name is inseparable from that of his successor Shun, to whom he gave his two daughters in marriage.
Legends recount that after 70 years of Yao’s rule, the sun and moon were as resplendent as jewels, the five planets shone like strung pearls, phoenixes nested in the palace courtyards, crystal springs flowed from the hills, pearl grass covered the countryside, rice crops were plentiful, two unicorns (omens of prosperity) appeared in the capital at Pingyang, and the wondrous calendar bean made its appearance, producing one pod each day for half a month before the 15 pods withered one by one on successive days.
Two remarkable events marked Yao’s reign: a rampaging flood was brought under control by Da Yu; and Hou Yi, the Lord Archer, saved the world from destruction by shooting down 9 of the 10 suns burning up the earth.
Like Fu Xi, Shennong, and Huangdi before him, Yao had special temples dedicated in his honour. He is said to have offered sacrifices and to have practiced divination. In choosing a successor, Yao bypassed his own less worthy son in favour of Shun and served as counselor to the new emperor.
