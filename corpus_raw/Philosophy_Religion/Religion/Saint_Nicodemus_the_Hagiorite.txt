Saint Nicodemus the Hagiorite, also called Saint Nicodemus Of The Holy Mountain,  (born 1748, Naxos Island, Ottoman Empire [now in Greece]—died  July 14, 1809, Mount Athos; canonized May 31, 1955), Greek Orthodox monk and author of ascetic prayer literature. He was influential in reviving the practice of Hesychasm, a Byzantine method of contemplative prayer.
Forced to flee Turkish persecution in the midst of his studies at Smyrna (now İzmir, Turkey), Nicodemus entered a monastery on Mount Athos. He was inspired to theological scholarship by a contemporary, Macarius of Corinth, whose collection of old Eastern prayer texts Nicodemus edited and published as Philokalia in 1782. After this book had occasioned a renewed interest in Hesychasm throughout the Orthodox churches, Nicodemus edited Macarius’ essays on liturgical prayer, emphasizing the Eucharist, or the Lord’s Supper. This work was at first criticized for erroneous doctrine, but its orthodoxy was vindicated by the Synod of Constantinople in 1819.
Nicodemus’ outstanding work, the Pedalion, or Rudder of the Ship of Knowledge, is a commentary on Greek church law. Its bias against the Latin church, although partly attributable to interpolations by another editor, reflects the author’s negative feelings toward the institutions of Western Christianity. Nicodemus did not hesitate, however, to use the treatises of Latin theologians on asceticism and contemplative prayer. His Enchiridion of Counsels (1801), a handbook on the religious life, continues to guide modern Greek spirituality. He was proclaimed a saint by the Greek Orthodox church in 1955.
