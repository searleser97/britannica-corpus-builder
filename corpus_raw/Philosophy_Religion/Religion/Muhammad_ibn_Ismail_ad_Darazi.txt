Muḥammad ibn Ismāʿīl ad-Darazī,  (born, Bukhara, Turkistan [now in Uzbekistan]—died  1019/20), propagandist for the Ismāʿīlī sect of Islam and the man for whom the religion of the Druze sect is named.
Ad-Darazī was probably at least part-Turkish and is believed to have traveled from Bukhara to Egypt as an Ismāʿīlī preacher in 1017/18. He gained favour with the Fāṭimid caliph al-Ḥākim and, together with Ḥamzah ibn ʿAlī and others, created a theology that was based upon the caliph’s divinity. According to ad-Darazī, the divine spirit that had been invested in Adam had been transmitted through successive imams to al-Ḥākim. Al-Ḥākim actively promoted the belief in his own divinity, and, when ad-Darazī publicly proclaimed the doctrine in the principal mosque of Cairo, rioting ensued that quite probably led to his own death. The Druze religion was named for ad-Darazī because his preaching established his preeminence among the founders in the public’s mind, even though Ḥamzah had been the first to organize the movement.
