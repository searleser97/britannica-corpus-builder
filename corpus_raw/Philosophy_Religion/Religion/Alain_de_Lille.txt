Alain de Lille, Latin Alanus de Insulis, English Alan of Lille,  (born c. 1128, probably Lille, Flanders [now in France]—died  1202, Cîteaux, France), theologian and poet so celebrated for his varied learning that he was known as “the universal doctor.”
Alain  studied and taught at Paris, lived for some time at Montpellier, and later joined the Cistercians in Cîteaux. As a theologian, he  shared in the mystic reaction of the second half of the 12th century against Scholastic philosophy, adopting an eclectic Scholasticism composed of rationalism and mysticism. In his apologetic works, he tried to prove by reason the tenets of Roman Catholicism in opposition to the opinions of unbelievers.  In this manner, his Tractatus contra haereticos  (“Treatise Against Heretics”) attempted to refute heterodoxy on rational grounds; and his Theologicae regulae  (“Maxims of Theology”) assumed that the principles of the faith are self-evident propositions.
Alain is noted in the history of medieval Latin literature for two poems: De planctu naturae (Lament of Nature), a clever satire on human vices, and Anticlaudianus, a lengthy allegory concerning the creation and perfection of the human soul by God and nature, theology and philosophy, the virtues and the arts.
