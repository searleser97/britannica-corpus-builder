St. Mother Théodore Guérin, original name Anne-Thérèse Guérin, also called Saint Theodora,  (born October 2, 1798, Étables, Côtes-du-Nord, France—died May 14, 1856, St. Mary-of-the-Woods, Indiana, U.S.; canonized 2006; feast day October 3), Franco-American religious leader who supervised the founding of a number of Roman Catholic schools in Indiana.
Anne-Thérèse Guérin entered the community of the Sisters of Providence at Ruillé-sur-Loir, France, in 1823, and in 1825 she took her final vows in the order as Sister Théodore. She was appointed superior of the order’s school in Rennes, and in 1833 she was transferred to the school at Soulaines. In 1840 she and five other sisters answered a call from the bishop of Vincennes, Indiana, to establish the order there. They arrived in October 1840 and established a convent near Terre Haute, Indiana, with Mother Théodore as superior and founder of the Sisters of Providence of St. Mary-of-the-Woods, the American branch of the Sisters of Providence. Within a month the first novices had been accepted into the convent, and in July 1841 the Institute of St. Mary’s, the first academy for girls in Indiana, was opened. It received a state charter in 1846 and eventually (1909) became Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College, the first Catholic liberal arts college for women in the United States. In her 16 years as superior of the American branch of the Sisters of Providence, Mother Théodore oversaw the establishment of the motherhouse and the opening of a number of schools throughout Indiana in addition to the Institute of St. Mary’s. She was beatified by Pope John Paul II on October 25, 1998, and canonized by Pope Benedict XVI on October 15, 2006.
