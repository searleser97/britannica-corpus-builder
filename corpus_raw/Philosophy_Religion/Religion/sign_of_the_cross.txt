Sign of the cross,  a gesture of ancient Christian origin by which people bless themselves, others, or objects. St. Cyprian explained the ritual in the 3rd century by reference to Christ’s redemptive death on the cross. The sign of the cross is used throughout Christian liturgies, in moments of need or danger, at the beginning and end of prayer, and on numerous other occasions.
In the Latin rite the sign is made in two ways: (1) the great sign, made with the five fingers outstretched (symbolic of the five wounds of Christ) on the forehead, breast, and shoulders, left to right, and (2) the lesser sign, made with the thumb alone on the forehead, lips, and breast. In the mass, the former is used when the priest blesses the congregation with the Trinitarian invocation “In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,” and the latter is commonly used prior to the Gospel reading.
In many Eastern churches, since the 7th century, the great sign has been made with two fingers (index and middle, sometimes said to be symbolic of the two natures in Christ, as opposed to the practice of some miaphysites of using the index finger alone) or, since the 8th century, with the five fingers curved, index and middle fingers touching the thumb (a Trinitarian symbol). The gesture moves from right to left. The earliest invocation made with the sign seems to have been simply “The sign of the cross” or “The sign of Christ.”
