Qiblah, also spelled qibla or kiblah,  the direction of the sacred shrine of the Kaaba in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, toward which Muslims turn five times each day when performing the salat (daily ritual prayer). Soon after Muhammad’s migration (Hijrah, or Hegira) to Medina in 622, he indicated Jerusalem as the qiblah, probably influenced by Jewish tradition. He later changed the qiblah to Mecca.
The qiblah is used not only for prayer but also for burial; the dead, including slaughtered animals, are interred facing Mecca. In a mosque the qiblah is indicated by the mihrab, a niche in the building’s interior wall facing Mecca.
