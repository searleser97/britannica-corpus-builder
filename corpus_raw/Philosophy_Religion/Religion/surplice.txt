Surplice,   white outer vestment worn by clergymen, acolytes, choristers, or other participants in Roman Catholic and in Anglican, Lutheran, and other Protestant religious services. It is a loose garment, usually with full sleeves. Originally the surplice was full length, but gradually it was shortened to the knees or above. In the 20th century some surplices were again made full length.
A modified alb, the surplice probably originated in the 11th century in France or England, where the girdled alb was given up in the cold climate and the surplice was worn for uniform appearance over fur-lined garments. It was adopted in Rome in the 13th century. After the Protestant Reformation (16th century), the surplice was retained by the Church of England, and it is the most common vestment worn by Anglican and many Lutheran clergymen. It has no counterpart in the Eastern churches.
