Sarvastivada, (Sanskrit: “Doctrine That All Is Real”)  also called Vaibhashika,  a school of early Buddhism. A fundamental concept in Buddhist metaphysics is the assumption of the existence of dharmas, cosmic factors and events that combine momentarily under the influence of a person’s past deeds to form a person’s life flux, which he considers his personality and career. Differences arose among the various early Buddhist schools concerning the ontological reality of these dharmas. While, like all Buddhists, the Sarvastivadins consider everything empirical to be impermanent, they maintain that the dharma factors are eternally existing realities. The dharmas are thought to function momentarily, producing the empirical phenomena of the world, which is illusory, but to exist outside the empirical world. In contrast, the Sautrantikas (those for whom the sutras, or the scriptures, are authoritative) maintained that the dharma factors are not eternal but momentary, and the only actually existing dharmas are the ones presently functioning.
The Sarvastivada school is also known as the Vaibhashika because of the c. 2nd-century-ce commentary Mahavibhasha (“Great Elucidation”). This text itself was commented upon by the important 4th- or 5th-century Buddhist thinker Vasubandhu in his Abhidharmakosha, prior to his conversion to the Mahayana tradition of Buddhism. Thus, elements of the Sarvastivada school came to influence Mahayana thought.
