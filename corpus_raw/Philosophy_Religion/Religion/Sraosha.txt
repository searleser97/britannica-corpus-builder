Sraosha,   in Zoroastrianism, divine being who is the messenger of Ahura Mazdā and the embodiment of the divine word. His name, related to the Avestan word for “hearing,” signifies man’s obedient hearkening to Ahura Mazdā’s word and also signifies Ahura Mazdā’s omnipresent listening. Sraosha is the medium between man and God. Zoroastrians believe that no ritual is valid without his presence, and he is very prominent in Zoroastrian liturgy. Depicted as a strong and holy youth whose heavenly abode is a thousand-pillared house, he has, in addition, a protective role. It is Sraosha that Ahura Mazdā sends to chastise the demons that harass men. Thrice nightly he descends to earth to combat them, crushing their skulls. His strongest weapon is prayer. In the end of time, he will be the agent of the final extermination of evil. Sraosha also leads the righteous soul through the ordeal of judgment three days after its body’s death.
