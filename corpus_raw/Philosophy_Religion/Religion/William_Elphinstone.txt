William Elphinstone,  (born 1431, Glasgow, Scot.—died  Oct. 25, 1514, Edinburgh), Scottish bishop and statesman, founder of the University of Aberdeen.
Elphinstone was probably the son of a priest and was educated at the University of Glasgow. He was ordained priest (c. 1456) and after four years as a country rector went abroad to the University of Paris, where he became reader in canon law; later he moved to Orléans. He returned to Scotland about 1471, was appointed rector of the University of Glasgow (1474), and served as official general of Glasgow diocese. He became bishop of Ross (1481) and was translated to Aberdeen (1483), but he was not consecrated until some years later. Elphinstone was sent by James III on embassies to Louis XI of France and to the English kings Edward IV, Richard III, and Henry VII and served James IV on similar diplomatic missions. He was lord chancellor for a few months in 1488 and became keeper of the privy seal in 1492.
Elphinstone’s later years were devoted mainly to the establishment of the University of Aberdeen and to the building of St. Mary’s College, afterward King’s College. The papal bull for the foundation was obtained in 1494, and the royal charter confirming Old Aberdeen as the university seat was granted in 1497. The university, modeled on those of Paris and Bologna and intended to include teaching in law, medicine, and divinity as well as in arts, soon became renowned. Elphinstone also was partially responsible for the introduction of printing into Scotland (1507).
