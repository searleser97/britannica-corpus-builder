William Watson,  (born April 23, 1559?—died  Dec. 9, 1603, Winchester, Hampshire, Eng.), English Roman Catholic priest who was executed for his part in the “Bye Plot” against King James I.
At the age of 16 Watson left England for France, where he was ordained priest in April 1586. Returning to England in June of that year, he spent the next 16 years in and out of prisons because of his illegal missionary activities. Although he was occasionally severely tortured, he always managed to escape or obtain release. During that period Watson became a prominent spokesman for the secular priests in their struggle with the Jesuits. He claimed that the political intrigues of the Jesuits with foreign countries, particularly Spain, were responsible for much of the persecution of English Catholics.
When Queen Elizabeth I died in 1603, Watson obtained from her successor, King James I, what he thought was a pledge of religious toleration for Roman Catholics. James’s failure to carry out this promise, however, prompted Watson to initiate a plot against the crown. Joined by a small group made up of Catholics and disgruntled Protestants, he made plans to seize the king at Greenwich and hold him until he acquiesced in their demands. Some Jesuit leaders revealed the scheme to the government, the plotters were immediately apprehended, and Watson was executed for treason. The episode was called the Bye Plot to distinguish it from another intrigue of the day, the Main Plot.
