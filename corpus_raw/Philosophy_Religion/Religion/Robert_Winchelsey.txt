Robert Winchelsey,  (died 1313, Otford, Kent, Eng.), archbishop of Canterbury who was a champion of clerical privilege and a leading opponent of kings Edward I and Edward II of England.
Winchelsey became chancellor of Oxford University by 1288, and in 1293 he was elected archbishop of Canterbury. He clashed with Edward I by publishing Pope Boniface VIIIâ€™s bull Clericis Laicos (1296) forbidding the clergy to pay taxes to lay rulers. Edward, who desperately needed money for his foreign wars, retaliated by outlawing the entire English clergy. Winchelsey remained defiant until Boniface agreed (1297) to permit clerical taxation for national defense. Further disputes arose between the King and Winchelsey, and in 1306 Pope Clement V allowed Edward to banish the Archbishop. On the accession of Edward II, Winchelsey was recalled. Nevertheless, he soon joined the baronial opposition to the royal favourite Piers Gaveston. Winchelsey was one of the lords ordainers who seized control of the administration in 1310, and two years later he excommunicated Gaveston.
At the time of his death, Winchelsey was popularly equated with Thomas Becket, the archbishop of Canterbury martyred by King Henry II.
