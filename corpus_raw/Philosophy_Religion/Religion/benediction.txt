Benediction,   a verbal blessing of persons or things, commonly applied to invocations pronounced in God’s name by a priest or minister, usually at the conclusion of a religious service. The Aaronic benediction (Num. 6:24–26) was incorporated by Luther into his German Mass and is preserved by modern Lutherans because of its impressive dignity; it is also used in the Mozarabic liturgy of Spain before the reception of the Host. The Swedish liturgy appends a trinitarian formula to this same benediction. Some Christian churches, however, prefer the Pauline benediction (II Cor. 13:14).
In the Roman Catholic Church benediction commonly means a blessing of persons (e.g., the sick) or objects (e.g., religious articles). Benediction of the blessed sacrament, a nonliturgical devotional service, has as its central act the blessing of the congregation with the eucharistic Host.
