The Proverbs, also called The Book Of Proverbs,  an Old Testament book of “wisdom” writing found in the third section of the Jewish canon, known as the Ketuvim, or Writings. The book’s superscription, “The proverbs of Solomon. . . ,” is not to say that it as a whole or even individual proverbs should be credited to King Solomon, for scholarly examination discloses that it contains seven collections of wisdom materials (mostly short sayings) from a wide variety of periods, all after Solomon’s time.
The earliest collection (25:1–29:27), titled “proverbs of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied,” came into being about 700 bc; the latest (1:1–9:18) dates from the 4th century bc. There also is an untitled acrostic poem about the virtuous wife (31:10–31).
The third collection (22:17–24:22) has attracted much attention because of its close affinity to the Egyptian “Wisdom of Amenemope,” variously dated between the 10th and 6th centuries bc. This likeness suggests that Israel’s wisdom movement, whatever its origins, was influenced by the wisdom literature of other ancient Middle Eastern cultures.
