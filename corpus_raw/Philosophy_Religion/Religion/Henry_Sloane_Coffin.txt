Henry Sloane Coffin,  (born Jan. 5, 1877, New York City—died  Nov. 25, 1954, Lakeville, Conn., U.S.), American clergyman, author, and educator who led in the movement for liberal evangelicalism in Protestant churches.
After serving as minister of two Presbyterian churches in New York City (1900–26), he became president (1926–45) of Union Theological Seminary, also in New York City. Preaching throughout the United States, Coffin emphasized the application of Christianity to social problems.
Coffin also sought to improve the quality of theological education. He served as a fellow (1922–45) of the Corporation of Yale University, and during 1943–44 he was moderator of the general assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. Among his more than 20 books in the field of religion, his Meaning of the Cross (1931) is considered an excellent guide to Christian theology.
