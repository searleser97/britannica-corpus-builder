Shabbetaianism, also spelled Sabbetaianism,  in Judaism, a 17th-century messianic movement that, in its extreme form, espoused the sacredness of sin. The leader of the movement was Shabbetai Tzevi, a self-proclaimed messiah and charismatic mystic. Coerced by the sultan of Constantinople to accept Islam, Shabbetai Tzevi shocked and disillusioned many of his followers by proclaiming himself a Muslim.
Other followers, interpreting Shabbetai Tzevi’s apostasy as a step toward ultimate fulfillment of his messiahship, also proclaimed themselves Muslims. They argued that such outward acts were irrelevant as long as one remains inwardly a Jew. Those who embraced the theory of “sacred sin” believed that the Torah (“Law” or “Teaching”) could be fulfilled only by its seeming annulment. Others felt they could remain faithful Shabbetaians without having to apostatize.
After Shabbetai Tzevi’s death in 1676, the sect continued to flourish. The nihilistic tendencies of Shabbetaianism reached a peak in the 18th century with the false messiah Jacob Frank, who claimed to be Shabbetai Tzevi’s reincarnation and whose followers reputedly sought redemption through orgies at mystical festivals. The confusion and ill feeling ran so deep among the Jewish communities that a strong aversion to Kabbala (Jewish mysticism) and active messianic tendencies developed in response.
