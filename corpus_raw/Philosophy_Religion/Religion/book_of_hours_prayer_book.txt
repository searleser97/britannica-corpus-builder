Book of hours,  devotional book widely popular in the later Middle Ages. The book of hours began to appear in the 13th century, containing prayers to be said at the canonical hours in honour of the Virgin Mary. The growing demand for smaller such books for family and individual use created a prayerbook style enormously popular among the wealthy. The demand for the books was crucial to the development of Gothic illumination. These lavishly decorated texts, of small dimensions, varied in content according to their patrons’ desires.
One of the most splendid examples, the Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry (c. 1409–16), was created in northern France during the 14th and 15th centuries. Now held in Chantilly at the Musée Condé, it is an excellent pictorial record of the duke’s spectacular residences, with magnificent calendar pages illuminated by the Limbourg brothers, as well as many biblical scenes and illustrations of the lives of the saints. Other renowned examples are the Hours of Jeanne d’Evreux (c. 1325), now held in The Cloisters in New York City, and the Book of Hours of Charles of Angoulême and the Livres d’Heures de Rohan in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris.
