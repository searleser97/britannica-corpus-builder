Visitandine, member of Visitation Order, formally Congregation of the Visitation of Holy Mary (V.H.M.),  a Roman Catholic order of nuns founded by St. Francis de Sales and St. Jane Frances de Chantal at Annecy, Fr., in 1610. The order was originally destined for charitable work, visiting and caring for the sick and poor in their homes, as well as for prayer. But, after five years of this work, the founders were obliged to accept a rule of strict enclosure, or cloistered life, which at the time was considered an indispensable adjunct of the religious life for women. Although Francis de Sales did not intend for the Visitation nuns to embrace the teaching apostolate, they nevertheless were conducting private academies before 1641. In modern times many Visitandines are devoted to education. The unifying apostolate of the order is the spread of devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. When Francis de Sales died in 1622, there were 13 monasteries; in 1641, the year of Jane de Chantalâ€™s death, the number was 85; on the eve of the French Revolution, the order numbered nearly 200 monasteries, with about 7,000 religious. In the late 20th century there were about 190 monasteries.
