Barong,  masked figure, usually representing an unidentified creature called keket, who appears at times of celebration in Bali, Indonesia. For the Balinese, Barong is the symbol of health and good fortune, in opposition to the witch, Rangda (also known as Calonarang). During a dance-drama that includes the famous kris (heirloom sword) dance, in which deeply entranced performers turn swords on themselves but emerge unharmed, Barong confronts Rangda in magical combat. Barong is brought to life by two dancers encased in an ornately decorated harness. From the figureâ€™s mask hangs a beard of human hair decorated with frangipani flowers, in which the magic power of Barong is thought to reside.
