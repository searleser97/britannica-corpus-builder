Dōgen, also called Jōyō Daishi, or Kigen Dōgen,  (born Jan. 19, 1200, Kyōto, Japan—died  Sept. 22, 1253, Kyōto), leading Japanese Buddhist during the Kamakura period (1192–1333), who introduced Zen to Japan in the form of the Sōtō school (Chinese: Ts’ao-tung). A creative personality, he combined meditative practice and philosophical speculation.
Dōgen was born into a family of the court nobility and was orphaned at the age of seven. He was ordained a monk at 13 and studied the holy scriptures of Buddhism on Mount Hiei, the centre of Tendai Buddhism, without, however, fully satisfying his spiritual aspirations. Between 1223 and 1227 he studied Zen meditation in China and gained enlightenment under the Zen master Ju-ching. Back in Japan again, he lived at various temples and worked for the spread of Zen practice. He spent his last years at Eihei Temple, which he had founded on a hill in present-day Fukui. His first literary work, Fukan zazen gi (1227; “General Teachings for the Promotion of Zazen”), contains a brief introduction to the Zen practice. He wrote a number of other instructive works as well. His chief work, Shōbōgenzō (1231–53; “Treasury of the True Dharma Eye”), containing 95 chapters and written over a period of more than 20 years, consists of his elaboration of Buddhist principles. Dōgen taught shikan taza, “zazen only,” zazen signifying the Zen practice of meditation in the cross-legged (lotus) position. He stressed the identity of practice and enlightenment.
