Randall Thomas Davidson, Baron Davidson,  (born April 7, 1848, Edinburgh, Scotland—died May 25, 1930, London, England), Anglican archbishop of Canterbury who was prominent as a speaker in parliamentary debates on moral and national questions during his 25-year tenure.
Ordained in 1875, Davidson became resident chaplain two years later to the archbishop of Canterbury, Archibald C. Tait. He soon won the trust of Queen Victoria, whose influence obtained his appointment as dean of Windsor cathedral in 1883, bishop of Rochester in 1891, and bishop of Winchester in 1895. In 1903 he succeeded Frederick Temple as archbishop of Canterbury.
Noted as a commonsense moderate, Davidson sought to reconcile extremists in the disputes between 1902 and 1906 over religious instruction in schools and the amount of ritual appropriate for worship services. His speech in the House of Lords was decisive in persuading other Anglican bishops to support Prime Minister Herbert Asquith’s effort to curb the powers of that house, finally accomplished by a bill passed in 1911. Active in the ecumenical movement, Davidson served as president of the Lambeth Conference in 1920 and encouraged closer ties with the Eastern Orthodox churches. These activities helped increase the influence of the Church of England abroad, and missionaries frequently sought Davidson’s advice. Though his proposals for revision of the Book of Common Prayer were rejected by the House of Commons, he was instrumental as chairman of the Church Assembly set up in 1919 and helped guide it through its early years. On his retirement from Canterbury in 1928, he was created a baron; he had a childless marriage, and the barony lapsed upon his death. Among his writings are Life of Archbishop Tait, 2 vol. (1891), and The Character and Call of the Church of England (1912).
