Abhdisho bar Berikha, also called Ebedjesus Of Nisibis,  (died November 1318), Syrian Christian theologian and poet who was the last important representative of the Nestorian tradition, a theological school emphasizing a rational, critical interpretation of early Christian doctrine. The sect, centred in ancient Antioch, countered the speculative mysticism then prevalent in Alexandria and Jerusalem.
Appointed bishop of Shiggar and Beth-Arabaye (Syria) about 1285, Abhdisho became, by 1291, metropolitan (senior bishop over a larger province) of Nisibis (now Nusaybin, Tur.) and Armenia. Most notable of his works is Margaritha vitae (“The Pearl of Life”), considered to be one of the most comprehensive statements of late Nestorian teaching. The “Pearl” focussed on the issue of Christ’s psychological identity. Reacting against the pietistic element of Greek and Oriental Christianity, which accented Christ as simply the divinity in human form rather than as a distinct individual, Abhdisho argued that Jesus experienced completely the biological and psychological functions of an integral, human person in feelings, mind, and will. Such a view was motivated by the Nestorian concern for an effective and authentic meaning to Christ’s moral example and sacrifice on behalf of the human race.
Abhdisho also wrote the metrically structured Catalogue (1316), which is not only a list of his own works but also the best reference known for the writings of Nestorian Syrian and Greek churchmen-theologians and a valuable source on Syrian literary life.
