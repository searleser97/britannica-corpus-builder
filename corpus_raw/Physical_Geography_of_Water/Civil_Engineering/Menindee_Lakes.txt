Menindee Lakes,   series of reservoirs, part of the Darling River Conservation Scheme, western New South Wales, Australia, near the town of Menindee. Primarily natural features, the lakes are flooded through creeks linking them, at high water, eastward to the Darling River, which has been dammed for back drainage. They include Lakes Menindee, Tandou, Pamamaroo, and Cawndilla and several smaller lakes. The total capacity of the Menindee Lakes Storage Scheme (for domestic and industrial water and irrigation), which was begun in 1949 and completed in 1960, is 2,000,000 acre-feet (2,467,000,000 cubic m). Lakes Menindee and Cawndilla are part of Kinchega National Park. Menindee is an Aboriginal term meaning “egg yolk.”
