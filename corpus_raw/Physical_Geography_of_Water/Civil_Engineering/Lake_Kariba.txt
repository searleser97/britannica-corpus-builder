Lake Kariba,  lake in central Africa, between Zambia and Zimbabwe. It was formed by damming the Zambezi River in the Kariba Gorge, where the river narrows between hills of hard rock 250 miles (400 km) below Victoria Falls. After 1960 the hydroelectric facilities of the Kariba Dam served the towns of Zambia, the Harare (formerly Salisbury) and Bulawayo areas, and the southern part of Zimbabwe. The lake, covering about 2,000 square miles (5,200 square km), extends upstream 175 miles (280 km) to Devilâ€™s Gorge and has a maximum width of 30 miles (48 km), with a deeply indented shore and many islands. Its depth is irregular (295 feet [90 m] near the dam), and its full capacity is 146,415,000 acre-feet (180,600,000,000 cubic m). The overall project included four harbour sites, the resettlement of river dwellers, the rescue of game, and the introduction of Tilapia fish to the waters to give a 15,000-ton yield annually.
