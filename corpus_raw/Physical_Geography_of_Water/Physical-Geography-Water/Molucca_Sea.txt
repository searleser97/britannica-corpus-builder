Molucca Sea, Indonesian Laut Maluku,  portion of the western Pacific Ocean, bounded by the Indonesian islands of Celebes (west), Halmahera (east), and the Sula group (south). With a total surface area of 77,000 square miles (200,000 square km), the Molucca Sea merges with the Ceram Sea to the southeast, with the Banda Sea to the south, and with the open Pacific through the 150-mile- (240-kilometre-) wide Molucca Passage to the northeast. The seaâ€™s floor is subdivided into three zones, which serve to conduct deep water from the Pacific to the lesser seas. The deepest depression of the Molucca Sea is the 15,780-foot (4,810-metre) Batjan (Bacan) basin. This area of the Pacific often experiences earthquakes and crustal warping.
