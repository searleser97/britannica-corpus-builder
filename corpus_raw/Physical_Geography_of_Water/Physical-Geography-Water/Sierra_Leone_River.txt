Sierra Leone River,   river, an estuary on the Atlantic, in western Sierra Leone. Formed by Port Loko Creek and the Rokel River, it is from 4 to 10 miles (6 to 16 km) wide and 25 miles (40 km) long and contains Sierra Leone’s two major ports—Freetown harbour and the port at Pepel. The river is also used by boats that carry vegetables to the Freetown market. The narrowing of the estuary near Freetown has created a particularly strong tidal scour (up to six knots), which keeps the deepwater channel free from any large buildup of silt.
