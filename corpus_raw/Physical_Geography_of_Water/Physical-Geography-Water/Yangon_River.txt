Yangon River, also called Rangoon River,  marine estuary in southern Myanmar (Burma), formed at the city of Yangon (Rangoon) by the confluence of the Pegu and Myitmaka rivers. It empties into the Gulf of Martaban of the Andaman Sea, 25 miles (40 km) southeast. Linked west to the Irrawaddy River by the Twante Canal (first dug in 1883), it is the main access channel to Yangon and can accommodate oceangoing vessels.
