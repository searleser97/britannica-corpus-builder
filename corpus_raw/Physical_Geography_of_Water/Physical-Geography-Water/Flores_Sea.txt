Flores Sea, Bahasa Indonesia Laut Flores,  portion of the western South Pacific Ocean, bounded on the north by the island of Celebes (Sulawesi) and on the south by the Lesser Sunda Islands of Flores and Sumbawa. Occupying a total surface area of 93,000 square miles (240,000 square km), it opens northwest through Makassar Strait to the Celebes Sea, west to the Java Sea, and east to the Banda Sea. Teluk (gulf of) Bone cuts deeply into the Celebes coast. The seaâ€™s basin is divided into four physiographic areas. In the west is a broad plateau at a general depth of 1,650 feet (500 metres); submarine mounts rise from this bank and are often capped by coral atolls. In the south is the Flores Basin (just north of the island of Flores), where the sea plunges to its greatest depth, 16,860 feet (5,140 metres). To the north of this trough, two ridges (the western reaching above water as Selayar Island) flank a shallower trough (maximum 11,060 feet [3,370 metres]) that stretches to the island of Celebes. The last region, south of Teluk Bone, is on the east, bordering the Banda Sea. In the winter, surface currents trend southwest only to reverse themselves during the summer.
