Holstein Sea,  former body of water that occupied the North and Baltic sea basins and deposited marine sediments over a wide area. This marine transgression occurred during the Holstein Interglacial Stage of the Pleistocene Epoch (approximately 2.6 million to 11,700 years ago). The Holstein Interglacial Stage occurred in the middle Pleistocene, prior to the Eemian Interglacial Stage. The fossils of the Holstein Sea deposits show a change from cold to temperate water conditions. The Holstein Sea flooded many land areas, as demonstrated by the correlation of marine and terrestrial sediments.
