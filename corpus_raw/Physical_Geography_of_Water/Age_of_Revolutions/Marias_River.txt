Marias River,  river in Glacier county, northwestern Montana, U.S. It is formed by the confluence of Cut Bank, Dupuyer, and Birch creeks and Two Medicine River and flows generally southeastward. The river is impounded by the Tiber Dam to form Lake Elwell, a reservoir used for irrigation and recreation. Beyond the dam it flows for 50 miles (80 km) to enter the Missouri River at Loma. Used by pioneer and trading expeditions, the Marias was named in 1804 by the explorer Meriwether Lewis for his cousin Maria Wood. In 1806 Lewis proceeded up the river to a point near the site of Cut Bank, where Fort Piegan, an American Fur Company trading post, was established in 1831. The river was the site of one of the bloodiest incidents of the Indian Wars when, on January 23, 1870, U.S. soldiers killed 173 Piegan, Blackfoot, and Blood Indians, mostly elderly men, women, and children, in an event that came to be known as the Marias Massacre. The Marias River receives its principal tributary, the Teton River, at Loma, near its junction with the Missouri.
