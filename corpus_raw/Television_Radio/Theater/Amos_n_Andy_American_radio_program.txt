Amos ‘n’ Andy Show,  popular radio and television program that had its roots in a 1926 radio program called Sam ‘n’ Henry. Because the Amos ‘n’ Andy radio show was based on the model of minstrel shows, thus based on racial stereotypes, and was voiced by two white entertainers from the late 1920s to 1951, it was considered highly objectionable.
Created by entertainers Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll—who also were the sole writers for the show during the first decade of its life—the Amos ‘n’ Andy radio show debuted in 1928 on Chicago radio station WMAQ. Gosden played Amos, an earnest and hardworking young black man, and Correll played Andy, his more worldly, somewhat shiftless friend. The two white actors adopted stereotypical dialect, intonations, and character traits that had been established in the blackface minstrel tradition in the 1800s.
The radio show quickly gained a large audience, and from 1929 on it was broadcast nightly from coast to coast on NBC radio. The show became a national craze and a radio institution. It continued in its nightly serial format until 1943, when it was revamped as a weekly situation comedy, The Amos ‘n’ Andy Show, which lasted until 1955. Gosden and Correll carried on in a final radio incarnation, The Amos ‘n’ Andy Music Hall, until 1960.
In 1951 CBS launched the Amos ‘n’ Andy television series, with African American actors Alvin Childress and Spencer Williams, Jr., playing Amos and Andy, respectively. The show was the first TV series to feature an all-black cast.
Not long after the TV series began to air, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) launched a protest of the Amos ‘n’ Andy Show, criticizing its negative stereotypes of African Americans. CBS finally canceled the show in 1953, though the show remained in syndication until the mid-1960s.
