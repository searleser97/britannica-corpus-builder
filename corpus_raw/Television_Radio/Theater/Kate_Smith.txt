Kate Smith, byname of Kathryn Elizabeth Smith,  (born May 1, 1909, Greenville, Va., U.S.—died June 17, 1986, Raleigh, N.C.), American singer on radio and television, long known as the “first lady of radio.”
Smith started singing before audiences as a child, and by age 17 she had decided on a career in show business. She went to New York City in 1926 and landed a role in a Broadway musical, Honeymoon Lane, the same year. In a succession of Broadway shows she had little chance to sing, however; she was wanted mainly for comic “fat girl” roles that she despised. Her chance as a full-time singer came in 1930 when she met Ted Collins, an executive with Columbia Records. He became her manager and guided her career until his death in 1964. Collins helped her develop the radio show “Kate Smith Sings” (CBS, 1931–47), one of the most popular programs of the 1930s and early ’40s. On her first broadcast she adopted “When the Moon Comes over the Mountain” as her theme song (she had helped to write its lyrics). The song that she is perhaps most closely associated with, however, is Irving Berlin’s “God Bless America,” which she introduced on Armistice Day, 1938, and for which the composer granted her exclusive rights to sing on the air for some time. That same year Smith added a daytime radio talk program, “Kate Smith Speaks,” to her schedule, and by the 1940s she was known as the “first lady of radio.” In 1939 President Franklin D. Roosevelt introduced her to King George VI of England by saying, “This is Kate Smith. Miss Smith is America.” Of her more than 2,000 recordings, 19 sold more than a million copies each. During World War II she sold more war bonds than anyone else—$600 million worth—and she entertained troops throughout the country with her traveling show. Smith remained on daytime radio until 1954, and from 1950 to 1954 she hosted a daytime television show, “The Kate Smith Hour.” She also starred in the television shows “The Kate Smith Evening Hour” (NBC, 1951–52) and “The Kate Smith Show” (CBS, 1960). She made her concert debut at Carnegie Hall in New York City in 1963. Smith wrote two volumes of autobiography, Living in a Great Big Way (1938) and Upon My Lips a Song (1960) and in 1958 published her Company’s Coming Cookbook. In 1982 she was awarded the U.S. Medal of Freedom.
