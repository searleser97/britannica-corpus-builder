Ed Sullivan, byname of Edward Vincent Sullivan,  (born September 28, 1901, New York, New York, U.S.—died October 13, 1974, New York City), American television personality who was best known as the master of ceremonies of the immensely popular early TV variety program first known as Toast of the Town (1948–55) and later as The Ed Sullivan Show (1955–71). It presented a wide variety of  types of entertainment acts, and Sullivan was noted—and teased—for his stiff, almost uncomfortable demeanour and for his terse way of introducing guest performers; his usually reserved manner won him the sobriquet “the Great Stone Face.”
Sullivan, who was the son of a New York City customs inspector, played various sports in high school and later started a career in journalism as a sportswriter. While at The Evening Graphic in 1929, he also began covering Broadway, and he continued writing about show business when he joined the New York Daily News in 1932.  He became known for his talent at discovering and publicizing interesting new performers. CBS hired him after televising him at work as master of ceremonies of a promotional Harvest Moon Ball sponsored by the Daily News.
On the first Toast of the Town show, he introduced a concert pianist, a boxing referee, and a singing fireman as well as such celebrities as the composer and librettist Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II and the comedians Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. That vaudeville-like variety of guests continued throughout the show’s run. Although it struggled to find its footing initially, the program soon gained such a large audience that it became a Sunday night institution and remained enormously popular for more than two decades. Sullivan ignited the careers of many of his guests and championed African American musicians and comedians. His two most iconic shows featured performances by Elvis Presley (1956) and the Beatles (1964). In 1968 the theatre in which The Ed Sullivan Show took place was named for Sullivan.
