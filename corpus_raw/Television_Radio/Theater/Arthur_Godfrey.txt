Arthur Godfrey, in full Arthur Morton Godfrey,  (born August 31, 1903, New York City, New York—died March 16, 1983, New York City), American radio and television entertainer widely popular in the 1940s and ’50s, whose many broadcast programs launched the careers of numerous popular singers and other entertainers.
The child of a newspaperman-author-lecturer, Arthur Godfrey grew up in New Jersey not far from New York City. At the age of 14 he abandoned high school and ran away from home. After three years of working at nondescript jobs he enlisted in the U.S. Navy, where he was trained to be a radio operator. After serving for four years he enlisted in the U.S. Coast Guard in 1927, and with this turn his career as an entertainer began; he became involved with Coast Guard entertainment programs. A Coast Guard program put him in touch with the Baltimore radio station WFBR, and when he was released from the service he found employment there, first as a singer, then announcing, and eventually as station manager.
When Godfrey first eased into programs of his own, his relaxed manner and quick rapport with other performers made listeners feel part of the group. He found that an occasional good-humoured retort to advertising copy he was reading would entertain and still sell the product. In the 1940s his casual, affable banter with guests on the air had become so popular that he had two programs daily and one weekly on the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) for several years. His format, which he successfully transferred to television, was an easygoing and unself-conscious variety show.
In 1959 Godfrey was stricken with lung cancer. Although he recovered from it, he did not return to radio until 1972; he never made a successful comeback on television. Godfrey was proud of his association with the Navy and Coast Guard, and he was a reserve naval officer.
