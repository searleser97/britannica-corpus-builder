Clifton Fadiman, in full Clifton Paul Fadiman,  (born May 15, 1904, Brooklyn, N.Y., U.S.—died June 20, 1999, Sanibel Island, Fla.), American editor, anthologist, and writer known for his extraordinary memory and his wide-ranging knowledge.
Fadiman was the son of Russian-Jewish immigrants, and he early became an avid and voracious reader. After graduating from Columbia University, New York City, in 1925, he taught school and then became an editor in the publishing firm of Simon & Schuster. He was book editor of The New Yorker magazine from 1933 to 1943, and from 1938 to 1948 he was master of ceremonies of the popular radio program Information Please, on which he and such panelists as Franklin P. Adams, John Kieran, and Oscar Levant used questions submitted by listeners as occasions for an entertaining display of wit and erudition.
From 1944 to 1993 he was a member of the editorial board of the Book-of-the-Month Club, and from 1959 to 1998 he was a member of the Board of Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica. At various times he was a magazine columnist, a television host, and an essayist, but it was as an anthologist that he made his most lasting contributions. Among the volumes aimed at introducing readers of all ages to the joys of literature are Reading I’ve Liked (1941), The American Treasury (1955), Fantasia Mathematica (1958), The World Treasury of Children’s Literature (1984–85), and Treasury of the Encyclopædia Britannica (1992). He also wrote Party of One (collected magazine columns, 1955), Any Number Can Play (1957), Enter Conversing (1962), and The Joys of Wine (with Sam Aaron, 1975).
