Viacom Inc.,,   one of the largest and foremost communications and media conglomerates in the United States. The present form of the corporation dates from 1994 when Viacom Inc., which owned radio and television stations and cable television programming services and systems, acquired the entertainment and publishing giant Paramount Communications Inc. and then merged with the video and music retailer Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. Headquarters are in New York City.
Viacom was formed in 1971 by CBS Inc. to operate cable TV systems and to syndicate such popular CBS series as I Love Lucy after the Federal Communications Commission prohibited television networks from performing such activities. In 1976 it established the Showtime movie network, and in 1985 it bought the MTV networks, including the music video channels MTV and VH-1 as well as the Nickolodeon channel for children. In 1987 Viacom became a wholly owned subsidiary of the National Amusements Inc. movie theatre chain. It continued to expand, acquiring more radio and television stations, adding cable channels and franchises, and producing films for Showtime and several popular television series for the networks.
In 1994 Viacom acquired Paramount Communications Inc., a media conglomerate that had been founded in 1958 as Gulf + Western Corporation. Among the major businesses Paramount brought to Viacom were Paramount Pictures Corporation, Simon & Schuster, Inc., and Madison Square Garden (later sold by Viacom). Viacom’s subsequent merger with Blockbuster added video rental and music retail operations to its considerable film, cable, television, and publishing holdings, making it one of the most diversified entertainment companies in the world.
In 1995 Viacom’s Paramount unit and Chris-Craft Industries launched a new broadcasting network called United Paramount Network.
