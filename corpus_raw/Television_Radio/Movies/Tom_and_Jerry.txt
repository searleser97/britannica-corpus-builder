Tom and Jerry,  American animated cartoon series about a hapless cat’s never-ending pursuit of a clever mouse.
Not yet named in their debut theatrical short, Puss Gets the Boot (1940), Tom (the scheming cat) and Jerry (the spunky mouse) nonetheless were a hit with audiences. Animators William Hanna and Joseph Barbera produced more than 100 episodes for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). Several of these—including Yankee Doodle Mouse (1943), The Cat Concerto (1946), and Johann Mouse (1952)—won Academy Awards for best animated short subject. In most episodes Jerry foiled Tom’s efforts to catch him and lived to annoy him another day—though occasionally Tom got the upper hand, or the two would join forces against a common enemy. The series was driven entirely by action and visual humour; the characters almost never spoke.
After Hanna and Barbera left MGM, the series was revived several times, most notably in the mid-1960s under the direction of famed animator Chuck Jones. These later versions changed certain elements of the series and softened the violence. The shorts became popular on television, and Hanna and Barbera’s own company acquired the rights to create new Tom and Jerry episodes specifically for the small screen, producing 48 stories between 1975 and 1977. The show remained a television staple for decades, although racist or other offensive elements from the early features were usually edited.
Tom and Jerry: The Movie premiered in 1992 in Europe and appeared on American screens the following year. In 2006 Warner Bros. debuted a new television series, Tom and Jerry Tales, which was closely modeled after the original theatrical shorts. Tom and Jerry (2021), a mix of live action and animation, was a surprise box office hit, grossing more than $100 million worldwide.
