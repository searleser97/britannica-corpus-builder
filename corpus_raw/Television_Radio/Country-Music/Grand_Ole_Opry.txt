Grand Ole Opry, also called Opry,  country music show in Nashville, Tenn., U.S., which began weekly radio broadcasts in December 1925, playing traditional country or hillbilly music. Founded by George Dewey Hay, who had helped organize a similar program, the WLS “National Barn Dance,” in Chicago, the show was originally known as the “WSM Barn Dance,” acquiring its lasting name in 1926. It was largely Hay, called “the Solemn Ol’ Judge,” who determined the course of the Opry’s development.
The show flourished through the heyday of radio and on into the television era. Such widening exposure led to tours of Opry stars and in the 1940s to Opry films. The music of the Opry developed from Uncle Dave Macon’s ballads of rural labourers in the 1920s, through the string bands, cowboy music, and western swing of the 1930s, and back to the traditional music characterized by the career of Roy Acuff, who was promoted into stardom by the Opry in the late 1930s. After World War II, the honky-tonk style of Ernest Tubb, the bluegrass music of Bill Monroe with Earl Scruggs, the honky-tonk music of Hank Williams, the crooning of Eddy Arnold and Tennessee Ernie Ford, and the singing of such female vocalists as Kitty Wells were all Opry staples, as were comedy routines, notably by Minnie Pearl. In 1941 the Opry became a live stage show at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville; in 1974 the show moved to the Opryland amusement park and entertainment centre. The Opry initiated and promoted the creation of Nashville as the centre of country music.
