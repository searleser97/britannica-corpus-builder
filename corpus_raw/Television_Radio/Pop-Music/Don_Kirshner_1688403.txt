Don Kirshner managed singers Bobby Darin and Connie Francis before forming Aldon Music in 1958 with veteran publisher Al Nevins.  Setting up office in the heart of Tin Pan Alley on Broadway across from the Brill Building, they cultivated prolific songwriting partnerships including those of Neil Sedaka and Howard Greenfield and of Gerry Goffin and Carole King, whose well-honed songs for Francis, Bobby Vee, the Drifters, and the Shirelles helped New York City pop wrench the teenage market away from the spontaneous rock-and-roll artists who had unearthed it.
With song-plugger and producer Lou Adler among Kirshner’s lieutenants, Aldon merged with the film company Screen Gems Columbia. Kirshner channeled his songs through the company’s Colpix, Dimension, and Colgems subsidiary labels and masterminded a television project in which four young men were to become “America’s answer to the Beatles.”  The Monkees had six Top Three singles and two of the best-selling albums of the decade, mostly written by in-house songwriters—including Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart, Neil Diamond, and Goffin and King.  Setting up a West Coast office under music business veteran Lester Sill (previously the business partner of Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, Lee Hazlewood, and Phil Spector), Kirshner was involved in such other network TV ventures as the Archies cartoon project, The Partridge Family (which launched David Cassidy), and Don Kirshner’s Rock Concert (a live rock show).
