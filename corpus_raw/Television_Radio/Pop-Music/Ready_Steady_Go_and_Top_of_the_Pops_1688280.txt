The beat group boom that reinvigorated British pop music in the 1960s reached the nation’s television screens in February 1963, when the Beatles appeared on Independent Television’s (ITV’s) Thank Your Lucky Stars, followed in July by the Rolling Stones. However, it was ITV’s Ready Steady Go!, launched that August, and the British Broadcasting Corporation’s Top of the Pops, which debuted in January 1964, that became essential weekly viewing for hip and not-so-hip fans alike. It was no coincidence that Ready Steady Go!’s life span—by the end of 1966 it was all over—precisely matched that of the mod era of youth-oriented fashion and consumerism; the show relayed “Swinging London’s” music, style, and attitude to the rest of the country with minimum delay and maximum excitement, and it was arguably the most memorable “televisation” of the pop experience. Top of the Pops was more predictable, reflecting what British record buyers were already listening to, and continued to survive, with an essentially unaltered format.
