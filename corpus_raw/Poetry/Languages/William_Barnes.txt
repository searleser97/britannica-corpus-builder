William Barnes,  (born Feb. 22, 1801, Bagber, near Sturminster Newton, Dorsetshire, Eng.—died  Oct. 7, 1886, Winterbourne Came, Dorsetshire), English dialect poet whose work gives a vivid picture of the life and labour of rural southwestern England and includes some moving expressions of loss and grief, such as “The Wife A-Lost” and “Woak Hill.” He was also a gifted philologist, and his linguistic theories as well as his poetry influenced two major writers, Thomas Hardy and Gerard Manley Hopkins.
After leaving school at 15, Barnes worked for a solicitor, studied classics with local clergymen, and opened a school in 1823. He later took a Cambridge degree and was ordained as an Anglican priest in 1847. His first Dorset dialect poems were published in the Dorset County Chronicle (1833–34). His many books include an Anglo-Saxon primer (1849), An Outline of English Speech-Craft (1878), Poems of Rural Life in the Dorset Dialect (two series: 1844, 1862), Hwomely Rhymes (1859), and Poems of Rural Life in Common English (1868). His “Dissertation on the Dorset Dialect,” prefaced to Poems of Rural Life in 1844, is a helpful introduction to his distinctive language, though in 1859 he switched to a new way of representing it in print and revised his earlier work accordingly. Barnes combined his rustic diction with a sophisticated verse technique to powerful and distinctive effect.
