Al-Aṣmaʿī, in full Abū Saʿīd ʿAbd al-Malik ibn Qurayb al-Aṣmaʿī,  (born c. 740, Basra, Iraq—died 828, Basra), noted scholar and anthologist, one of the three leading members of the Basra school of Arabic philology.
A gifted student of Abū ʿAmr ibn al-ʿAlāʾ, the founder of the Basra school, al-Aṣmaʿī joined the court of the ʿAbbāsid caliph Hārūn al-Rashīd in Baghdad. Renowned for his piety and plain living, he was a tutor to the caliph’s sons (the future caliphs al-Amīn and al-Maʾmūn) and a favourite of the Barmakid viziers.
Al-Aṣmaʿī possessed an outstanding knowledge of the classical Arabic language. On the basis of the principles that he laid down, most of the existing divans, or collections of the pre-Islamic Arab poets, were prepared by his disciples. He also wrote an anthology, Al-Aṣmaʿīyāt, displaying a marked preference for elegiac and devotional poetry. His method and his critical concern for authentic tradition are considered remarkable for his time. Some 60 works are attributed to al-Aṣmaʿī, mainly on the animals, plants, customs, and grammatical forms in some way related to pre-Islamic Arabic poetry; of these, many are extant, generally in recensions made by his students.
