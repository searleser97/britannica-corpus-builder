Anastasius Grün, pseudonym of Anton Alexander, Count (Graf) von Auersperg,  (born April 11, 1806, Laibach, Austria [now Ljubljana, Slovenia]—died  Sept. 12, 1876, Graz), Austrian poet and statesman known for his spirited collections of political poetry.
As a member of the estates of Carniola in the Diet at Laibach, Grün was a critic of the Austrian government, and after 1848 he represented the district of Laibach briefly at the German national assembly at Frankfurt. Always an outspoken liberal reformer in both religious and political matters, he later became a staunch defender of the centralized Austrian Empire. In 1860 he was summoned to the remodeled Austrian Parliament by the emperor, who in 1861 named him a life member of the upper house (Herrenhaus).
Grün’s early works include a nondescript collection of lyrics, Blätter der Liebe (1830), followed by a significant cycle of poems, Der letzte Ritter (1830; The Last Knight), celebrating the life and adventures of the Holy Roman emperor Maximilian I. Grün’s political poetry created a sensation because of its stylistic originality, humour, and bold liberalism, far outstripping in quality other political poetry of that time. The political poems were printed in two collections: Spaziergänge eines Wiener Poeten (1831; “Promenades of a Viennese Poet”), some of which were translated in K. Francke’s German Classics of the 19th and 20th Centuries (1913); and Schutt (1836; “Rubbish”). His epics, Die Nibelungen im Frack (1843) and Der Pfaff vom Kahlenberg (1850), are characterized by a fine ironic humour. Grün also produced masterly translations of the popular Slovene songs current in Carniola in Volkslieder aus Krain (1850; “Folksongs from Carniola”) and of the English poems on Robin Hood (1864).
