Jacopone Da Todi, original name Jacopo Dei Benedetti,  (born c. 1230, Todi, duchy of Spoleto [now in Italy]—died  Dec. 25, 1306, Collazzone), Italian religious poet, author of more than 100 mystical poems of great power and originality, and probable author of the Latin poem Stabat mater dolorosa.
Born of a noble family and trained for the law, Jacopone practiced until his wife’s sudden death at a party about 1268 precipitated his total conversion to an ascetic life. He disposed of his belongings, dedicated himself to God in absolute poverty, and became (1278) a lay brother of the Franciscan order. As a member of the Spiritual faction of his order, a group espousing uncompromising poverty, Jacopone wrote violent satirical verse against Pope Boniface VIII and then signed the manifesto (1297) that declared Boniface’s election invalid. Boniface retaliated by first excommunicating and then (1298) imprisoning Jacopone for life. After Boniface died in 1303, Jacopone was released by the new pope, Benedict XI. Jacopone retired to the monastery at Collazzone, where he died three years later. His tomb is in the medieval Church of San Fortunato, Todi.
Most of Jacopone’s poetic work is in the Italian vernacular. A notable exception is the Latin Stabat mater dolorosa that has long been attributed to him. That poem was added to the Roman liturgy in the 18th century and has been set to music by many composers, including Josquin des Prez, Giovanni Palestrina, Giovanni Battista Pergolesi, Gioacchino Rossini, and Antonín Dvořák. His many laudi spirituali (“spiritual canticles”), some written during his imprisonment, are vivid and original outpourings of many moods, ranging from bitter anger to mystical ecstasy.
