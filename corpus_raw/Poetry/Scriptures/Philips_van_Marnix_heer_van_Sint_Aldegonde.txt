Philips van Marnix, Heer Van Sint Aldegonde,  (born 1540, Brussels [now in Belgium]—died  Dec. 15, 1598, Leiden, Neth.), Dutch theologian and poet whose translation of the Psalms is considered the high point of religious literature in 16th-century Holland. In exile (1568–72) and a prisoner of the Roman Catholics (1573–74), Marnix was in the thick of the political and religious struggles of the time.
His first main work was Den byencorf der H. Roomsche Kercke (1569; “The Beehive of the Roman Catholic Church”), a polemical tract in prose in which the author, affecting to defend Roman Catholicism, in fact ridicules it.
Marnix’s Psalm translations were first published in 1580, but he spent many years improving them. His constant fidelity to the original Hebrew did not inhibit his poetic nature—the language of his version is often moving and powerful. His identification with the Israelites through his own persecution and exile is strongly evident.
