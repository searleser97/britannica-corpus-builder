Eknath, also spelled Ekanatha,  (born 1544, Pratishthan [now Paithan], Maharashtra, India—died 1599, Pratishthan), poet-saint and mystic of Vaishnavism, the branch of Hinduism that reveres the deity Vishnu and his avatars (incarnations). Eknath is best known for his translations of various Sanskrit texts into Marathi (the local language of the Maharashtra region of central India), his authorship of others in that language (e.g., a vernacular version of the Ramayana), and his restored edition of the then-corrupted classic of  Marathi literature, the Jnaneshvari of the poet-saint Jnaneshvar. The object of his scholarship was to bring the means of salvation through devotion (bhakti) within the reach and understanding of ordinary people, including outcastes and women.
Although himself from the Deshastha caste of the Brahman class (see varna), Eknath came into conflict with some of the more orthodox Brahmans in his hometown over his beliefs about caste and religion. Eknath insisted that there is no distinction in God’s eyes between Brahman and outcaste or between Hindu and Muslim, and in his own life and writings he rejected such differences. Eknath’s radical form of religious egalitarianism led him not only to argue that low-caste persons are eligible for God’s grace but also to go so far as to claim in one of his compositions that “the dog and God are identical.”
Eknath was the only saint from Maharashtra to be a father and a family householder, and he was renowned for resolving the conflicts between householder duties and the demands of religious devotion through an unswerving faith in Krishna, a popular avatar of Vishnu. Paithan contains several temples dedicated to Eknath, including one at the site of his home and another near the place where he died in the Godavari River.
