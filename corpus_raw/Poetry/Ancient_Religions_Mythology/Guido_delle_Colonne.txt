Guido Delle Colonne,   (born c. 1215, Sicily?—died c. 1290, Sicily?), jurist, poet, and Latin prose writer whose poetry was praised by Dante and whose Latin version of the Troy legend was important in bringing the story to Italians and, through various translations, into English literature.
Guido delle Colonne apparently was a learned man, a judge, and the author of several Latin chronicles and histories. He was a poet of the Sicilian school, a group of early Italian vernacular poets who were associated with the courts of the Holy Roman emperor Frederick II and his son Manfred, and was strongly influenced by the poetry of France and Provence. Guido’s poetry, though slender in inspiration, was intricate in thought and excellent in form. Dante praised two of Guido’s canzoni in De vulgari eloquentia, and in the 19th century the English poet Dante Gabriel Rossetti became one of his translators.
Probably more important than Guido’s poetry, however, is his Historia destructionis Troiae (“History of the Destruction of Troy”), which he completed about 1287. Thought to be a condensed version of the French Roman de Troie by Benoît de Sainte-Maure, Guido’s work was widely translated throughout Europe. William Caxton, the first English printer, translated it from a French source and published it in Bruges about 1474 as The Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye, the first book Caxton printed and the first book printed in the English language.
