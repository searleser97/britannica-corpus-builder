Uri Zvi Greenberg, byname Tur Malka,  (born Jan. 10, 1894, Bialykamien, Eastern Galicia [now Ukraine]—died May 8, 1981, Israel), Hebrew and Yiddish poet whose strident, Expressionist verse exhorts the Jewish people to redeem their historical destiny; he warned of the impending Holocaust in such poems as “In malkhus fun tselem” (1922; “In the Kingdom of the Cross”). An adherent of the right-wing Revisionist Zionist Party, Greenberg used his poetry to espouse a religious mystical view of Zionism and to further Revisionism’s extreme nationalism.
The son of a Hasidic rabbi, Greenberg received a traditional Hasidic upbringing in Lemberg (now Lvov). In Warsaw, in 1920, he was co-publisher of Khalyastre (“The Gang”), an Expressionist, avant-garde literary journal. He wrote in both Yiddish and Hebrew until immigrating to Palestine (later Israel) in 1924; thereafter he wrote solely in Hebrew. Considered a foremost Hebrew poet of his generation, Greenberg was at odds with the main intellectual and political thrust in Hebrew literature and Israeli politics because of his political and social views. He served one term in the Knesset (parliament) as a member of the Herut Party (1949–51).
His early Hebrew-language poetry, such as “Yerushalayim shel matah” (1924; trans. as “Jerusalem”), was influenced by Walt Whitman. From the 1930s his work was politicized, as in the collection Ezor magen u-ne’um ben ha-dam (1930; “A Shield of Defense and the Word of the Son of Blood”), the poem “Migdal ha-Geviyyot” (1937; “The Tower of Corpses”), and the acclaimed collection Reḥovot hanahar (1951; “Streets of the River”).
