Kawahigashi Hekigotō, original name Kawahigashi Heigorō,  (born Feb. 26, 1873, Matsuyama, Ehime prefecture, Japan—died Feb. 1, 1937, Tokyo), Japanese poet who was a pioneer of modern haiku.
Kawahigashi and his friend Takahama Kyoshi were the leading disciples of Masaoka Shiki, a leader of the modern haiku movement. Kawahigashi became haiku editor of the magazines Hototogisu (“Cuckoo”; in 1897) and Nippon (“Japan”; in 1902), and he published two books of commentary, Haiku hyōshaku and Shoku haiku hyōshaku, in 1899. After the death of Shiki, Kawahigashi broke with Kyoshi and called for a more modern kind of haiku, one that abandoned the traditional metric pattern of 5, 7, and 5 syllables and the conventional use of “season words.” He toured Japan in 1907 and 1909–11 to promote the new poetry.
Kawahigashi published accounts of his travels in Sanzenri (“Three Thousand ri”; 1906). The haiku collection Hekigotō kushū (“Hekigotō Collection”; 1916) is also among his principal works. After his poetic abilities declined, his disciples abandoned him, and he ceased writing in 1933.
