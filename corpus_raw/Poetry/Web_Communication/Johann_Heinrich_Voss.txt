Johann Heinrich Voss,  (born February 20, 1751, Sommersdorf, Mecklenburg [Germany]—died March 29, 1826, Heidelberg, Baden), German poet remembered chiefly for his translations of Homer.
Voss was the son of a farmer. In 1772 he went to Göttingen, where he studied theology (briefly) and philology and became one of the leading spirits of the Göttinger Hain, a group of young poets. He also became editor of the Göttinger Musenalmanach. From 1778 to 1802 Voss was headmaster of schools, first at Otterndorf, Hanover, where he began to translate the Odyssey, then at Eutin; but he found the work uncongenial and became a private scholar in Jena. In 1805 he went to Heidelberg as professor of Classical philology, devoting himself to his translations. An ardent rationalist, he waged an embittered struggle against the younger Romantics and became increasingly lonely before his death.
Voss published his collected poems in 1802. As a lyricist he wrote mainly songs, odes, elegies, and pastoral idylls in the style of the ancients and of the German Neoclassical poet Friedrich Klopstock. Voss’s idyll Luise (1795), which portrays with naturalistic ease the life of a country pastor’s family, inspired Goethe to write Hermann und Dorothea.
Voss’s fame, however, rests on his translations. The Odyssey (1781) and Iliad (1793), particularly, achieved permanent importance. Voss was regarded by Goethe and other German poets as an authority on Classical metres, but his pedantic regard for the niceties of form and language made his later translations of Classical authors—such as Virgil (1789 ff.), Ovid (1798), and Horace (1806)—seem strained. He also translated The Thousand and One Nights (1781–85) and, with his sons Heinrich and Abraham, Shakespeare’s plays (1818–29).
