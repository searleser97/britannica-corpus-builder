Rose Alnora Hartwick Thorpe, née Rose Alnora Hartwick,  (born July 18, 1850, Mishawaka, Ind., U.S.—died July 19, 1939, San Diego, Calif.), American poet and writer, remembered largely for a single narrative poem that gained national popularity.
Rose Hartwick grew up in her birthplace of Mishawaka, Indiana, in Kansas, and in Litchfield, Michigan, where she graduated from public high school in 1868. From an early age she wrote poetry, much of it patterned on the sentimental verses of Lydia H. Sigourney and Felicia Hemans. Hartwick’s best-known poem, “Curfew Must Not Ring,” was inspired by a short story she read in the September 1865 issue of Peterson’s Magazine. The romantic narrative poem, written in Longfellowesque trochaic heptameters, tells how a young woman saves her true love from execution. In 1870 she submitted it to the Commercial Advertiser of Detroit, Michigan, which had published some of her earlier pieces, and from there it spread rapidly to other newspapers throughout the country. It was taken up as a favourite declamation piece and was widely anthologized and translated, but, not having taken the precaution of obtaining a copyright, she profited little from the poem’s great popularity.
In 1871 Hartwick married Edmund C. Thorpe. She continued to contribute verses to Youth’s Companion, St. Nicholas, Wide Awake, and other periodicals. Her husband’s carriage-making business failed in 1881, and in that year she became editor of and principal contributor to a series of moralistic monthlies published by Fleming H. Revell, including Temperance Tales, Words of Life, and Well-Spring. Through the remainder of her life she wrote books of verse as well as works of children’s fiction.
