Alfred Austin,  (born May 30, 1835, Leeds, Yorkshire, Eng.—died  June 2, 1913, Ashford, Kent), English poet and journalist who succeeded Alfred, Lord Tennyson, as poet laureate.
After a devoutly Roman Catholic upbringing and a brief career as a lawyer, Austin inherited money and published a lively and well-received satirical poem, The Season (1861). As his religious faith declined into agnosticism (a process described in his verse autobiography, The Door of Humility [1906]), his interest in politics grew. In 1866 he began to write for the Tory Standard and in 1883 became the founding editor of the Conservative Party’s National Review. His acerbic criticism and jingoistic verse in the 1870s led Robert Browning to dismiss him as a “Banjo-Byron,” and his appointment to the laureateship in 1896 was much mocked. He also published a series of stiff verse dramas, some novels, and a good deal of lyrical but very minor nature poetry. A patriotic poet of the most confident phase of the British Empire, his work lacked the resonance of Rudyard Kipling’s.
