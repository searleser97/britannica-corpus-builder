Etheridge Knight,  (born April 19, 1931, Corinth, Miss., U.S.—died March 10, 1991, Indianapolis, Ind.), African American poet who emerged as a robust voice of the Black Arts movement with his first volume of verse, Poems from Prison (1968). His poetry combined the energy and bravado of African American “toasts” (long narrative poems that were recited in a mixture of street slang, specialized argot, and obscenities) with a concern for freedom from oppression.
Knight grew up in Paducah, Ky., dropped out of high school, became addicted to drugs, and joined the U.S. Army, serving as a medical technician in the Korean War. Arrested for robbery in 1960, Knight was imprisoned for eight years—an experience that he recounted in verse in Poems from Prison and in prose in the anthology Black Voices from Prison (1970; originally published two years earlier in Italian as Voce negre dal carcere).
After his release from prison, Knight taught at various universities and contributed to several magazines, working for two years as an editor of Motive and as a contributing editor of New Letters (1974). He experimented with rhythmic forms of punctuation in Belly Song and Other Poems (1973), which addressed the themes of ancestry, racism, and love. In Born of a Woman (1980)—a work that balances personal suffering with affirmation—he introduced the concept of the poet as a “meddler” who forms a trinity with the poem and the reader. Much of his verse was collected in The Essential Etheridge Knight (1986).
