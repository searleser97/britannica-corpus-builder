John Lehmann, in full John Frederick Lehmann,  (born June 2, 1907, Bourne End, Buckinghamshire, Eng.—died  April 7, 1987, London), English poet, editor, publisher, and man of letters whose book-periodical New Writing and its successors were an important influence on English literature from the mid-1930s through the 1940s.
Educated at Eton and at Trinity College, Cambridge, Lehmann worked as a journalist and poet in Vienna from 1932 to 1936 and returned to England to found New Writing, which was issued under various titles until 1950. New Writing published the work of W.H. Auden, Christopher Isherwood, V.S. Pritchett, and others. Lehmann was general manager of the Hogarth Press (1938–46), founded by Leonard and Virginia Woolf, and advisory editor of The Geographical Magazine (1940–45). He and his sister, the novelist Rosamond Lehmann, directed the publishing firm of John Lehmann Ltd. (1946 to 1953). In 1954 he founded The London Magazine, a literary review that he edited until 1961.
His first volume of poems, A Garden Revisited, appeared in 1931, and several other volumes preceded his Collected Poems (1963). His autobiography, which throws much light on the literary life of his time, appeared in three volumes—The Whispering Gallery (1955), I Am My Brother (1960), and The Ample Proposition (1966)—and in a condensed one-volume version in the United States—In My Own Time (1969). Thrown to the Woolfs (1978) details his difficulties with Leonard Woolf at the Hogarth Press. Lehmann also published a biography of the poet Rupert Brooke in 1980.
