Iliya Abu Madi,  (born c. 1890, Al-Muḥaydithah, Lebanon—died  1957), Arab poet and journalist whose poetry achieved popularity through his expressive use of language, his mastery of the traditional patterns of Arabic poetry, and the relevance of his ideas to contemporary Arab readers.
When he was 11 years old, Abu Madi moved with his family from their mountain village in Lebanon to Alexandria, Egypt. As a young man, he earned money selling cigarettes. He published his first collection of poetry in Alexandria in 1911. The following year he migrated to the United States, settling in Cincinnati, where he worked with his brother. In 1916 he moved to New York City and began editing several Arabic newspapers and magazines, which were supported by New York City’s Arab community. He worked for 10 years with the magazine Mir ʾāt al-gharb (“Mirror of the West”) and married the owner’s daughter. In 1929 he started his own bimonthly magazine, Al-Samīr (“The Companion”), which he expanded into a daily newspaper in 1936 and continued to publish until his death. He spent much of his life in the United States.
Abu Madi’s first collection of poetry, Tadhkār al-māḍī (“Remembrance of the Past”), was published in Cairo in 1911. A second collection was published in New York City in 1916 and a third, Al-Dīwān al-thānī, in 1919, with an introduction by the Lebanese American poet Khalil Gibran. Al-Jadāwil (“Streams”), appeared in 1927. Al-Khamāʾil (1946; “Thickets”) was printed in Beirut, as was the posthumous Tibr wa-turāb (1960; “Ore and Dust”).
