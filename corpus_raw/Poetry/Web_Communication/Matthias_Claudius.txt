Matthias Claudius,  (born Aug. 15, 1740, Reinfeld, Holstein—died  Jan. 21, 1815, Hamburg), German poet, most notable for Der Mond ist aufgegangen (“The Moon Has Risen”) and editor of the journal Der Wandsbecker Bothe.
After studying at Jena, Claudius held a series of editorial and minor official positions in Copenhagen and Darmstadt until in 1788 he acquired a sinecure in the Schleswig-Holstein bank.  He edited the Wandsbecker Bothe (1771–75), popular not only with a general readership, for whose enlightenment it was designed, but also with the most important literary men of the time. Among the journal’s contributors were the philosopher Johann Gottfried von Herder, the poet Friedrich Klopstock, and the critic and dramatist Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, the three of whom, with Claudius, formed a circle that fought against the prevailing rationalist and Classical spirit and sought to preserve a natural and Christian atmosphere in literature. Claudius’ own poems (e.g., “Der Tod und das Mädchen”) have a naive, childlike, and devoutly Christian quality.
