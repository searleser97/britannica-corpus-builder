Geoffrey Grigson, in full Geoffrey Edward Harvey Grigson,  (born March 2, 1905, Pelynt, Cornwall, Eng.—died  Nov. 25, 1985, Broad Town, Wiltshire), English editor, poet, and literary critic who became known in the 1930s primarily as the founder-editor of the influential periodical New Verse (1933–39) and afterward as the editor and author of many poetry anthologies.
Grigson’s later career as polemical journalist, art critic, anthologist, and editor of many varied works tended to obscure his achievement as a poet—he was a miniaturist with a fine and highly individual gift for precise and delicate observation. The austerity of his early poetry was gradually replaced by more personal and emotional verse. His poetic output was brought together in Collected Poems (1963) and Collected Poems 1963–80 (1984). He also wrote an autobiography, The Crest on the Silver (1950), as well as many critical studies. Grigson was best known to the public as a literary journalist; he combined a fluent, versatile prose style with an acerbic temperament in his widely read critical articles and reviews. He also edited more than 12 anthologies of poetry, including the Oxford Book of Satirical Verse (1980).
