Conradus Celtis,  (Latin), Celtis also spelled Celtes,  German Conrad Pickel,  (born Feb. 1, 1459, Wipfeld, near Würzburg [Germany]—died  Feb. 4, 1508, Vienna, Austria), German scholar known as Der Erzhumanist (“The Archhumanist”). He was also a Latin lyric poet who stimulated interest in Germany in both classical learning and German antiquities.
Celtis studied at the universities of Cologne and Heidelberg and was crowned poet laureate by the Holy Roman emperor Frederick III at Nürnberg in 1487 (the first German to receive this honour). He spent two years in Italian humanist circles, studied mathematics and astronomy at the Jagiellonian University in Kraków, and became professor of poetry and rhetoric at the University of Ingolstadt in 1491. In 1497 Maximilian I appointed him professor at Vienna University, where Celtis founded, on Italian models, a centre for humanistic studies, the Sodalitas Danubiana.
Celtis rediscovered the manuscripts of Germany’s first woman poet, the 10th-century nun Hrosvitha, and also the so-called Peutinger Table, a map of the Roman Empire. Among his scholarly works were editions of Tacitus’ Germania (1500), Hrosvitha’s plays (1501), and the 12th-century poem on Barbarossa, Ligurinus (1507).
The dominant theme of patriotism that partly inspired these editions is an important element in Celtis’ works. German greatness past and present is a recurrent theme, as in his inaugural lecture at Ingolstadt (Oratio, 1492). In this lecture, Celtis adopted a nationalistic, anti-Italian tone and commended the study of poetry, eloquence, and philosophy as a foundation for personal and political virtue. Celtis’ masques with music, Ludus Dianae (1501) and Rhapsodia (1505), were early forerunners of Baroque opera. His greatest work, however, is his lyric poetry—Odes (published posthumously, 1513), Epigrams (in manuscript until 1881), and especially Amores (1502), love poems of forthright sensuality and true lyrical intensity.
