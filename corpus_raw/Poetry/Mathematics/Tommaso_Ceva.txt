Tommaso Ceva,  (born December 20, 1648, Milan [Italy]—died February 3, 1737, Milan), Jesuit mathematician and poet, who was the younger brother of Giovanni Ceva.
In 1663 Tommaso Ceva entered the Society of Jesus at the Brera College in Milan and soon became a professor of rhetoric and mathematics, teaching at Brera for more than 40 years. Ceva’s only mathematical work is Opuscula mathematica (1699; “Mathematical Essays”), which collects his papers on physics, arithmetic, and geometry. Ceva’s “scientific” work, De natura gravium (1699; “The Nature of Gravity”), deals with gravity from a philosophical and theological perspective.
Ceva’s fame derives primarily from his Latin verses. In particular, his religious poem Jesus Puer (1690; “Child Jesus”) was widely reprinted and translated into German, French, and Italian. Two other collections of Latin verses, Sylvae (1699; “Woods”) and Carmina (1704; “Poems”), range over philosophic, scientific, religious, and literary subjects.
