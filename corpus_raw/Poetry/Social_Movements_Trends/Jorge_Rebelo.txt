Jorge Rebelo,  (born 1940, Lourenço Marques, Portuguese East Africa), African poet, lawyer, and journalist.
Rebelo studied at the University of Coimbra in Portugal, was secretary for information for the Mozambican anti-Portuguese guerrilla group Frelimo, and edited the magazine Mozambique Revolution. Though José Craveirinha is called the “poet of Mozambique,” Rebelo is known as the “poet of the Mozambican revolution.”
Rebelo’s poetry is didactic and single purposed: he is a poet of and for the Mozambican freedom fighters. Indeed, Rebelo’s poetry can be seen as a chronicle of the fight for Mozambican independence, a call to arms, and a rationale for the bloodshed and hardships of war.
As praise singer, more specifically a guerrilla poet in praise of a just war, Rebelo soothes, exhorts, and rallies his comrades. His poetry is included in such selected anthologies as Mario de Andrade’s Literatura Africana de Expressao Portuguesa (1967) and Margaret Dickinson’s When Bullets Begin to Flower (1972).
