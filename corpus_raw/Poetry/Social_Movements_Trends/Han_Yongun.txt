Han Yongun, also called Manhae,  (born 1879, Korea—died 1944, Korea), Korean Buddhist poet and religious and political leader.
Han participated in the famous Tonghak Revolt of 1894, a social reform movement directed by leaders of the apocalyptic Tonghak sect. With the failure of the movement, Han escaped to Mount Solok, where he began to study Buddhism, entering the priesthood in 1905. He immediately became a leader of the struggle to renovate and nationalize Korean Buddhism; in 1909 he published the influential Pulgyo-yusin-ron. In 1910, when Korea fell under Japanese rule, he joined the independence movement, convening a nationwide meeting of Buddhists to call for Korea’s independence and the independence of Korean Buddhism from the Japanese. He took part in the drafting and signing of a Korean Declaration of Independence in 1919, and he was arrested and imprisoned for three years.
In 1927 he led in the establishment of the Singanhoe society, a united national independence front. He also continued to work toward the modernization and popularization of Buddhism. Han published poems, many inspired by the Gandhian civil-disobedience movement, a collection of which, Nim ŭi ch’immuk (“The Silence of the Lover”), is regarded as a classic of modern Korean literature. The “Lover” in the title and throughout the work is at once the Buddha and his fatherland.
