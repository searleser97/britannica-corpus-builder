Samuel Bamford,  (born Feb. 28, 1788, Middleton, Lancashire, Eng.—died  April 13, 1872, Harpurhey, Lancashire), English radical reformer who was the author of several widely popular poems (principally in the Lancashire dialect) showing sympathy with the condition of the working class. He became a working weaver and earned great respect in northern radical circles as a reformer.
Bamford formed a Hampden Club in Middleton in 1817 and met William Cobbett, Henry Hunt, William Benbow, and Sir Francis Burdett. In 1819 he was arrested as a result of attending and speaking at the Manchester meeting known as Peterloo and was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment. Bamford became a journalist in London in about 1826. He continued to press for the reform of working-class conditions, on which his Passages in the Life of a Radical (1840–44) and Early Days (1849) are illuminating. On his death he was accorded a public funeral that was attended by thousands.
