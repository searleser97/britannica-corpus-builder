Nanticoke,  a confederacy of Algonquian-speaking North American Indians who lived along the eastern shores of what are now Maryland and southern Delaware; their name means “tidewater people.” They were related to the Delaware and the Conoy. Nanticoke subsistence depended largely on fishing and trapping, and their social organization probably included a head chief, as well as subordinate chiefs of the various tribes. They were at war with the Maryland colonists from 1642 to 1678; in 1698 reservations were set aside for them. Sometime after 1722 most of the Nanticoke began moving northward, some settling with the Iroquois in what is now western New York state; many emigrated westward about 1784 and were incorporated into the Delaware tribe in what have become Ohio and Indiana.
Early 21st-century population estimates indicated approximately 2,500 individuals of Nanticoke descent.
