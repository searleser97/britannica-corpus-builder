Amuzgo, also spelled Amusgo,  ethnolinguistic Indian group of eastern Guerrero and western Oaxaca states, southern Mexico. Their language is related to that of the Mixtec, their neighbours to the north and west. Although many Amuzgo can speak Spanish, the majority (about 65 percent) speak only Amuzgo.
The people are agricultural, using the plow or digging stick to plant staples of corn, beans, and squash, as well as some chilies and tomatoes, and sugarcane as a cash crop. Wild game and seafood are eaten, and farm animals are also kept. Houses are traditionally round thatched huts, two or more for each household. Settlements may be in towns or villages or dispersed. Weaving and pottery are the major crafts practiced, though hammocks, ropes, and nets are also made.
The compadrazgo, or godparent relationship, is widely practiced, godparents being chosen at baptism and marriage. Children owe great respect to godparents, and parents and godparents participate in various rituals of kinship. Nominally Roman Catholic, the Amuzgo celebrate their community’s patron saint’s day and practice baptism and marriage in the church; however, several non-Christian rituals are also observed, and the mythology of the community is non-Christian.
