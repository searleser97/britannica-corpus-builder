Palta,   Ecuadorian Indian ethnolinguistic group that lived in the Andean highlands at the time of the Spanish conquest (16th century). Although the Ecuadorian highlands are still inhabited by persons of Indian descent, the languages, cultures, and tribal affiliations existing at the time of the conquest have disappeared and little is known of them. The Palta language probably belonged to the Arawakan language family. The Palta appear to have moved into the highlands from the tropical forests to the east not long before the conquest. They were mainly farmers who grew corn (maize), potatoes, beans, squash, avocados, and tropical fruits. Settlements were dispersed, each family living on its own farmland; houses were made of mud and thatch. Little is known about Palta crafts, religion, or social structure.
