Mimbres,   a prehistoric North American people who formed a branch of the classic Mogollon culture and who lived principally along the Mimbres River in the rugged Gila Mountains of what is present-day southwestern New Mexico, U.S. They also lived along nearby stretches of the Gila River and the Rio Grande. At the height of their culture, between ad 1000 and 1150 (known as the Classic Mimbres Period), the Mimbres lived in compact pueblolike villages of adobe and masonry, each village containing perhaps 200 people. Because of sparse rainfall in the area, they relied on irrigation to grow corn (maize), beans, and squash; they also hunted small game. The Mimbres are perhaps most famous for their pottery, which was decorated with imaginative black-on-white designs of insects, animals, and birds or of geometric lines.
The Mimbres, numbering perhaps 5,000 at their height, were eventually absorbed by the closely related Pueblo peoples to the north. Some may have migrated to Mexico.
