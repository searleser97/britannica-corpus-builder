Achagua,   South American Indian people of Venezuela and eastern Colombia. They speak a language of the Maipurean Arawakan group. Traditionally, the Achagua had typical tropical-forest economies, living in large villages and growing bitter cassava and other crops. The Achagua were warlike; they were one of the few native South American people to use arrows poisoned with curare.
Achagua social organization was distinguished by numerous lineages named for animals such as the serpent, bat, jaguar, and fox. Each such unit occupied one communal house in the village. The Achagua were polygynous, each man aiming to have three or four wives. The chiefs also maintained concubines. The wives were legally equal, and each cultivated her own separate field. Women were excluded from the menâ€™s house and from a number of religious ceremonies. The Achagua believed in a supreme being, in a god of the fields, a god of riches, and gods of earthquakes, of madness, and of fire. They also worshipped lakes.
