Miami,  Algonquian-speaking North American Indians who lived in the area of what is now Green Bay, Wis., U.S., when first encountered by French explorers in the 17th century. The Miami also lived in established settlements at the southern end of Lake Michigan in what are now northeastern Illinois and northern Indiana and on the Kalamazoo River in what is now Michigan; they continued to expand as far as Detroit and Ohio but later withdrew from their eastern territories and settled in Indiana.
Miami social organization was based on exogamous, or out-marrying, clans. Because it mandates marriage between, rather than within, extended family groups, this form of kinship fostered strongly interconnected communities. Clan chiefs served as members of the village council; one of their number was elected civil chief. A separate war chief was chosen on the basis of ability in leading raids. At the time of the first French contact, the Miami were divided into six bands, of which two, the Wea and the Piankashaw, later became separate tribes.
The staple of the traditional Miami diet was a particular type of corn (maize) that they considered superior to that cultivated by their neighbours. During the summer the Miami occupied permanent agricultural villages; in the winter they moved to the prairies for communal bison hunts. In addition to mat-covered dwellings, each village had a large building in which councils and ceremonies were held. A major feature of Miami religion was the Midewiwin, or Grand Medicine Society, a religious organization whose members were believed to be able to cure the sick and secure supernatural aid for tribal welfare. Sacred medicine bundles of magical objects were important in many Miami rites and ceremonies.
In the 19th century the Miami ceded most of their lands to the United States,  and many moved to a reservation in Indian Territory (Oklahoma) in 1867.
Population estimates indicated approximately 6,500 Miami descendants in the early 21st century.
