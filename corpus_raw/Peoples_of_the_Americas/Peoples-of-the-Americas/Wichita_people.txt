Wichita, self-name Kitikiti’sh,  North American Indian people of Caddoan linguistic stock who originally lived near the Arkansas River in what is now the state of Kansas. They were encountered by the Spanish in the mid-16th century and became the first group of Plains Indians subject to missionization.
Like most Caddoans, the Wichita traditionally subsisted largely by farming corn (maize), pumpkins, and tobacco; buffalo hunting was also an important part of their economy. They lived in communal grass-thatched lodges the shape of domed haystacks. On hunting expeditions they resided in tepees. Wichita men wore a scalp lock (a long lock of hair on the top of the head) and sometimes a porcupine roach, a head ornament made of such materials as porcupine guard hair and hair from the tail of a deer. More given to tattooing than most Plains Indians, they were known by other groups as the “tattooed people.” Their name for themselves, Kitikiti’sh, means “raccoon eyes,” a reference to a distinctive tattoo around the eyes. They performed a ceremonial dance resembling the Green Corn festivals of the southeastern tribes.
In the late 18th century the Wichita moved south, probably under pressure from tribes to the northeast that were encroaching on Wichita territory. By 1772 they were located near what is now Wichita Falls, Texas. During the American Civil War they returned to Kansas, and in 1867 they were removed to the Wichita Indian Reservation in Oklahoma, designated for the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes (Waco, Keechi [Kichai], and Tawakonie [Tawakoni]). Their estimated population in 1780 was 3,200; Wichita descendants numbered more than 1,900 in the early 21st century.
