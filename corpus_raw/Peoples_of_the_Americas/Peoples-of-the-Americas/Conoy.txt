Conoy, also called Piscataway,  an Algonquian-speaking North American Indian tribe related to the Delaware and the Nanticoke; before colonization by the English, they lived between the Potomac River and the western shore of Chesapeake Bay in what is now Maryland. Early accounts suggest that their economy was based mainly on hunting the abundant game and fowl of the area, using bows and arrows and spears, and that they lived in oval-shaped dwellings.
Harassed by the Susquehannock (Susquehanna) in the 17th century, the rapidly decreasing Conoy retreated up the Potomac and into Pennsylvania. They gradually migrated up the Susquehanna River, and by 1765 the 150 members of the tribe, dependent on the Iroquois, had reached southern New York. They moved west with the Mohican and the Delaware, becoming part of these tribes.
