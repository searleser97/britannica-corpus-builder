Mayo,   Indian people centred in southern Sonora and northern Sinaloa states on the west coast of Mexico. They speak a dialect of the Cahita language, which belongs to the Uto-Aztecan language family.
The history of the Mayo people prior to the Spanish conquest of Mexico is obscure. In the early 17th century they readily allied themselves with the Spaniards against their northern neighbours, the Yaqui. But gradual Spanish encroachment on their land drove the Mayo to revolt in 1740 and subsequently before they were permanently pacified in the 1880s by Mexicoâ€™s central government.
The Mayo are concentrated in the fertile irrigated valleys of the Mayo and Fuerte rivers, which are set in the midst of semidesert terrain that supports thorny scrubland and cactus. The Mayo are settled agriculturalists whose traditional crops of corn (maize), beans, and squash have given way in part to such crops as cotton, wheat, and safflower (for oil). The Mayo combine Roman Catholicism with aboriginal religious practices. They numbered about 80,000 in the late 20th century.
