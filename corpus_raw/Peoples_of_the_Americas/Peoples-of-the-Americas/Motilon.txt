Motilón,  (Spanish: “Hairless Ones”), collective name loosely applied by the Spaniards to various highland and lowland American Indian peoples who lived in and about the Colombian and Venezuelan Andes and Lake Maracaibo. Chief among them were the Chaké and the Mape, who were agricultural and forest-dwelling and hostilely resisted European encroachments well into the 20th century.
