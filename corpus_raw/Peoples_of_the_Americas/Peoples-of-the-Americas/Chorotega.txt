Chorotega,   the most powerful American Indian tribe of northwest Costa Rica at the time of the Spanish conquest. They spoke Mangue, a language of Oto-Manguean stock, and had probably migrated from a homeland in Chiapas many generations prior to the conquest, driving the aboriginal inhabitants out of their new territory.
The Chorotega were corn farmers, had markets and a semidemocratic social structure in which chiefs were elected, and carried on frequent warfare with neighbouring peoples. They wore padded cotton armour and fought with bow and arrow and a wooden sword set with small flint knives. Religious festivals featured the South American custom of the ritual drinking bout; however, Mexican traits such as human sacrifice and self-mutilation of the ears, tongue, and genitals were also present. A pantheon of gods was worshiped in specially constructed temples. Chorotegan culture and language disappeared during the colonial period.
