Xavante, also spelled Shavante,  Brazilian Indian group speaking Xavante, a language of the Macro-Ge language family. The Xavante, who numbered about 10,000 in the early 21st century, live in the southeastern corner of Mato Grosso state, between the Rio das Mortes and the Araguaia River, in a region of upland savannah laced with narrow bands of forest running alongside the rivers. The Xavante and the closely related Xer√©nte (q.v.) at one time lived along the Tocantins River in Goias state, but pressure from Brazilian settlers in the 1840s caused the Xavante to move to their present home.
The Xavante successfully defended their new territory against outsiders and lived in relative isolation until the 1930s, when they gained sudden notoriety in the wake of their fierce resistance to the new wave of settlers and government agents who were trying to bring central Brazil into the mainstream of Brazilian culture and economy.
Traditionally, the Xavante were nomadic hunters and gatherers who lived in temporary horseshoe-shaped villages on the savannah and cultivated corn (maize), beans, and pumpkins on seasonally visited garden plots. They hunted tapir, deer, wild pigs, and birds and gathered roots, nuts, and honey.
