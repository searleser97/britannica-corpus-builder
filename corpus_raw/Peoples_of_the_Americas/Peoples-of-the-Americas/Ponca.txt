Ponca,  North American Indians of the Dhegiha branch of the Siouan language family. The Ponca were never a large tribe; an early estimate places their number at 800 individuals. Perhaps because of their small population, they have moved frequently over the past several centuries. Their original locale is thought to have been in what is now the U.S. state of Virginia, from which they moved in turn to the present states of North and South Carolina, western Missouri, and Minnesota. They left Minnesota in the late 17th century owing to incursions by the Dakota Sioux.
The Ponca eventually established homes in what are now southwestern Minnesota and the Black Hills of South Dakota. Like many other Plains Indians, they resided in semipermanent agricultural villages and lived in earth lodges. During the spring and autumn hunting seasons they engaged in communal bison hunts and camped in tepees.
By 1804, when they were encountered by Lewis and Clark, a smallpox epidemic had reduced the tribe to about 200 individuals. In 1865 the Ponca were guaranteed a reservation on their homelands, but after bureaucratic blundering the land was awarded to the Dakota, and the Ponca were forcibly removed to Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma). The tribe found living conditions there unbearable; led by Chief Standing Bear, they traveled north on foot for 600 miles (965 km) to eastern Nebraska, where they received asylum from the Omaha. Many Ponca were arrested for leaving their assigned territory but were freed after a young Omaha woman named Susette La Flesche convinced a group of wealthy and sympathetic individuals to defend the Ponca cause in court. The tribe later moved back to Oklahoma.
In the early 21st century Ponca descendants numbered approximately 5,000 individuals.
