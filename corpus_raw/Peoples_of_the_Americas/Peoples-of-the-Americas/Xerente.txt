Xerénte, also spelled Sherente,  Brazilian Indian group speaking Xerénte, a Macro-Ge language. The Xerénte live in northern Goias state, on a hilly upland plateau that is broken up by strips of forest that trace the courses of the rivers flowing through the region. They numbered approximately 500 in the late 20th century.
The Xerénte and the closely related Xavante (q.v.) at one time lived as neighbours along the Tocantins River in Goias state; the earliest travelers through the area failed to distinguish the two groups, ethnically or linguistically. By the 1840s, however, newcomers settling along the Tocantins River had pushed the Xerénte and Xavante away from the river; the Xerénte moved northeast, to their present home between the Tocantins River and the Sono River.
The Xerénte, unlike the Xavante, interacted with the missionaries and other early settlers; some learned Portuguese, some became Christians, and most became knowledgeable about mainstream Brazilian culture. In the second half of the 20th century, the Xerénte were an “integrated” group, participating so fully in the Brazilian society and economy that they are no longer considered to have a distinct tribal identity.
