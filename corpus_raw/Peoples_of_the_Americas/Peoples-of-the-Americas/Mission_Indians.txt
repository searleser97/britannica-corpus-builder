Mission Indians,  North American Indians of what is now the southern and central California coast, among whom Spanish Franciscans and soldiers established 21 missions between 1769 and 1823. The major groups were, from south to north, the Diegueño, Luiseño and Juaneño, Gabrielino, Chumash, and Costanoan.
The Franciscans were given two goals by the Spanish crown: to spread Roman Catholicism and to create a docile taxpaying citizenry for New Spain. However, beyond some instruction in the Spanish language, Christian dogma, and hymn singing, the tribes received little formal education. They were put to work tending mission farms, livestock, and facilities and discouraged—in some cases prohibited—from leaving their home mission. Many were converted; many died of European diseases to which they had no immunity; and many became dependent upon the missions for subsistence and shelter.
When the authority of the missions was officially ended by the Mexican government in 1834, many of the tribes were left adrift. By law they were promised the rights of citizenship and one-half of all former mission property, but many were exploited and despoiled by speculators; others successfully assimilated into the Mexican system. In the 20th century some Mission tribes became relatively wealthy through the sale and lease of their landholdings in resort areas such as Palm Springs, Calif.
Population estimates indicated more than 25,000 individuals of Mission Indian descent in the early 21st century.
