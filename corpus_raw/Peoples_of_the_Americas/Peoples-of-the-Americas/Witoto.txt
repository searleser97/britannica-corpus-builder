Witoto, also spelled Huitoto,  South American Indians of southeastern Colombia and northern Peru, belonging to an isolated language group. There were more than 31 Witotoan tribes in an aboriginal population of several thousand. Exploitation, disease, and assimilation had reduced the Witoto to fewer than 1,000 individuals at the latest estimate. The greatest decline occurred during their exploitation as rubber gatherers at the turn of the 20th century. The most important surviving groups were the Witoto proper, the Bora (Miranna), the Ocaina, and the Orejone, now living along the Putumayo, Apaporis, and Caquet√° rivers.
Witoto culture is typical of the tropical forest: they are good farmers and food gatherers as well as proficient hunters and fishermen. The typical settlement consists of a single large round or rectangular hut sheltering many families. They use large, hollow signal drums. Traditionally, women go naked, while men wear only a breechclout; both sexes paint colourful designs on their bodies (sometimes from shoulders to ankles).
Warfare was common among the Witoto, who kept young prisoners but ate older captives. Cannibalism was limited to male participation and was part of a magico-religious celebration. Shamans conjured spirits and healed diseases. Child betrothal and bride service were present. The Witoto household, consisting of the head, his sons, their wives, and unmarried children, was the basic political unit.
