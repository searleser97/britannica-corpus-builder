Tucuna, also spelled Ticuna, or Tikuna,  a South American Indian people living in Brazil, Peru, and Colombia, around the Amazon-Solimões and Putomayo-Içá rivers. They numbered about 25,000 in the late 1980s. The Tucunan language does not appear to be related to any of the other languages spoken in the region.
The Tucuna live in flat, moist, jungle tracts in the northwest Amazon basin and cultivate bitter and sweet cassava, yams, and corn (maize). They raise chickens for food and keep a number of wild mammals as pets around their houses. The Tucuna gather tubers and nuts from the forest and eat some types of frogs, certain larvae, and ants. They collect wild honey but do not keep bees. At one time, the Tucuna were skilled hunters, using bows and arrows, spears, blowguns, snares, and traps. In the 20th century, however, the demand for animal hides has depleted the availability of game in the jungle and has altered old patterns of hunting.
The Tucuna manufacture a simple type of pottery but do not weave cloth or practice metallurgy. They are accomplished in the art of making and using bark cloth, out of which they make ceremonial masks and large animal figures. They manufacture many different baskets and other containers out of a variety of plant fibres.
The 20th-century Tucuna are adaptable and successful traders, just as their forebears had been. Traditionally, the Tucuna exchanged certain vegetable poisons of the Amazonian forest for goods brought down from the mountains. In recent years, the Tucuna have provided animal hides and canoes to urbanized South Americans, in exchange for money and manufactured goods.
