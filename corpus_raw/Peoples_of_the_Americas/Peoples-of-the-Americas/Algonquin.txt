Algonquin,  North American Indian tribe of closely related Algonquian-speaking bands originally living in the dense forest regions of the valley of the Ottawa River and its tributaries in present-day Quebec and Ontario, Canada. The tribe should be differentiated from the Algonquian language family, as the latter term refers to a much larger entity composed of at least 24 tribes of Northeast Indians and Plains Indians.
Traditionally, Algonquin people shared many cultural traits with the tribes flanking them on the east, the Innu, and with the Ojibwa to the west. Before colonization by the French, Dutch, and English, the Algonquin were probably organized in bands of patrilineal extended families. Each band resided in a semipermanent longhouse village during the summer, tending gardens of corn (maize), fishing, and collecting wild plant foods. During the winter, bands dispersed across the landscape to hunt terrestrial mammals. In the spring, some Algonquin bands tapped maple trees to make syrup. Military activities, particularly skirmishes with warriors from the Iroquois Confederacy, occurred throughout the year.
During colonization, the Algonquin became heavily involved in the fur trade. As the first tribe upriver from Montreal, they had a strategic market advantage as fur trade intermediaries; in addition to trading pelts they obtained directly from the hunt, the Algonquin traded corn and furs from tribes in the North American interior for French manufactured goods.
Algonquin descendants numbered more than 5,000 in the early 21st century.
