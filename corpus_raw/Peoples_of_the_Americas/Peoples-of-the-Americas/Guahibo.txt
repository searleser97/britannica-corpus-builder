Guahibo and Chiricoa,   two South American Indian groups inhabiting the savannas along the Orinoco River in eastern Colombia; some Guahibo also live east of the Orinoco in Venezuela. They speak closely related languages or dialects of Guahiboan and are otherwise culturally indistinguishable.
Traditionally, the Guahibo and Chiricoa were nomadic hunters, gatherers, and fishermen; their most important food animal was the armadillo. Constantly on the move, they rarely spent more than two or three days in one camp. Their largest unit of organization was the band, under a hereditary leader. They were estimated to number about 20,000 in the late 20th century.
Throughout the historic period there has been a fairly extensive trade between the nomads of the savanna and the sedentary farming peoples in the forests to the south. At one time the nomads supplied them with slaves captured in their warfare with other tribes. They had a rather complex technology for a nomadic people and made painted pottery, hammocks, and many kinds of baskets.
