Chono,   extinct South American Indian group that lived in southern Chile, between the Corcovado Gulf and the Gulf of Penas. At no time represented by more than a few hundred individuals, the Chono have never been thoroughly described by linguists or ethnographers. The linguistic affiliation of the Chono language is unknown. The last surviving family of Chono was reported in 1875, after which it appears that the entire Chono tribe died out or was absorbed into the populations of other Fuegian peoples. 
The Chono lived a nomadic life along the seacoast, hunting birds and seals, fishing, gathering eggs and shellfish, and utilizing the occasional beached whale. Women customarily dove for shellfish; men captured fish in bark-fibre nets, as well as seals in nets of rawhide. The only domesticated animal kept by the Chono in pre-Spanish times was a small, long-haired, shaggy dog. The Chono dogs were trained to help in hunting and fishing, and their shaggy hair provided fibre that was combined with bark and other vegetable fibres and woven into clothing and mats. The Chono did not practice agriculture, except for the cultivation of potatoes and other vegetables in small garden plots, in pre-Spanish times. In the post-Columbian years, the Chono grew some corn (maize) and barley and kept a few sheep and goats.
