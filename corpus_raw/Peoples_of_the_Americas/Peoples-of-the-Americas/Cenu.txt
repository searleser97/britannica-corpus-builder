Cenú,   Indians of the northern lowlands of Colombia who became extinct under Spanish rule. The Cenú were a tropical-forest people who spoke a Cariban language. They were agriculturists, and their chief crops were probably corn (maize), sweet manioc (yuca), and sweet potatoes; cotton was raised for its fibres. Hunting, fishing, and gathering wild foods were also important.
Their settlements consisted of large villages protected by stockades, the houses being built of poles and thatch and sometimes plastered with mud. Their crafts included cotton weaving, pottery, the making of hammocks and dugout canoes, and the working of gold. Clothing, because of the hot climate, was minimal; men probably wore only genital coverings or ornaments, while women wore wraparound skirts of cotton cloth. Gold ornaments of all types were common.
The Cenú were ruled by chiefs, including a woman chief. Polygamy was common, and cannibalism was practiced. Their religion centred on idols housed in large temples.
