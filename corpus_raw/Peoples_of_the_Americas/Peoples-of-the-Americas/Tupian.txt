Tupian,   South American Indians who speak languages of the Tupian linguistic group. Tupian-speaking peoples were widespread south of the Amazon. The similarity between dialects suggests that their scattering was fairly recent. Aboriginal Tupian speakers were found from the mouth of the Amazon to the Río de la Plata, both along the Atlantic coast and in the interior.
The Tupians were tropical rain forest farmers, rivermen, and coastal navigators. Using slash-and-burn cultivation, they grew cassava, sweet potatoes, corn (maize), beans, peanuts (groundnuts), cotton, and dyes. They collected turtles and turtle eggs and caught fish and river mammals with arrows and harpoons from large dugout canoes. They also used vegetable drugs for fishing. The hunting of wild game was secondary.
The basic unit of Tupian society was the extended family (including parents, married children, and their families), occupying a single large thatched house, but some Tupians had patrilineal clans. On the lower Amazon and the coast, palisaded multi-house villages of several thousand persons occurred. These villages warred incessantly, capturing, torturing, and eating their victims. Religion was largely shamanistic with little village ceremonialism. See also Guaraní; Sirionó; Tupinambá; Kawaíb.
