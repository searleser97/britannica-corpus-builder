Puelche, also called Guennakin,  extinct South American Indian tribe that inhabited the grassy Pampas in the vicinity of the Río Negro and Río Colorado and ranged north as far as the Río de la Plata. The Puelche had their own language but in social and economic characteristics resembled their Patagonian and Pampean neighbours, especially the Tehuelche.
Little is known of the Puelche prior to the introduction of the horse in the early 18th century. The horse was used not only for transportation but also as a staple food, and its introduction caused radical changes in their social organization, giving rise to intersocietal hostilities, political leadership changes, and other new problems. The Puelche moved in mounted bands numbering 100 to 120 persons, carrying their skin-covered shelters with them. They fought with lances and bolas and wore hide coats and helmets to protect themselves.
