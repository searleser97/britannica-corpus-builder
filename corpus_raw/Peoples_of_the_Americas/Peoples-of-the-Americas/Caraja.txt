Carajá, also spelled Karajá,  tribe of South American Indians living along the Araguaia River, near the inland island of Bananal, in central Brazil. Their language may be distantly related to Ge, which is spoken by most of the surrounding tribes. The three subtribes of the Carajá—the Carajá proper, the Shambioá, and the Javahé—have almost identical cultures and are all oriented toward the river rather than toward the forest. The principal source of food is fish, with agricultural produce of almost equal importance. Clearings are made in the jungle flanking the river and planted with cassava, corn (maize), and a variety of other crops. The Carajá wear little clothing but use a variety of ornaments. Men wear labrets in the lower lip, as well as earplugs, while both sexes use a great deal of body paint and tattoo a small circle on each cheek as a tribal mark.
In the wet season large, permanent thatched houses are occupied by the members of several related families; during the dry season flimsy shelters are built on the sandy beaches along the river. Within the village the social unit is the extended family, and the heads of these families are the effective leaders of the society. The village chief, although granted considerable deference, has little authority. For most purposes the villages are independent of one another, but some adjoining villages cooperate in religious ceremonies.
The Carajá are noted for the singing and dancing that are prominent features of all ceremonies. The religion is dominated by the men, who hold masked dances during which they impersonate spirits and the ghosts of slain enemies.
