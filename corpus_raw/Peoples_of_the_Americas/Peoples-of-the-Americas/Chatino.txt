Chatino,  Mesoamerican Indians of southwestern Oaxaca state in southern Mexico. The Chatino language is closely related to the neighbouring Zapotec language, and there are many cultural similarities between the two groups. The Chatino live in a mountainous region. They are agricultural, raising a staple crop of corn (maize), as well as beans, squash, tomatoes, and chilies. Eggs and chickens are the major source of protein in the diet. Families usually prefer to live in villages, and outlying farm families may settle together in small hamlets rather than live alone on their land. The production of cash crops such as coffee has resulted in abandonment of many native crafts. Pottery and major weaving are rare, although weaving of belts and basketmaking are still done to some extent. Houses are made of  poles and thatch or adobe and tile. Clothing combines traditional styles with machine-made cloth: white cotton for men, long skirts and blouses for women. Early 21st-century estimates of Chatino population range from approximately 22,000 to 49,000.
