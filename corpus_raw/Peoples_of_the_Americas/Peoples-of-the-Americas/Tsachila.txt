Tsáchila, Chibchan Tsatchela, also called Colorado,  Indian people of the Pacific coast of Ecuador. They live in the tropical lowlands of the northwest, where, along with the neighbouring Chachi, they are the last remaining aboriginal group. The Tsáchila are linguistically related to the Chachi, although their Chibchan languages are mutually unintelligible.
The Tsáchila are fishermen and slash-and-burn agriculturists. Their staple crop is plantain, but cassava (manioc), yams, cacao, peppers, corn (maize), rice, and other crops are also grown. They also hunt and keep some domestic animals. Fishing often is undertaken with the use of poisons extracted from forest plants. Game hunters originally relied on blowguns firing clay pellets, but these have been largely replaced by shotguns. From the mid-20th century, the Tsáchila ways of life underwent further drastic changes, as many were induced to work on the plantations of local colonists and in urban areas.
Some 2,000 Tsáchila were left in the late 20th century. Those who remain in the forest live scattered in single-family houses, consisting usually of thatched roofs supported by posts and lacking walls. Men traditionally wear a knee-length wraparound kilt and a square of cotton cloth over the shoulders; women wear an ankle-length wraparound cotton skirt and a shawl tied at the neck. Their religious practices are a mixture of shamanism and Roman Catholicism.
The Tsáchila were so named because of their use of red pigment. Men covered their entire bodies with red pigment, while women painted only their faces. Their hair was also treated with red dye and sculpted to look helmetlike.
