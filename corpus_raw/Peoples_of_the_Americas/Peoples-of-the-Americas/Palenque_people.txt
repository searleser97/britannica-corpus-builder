Palenque, also called Guarine,  Indian tribe of northern Venezuela at the time of the Spanish conquest (16th century). The Palenque were closely related to the neighbouring Cumanagoto (q.v.); their language probably belonged to the Arawakan family. They were a tropical-forest people known to eat human flesh, to be warlike, and to live in settlements surrounded by palisades (palenques). The Pat√°ngoro (q.v.) of Colombia were also sometimes called Palenque because of their fortified settlements.
