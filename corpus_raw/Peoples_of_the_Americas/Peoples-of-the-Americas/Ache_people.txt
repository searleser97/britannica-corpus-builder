Aché, also called Guayakí,   nomadic South American Indian people living in eastern Paraguay. The Aché speak a Tupian dialect of the Tupi-Guaranian language family. They live in the densely forested, hilly region between the Paraguay and Paraná rivers. In pre-Spanish times, the Aché lived a more settled, agricultural life in a less harsh environment, but the activities of the Spanish and of the other tribes in the area pushed them into the hill country. The Aché probably numbered fewer than 1,000 individuals in the late 20th century. 
During and after the Spanish period, the Aché lived in bands of about 20 people, moving daily in search of forest game, which they hunted with bows and arrows, spears, traps, and pits. They fished in the rivers with bows and arrows, dams, and nets and harvested wild fruits and other plants, as well as grubs. 
Always an elusive people, the Aché were poorly known until the latter half of the 20th century, when the Paraguayan government’s pacification program encouraged them to settle in permanent villages or camps. It was not until this time that social scientists were able to investigate and confirm scattered but persistent reports that some Aché groups had practiced cannibalism well into the second half of the 20th century.
