Luiseño, also called Juaneño,  North American Indians who spoke a Uto-Aztecan language and inhabited a region extending from what is now Los Angeles to San Diego, Calif., U.S. Some of the group were named Luiseño after the Mission San Luis Rey de Francia; others were called Juaneño because of their association with the Mission San Juan Capistrano. Early ethnographers classified the two into separate cultures, but they are now regarded as one group.
Although some Luiseño lived on the Pacific coast, where they fished and gathered mollusks, the great majority lived in the inland hills and valleys. As with many other California Indians, they subsisted on acorns, seeds, fruits, and roots as well as game hunted with bows and arrows or snares. In the warm climate the men wore nothing, and the women wore an apron front and back.
Luiseño people lived in villages of semisubterranean earth-covered lodges and were apparently organized in small kin-based groups clustered into clans or quasi-clans; these had territorial, political, and economic functions. Everyone belonged to religious societies, which had both ceremonial and political functions. Several family groupings had chiefs, and in most areas there was apparently a chief of chiefs.
The Luiseño were mystics, and their conception of a great, all-powerful, avenging god was uncommon for aboriginal North America. In deference to this god, Chingichnish, they held a series of initiation ceremonies for boys, some of which involved a drug made from jimsonweed (Datura stramonium). This was drunk to inspire visions or dreams of the supernatural, which were central to the Luiseño religion. Equally important were mourning ceremonies, a series of funerary observances and anniversary commemorations of the dead. Shamanism and medicine men were important in curing disease.
Population estimates indicated approximately 9,000 Juaneño and Luiseño descendants in the early 21st century.
