Tanana,  Athabaskan-speaking North American Indian group that lived along the headwaters of the Tanana River in what is now central Alaska. Traditionally, they were nomadic hunters, relying chiefly on caribou, moose, and mountain sheep for food and clothing. They lived in skin-covered domed lodges in winter and in bark or brush lean-tos or huts in summer. They were organized into several loosely led matrilineal clans and used the potlatch to distribute material wealth throughout the group and to increase personal prestige. Although the central person in Tanana religious life was the shaman, the religion was highly individualized; each person developed his own beliefs, practices, amulets, and taboos. (See also shamanism.)
Early 21st-century population estimates indicated some 200 individuals of Tanana descent.
