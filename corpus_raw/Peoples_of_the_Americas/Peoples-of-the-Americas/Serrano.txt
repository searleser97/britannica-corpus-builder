Serrano,  North American Indian group speaking a Uto-Aztecan language and originally inhabiting a mountainous region of what is now southern California. Serrano means “mountain dweller” in Spanish. One band, the Kitanemuk, lived in the Kern and San Joaquin river basins; another band, the Vanyume, resided along the Mojave River; and a third, the Serrano proper, held the San Bernardino Mountains, adjacent valleys, and a portion of the Mojave Desert.
All three bands were hunting and gathering cultures that knew how to subsist in a difficult environment; small game, acorns, piñon nuts, and berries were their dietary staples. Within villages the people were organized into patrilineal clans, with each clan having a hereditary chief and assistant chief. Dwellings were wickiups (wigwams), circular domed structures of willow branches covered with tule (rush) thatching. Most villages also had a ceremonial house where the chief lived, as well as a heated sweat lodge for bathing and ritual purification.
Early 21st-century population estimates indicated some 500 individuals of Serrano descent.
