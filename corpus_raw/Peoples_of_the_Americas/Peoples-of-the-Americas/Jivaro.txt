Jívaro,  South American Indian people living in the Montaña (the eastern slopes of the Andes), in Ecuador and Peru north of the Marañón River. They speak a language of the Jebero-Jivaroan group. No recent and accurate Jívaro census has been completed; population estimates ranged from 15,000 to 50,000 individuals in the early 21st century.
The Jívaro have a tropical-forest agriculture, growing cassava, corn (maize), sweet potatoes, and other crops supplemented by the gathering of wild fruits, fishing, and hunting. The blowgun and poisoned darts are their chief weapons. Related families live in a single large community house rather than in a village.
Like other peoples of the Montaña, the Jívaro are warlike. Although influenced by Jesuit missionary efforts, they remain proud that they were never really conquered. The Jívaro are known for their technique of shrinking human heads to the size of an orange. These shrunken heads (tsantsas) are prepared by removing the skin and boiling it; hot stones and sand are then put inside the skin to shrink it further. Headhunting was motivated by a desire for revenge and by the belief that a head gave the taker supernatural power.
