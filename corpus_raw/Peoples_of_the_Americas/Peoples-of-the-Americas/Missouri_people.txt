Missouri, self-name Niutachi,  North American Indian people of the Chiwere branch of the Siouan language family. In their historic past the Missouri people, together with the Iowa and the Oto, separated from the Ho-Chunk (Winnebago) and moved southwest. The Missouri tribe settled at the confluence of the Grand and Missouri rivers in what is now the state of Missouri, U.S., while the Oto continued to travel up the Missouri and its tributaries to what is now the state of Iowa. The French Jesuit missionary explorer Jacques Marquette and French Canadian explorer Louis Jolliet encountered the tribe on the Missouri River in 1673. Defeated in a war with the Sauk and Fox in 1798, the remnants of the Missouri scattered to live with the Osage, the Kansa, and the Oto. By 1805 some of the Missouri people had reassembled, and they were encountered south of the Platte River (where they had moved after a smallpox epidemic had taken its toll) by the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Another defeat—this time by the Osage—further reduced their numbers. By 1885 fewer than 50 Missouri remained. These individuals allied themselves variously with the Oto and the Iowa.
Early 21st-century population estimates indicated some 2,500 descendants of the combined Oto and Missouri tribes.
