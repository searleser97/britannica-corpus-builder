Quechan, also called Yuma,  California Indian people of the fertile Colorado River valley who, together with the Mojave and other groups of the region (collectively known as River Yumans), shared some of the traditions of the Southwest Indians. They lived in riverside hamlets, and among the structures they built were houses consisting of log frameworks covered with sand, brush, or wattle and daub. Despite low precipitation and a desert climate, the river provided abundant water, flooding each spring and providing fresh silt and moisture to the small irregular fields of the Quechan, in which several varieties of corn (maize) were grown. The Quechan also cultivated pumpkins, melons, and beans, as well as grasses. In addition to their plentiful harvests, they gathered seeds and fruits, hunted small game, and fished. Their language is also called Quechan. It is a Yuman language grouped with the Hokan languages.
Most contemporary Quechan live on the Fort Yuma–Quechan Reservation near Yuma, Ariz., west of the Colorado River. It borders Mexico and California. Some of the reservation land is still farmed. The Fort Yuma–Quechan Museum, established in what was once the Fort Yuma officer’s mess, presents a history of the tribe and its relations with early Spanish missionaries and explorers and the American military. The Quechan own and operate casinos and a number of other small enterprises mostly related to tourism. In the early 21st century, descendants of the Quechan numbered some 2,500.
