Lydia Folger Fowler, née Lydia Folger,  (born May 5, 1822, Nantucket, Mass., U.S.—died Jan. 26, 1879, London, Eng.), physician, writer, and reformer, one of the first American women to hold a medical degree and to become a professor of medicine in an American college.
Lydia Folger attended the Wheaton Seminary in Norton, Massachusetts, from 1838 to 1839 and taught there from 1842 to 1844. In 1844 she married Lorenzo Niles Fowler, a well-known phrenologist and one of a family of promoters in that field. Lydia Fowler soon took to the lecture circuit as a phrenologist herself, and she wrote Familiar Lessons on Physiology (1847), Familiar Lessons on Phrenology (1847), and Familiar Lessons on Astronomy (1848) for the family publishing firm of Fowlers & Wells. In 1849 she entered Central Medical College, an eclectic institution in Syracuse, New York. During her second term, by which time the college had moved to Rochester, New York, she served also as principal of the “Female Department.” On graduating in June 1850 she became the second woman, after Elizabeth Blackwell, to receive a medical degree.
In 1851 Fowler was appointed professor of midwifery and diseases of women and children at the college, becoming thereby the first woman professor in an American medical college. From the closing of the school in 1852 until 1860, she lived and practiced in New York City. She also lectured frequently to women on hygiene and physiology, championed the further opening of the medical profession to women, and became active in the women’s rights and temperance movements. During 1860–61 she studied medicine in Paris and London, and in 1862 she became an instructor in clinical midwifery at the New York Hygeio-Therapeutic College in New York City. In 1863 she and her husband moved to London permanently. In that year she published a temperance novel, Nora: The Lost and Redeemed. The Pet of the Household and How to Save It (1865) was a collection of lectures on child care, and Heart-Melodies (1870) was verse.
