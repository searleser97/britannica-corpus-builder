Mercy Ruggles Bisbe Jackson, née Mercy Ruggles,  (born Sept. 17, 1802, Hardwick, Mass., U.S.—died Dec. 13, 1877, Boston, Mass.), American physician and educator, a pioneer in the struggle for the admission of women to the practice of medicine.
Mercy Ruggles received what was for the time a good education. In June 1823 she married the Reverend John Bisbe, with whom she moved to Hartford, Connecticut, and later to Portland, Maine. After his death in 1829, she supported herself and her children by operating a girls’ school until 1832, when she opened a dry-goods store. In 1835 she married Captain Daniel Jackson of Plymouth, Massachusetts. Her long-standing interest in medicine, particularly the treatment of children (of which she had 11), was given added impetus in 1848 when a Plymouth physician began giving her books and medicines. Soon she had a thriving practice in homeopathic medicine. After her second husband’s death in 1852, she entered the New England Female Medical College, from which she graduated in 1860.
Mercy Jackson then settled in Boston and began a practice. In 1861 she applied for membership in the American Institute of Homeopathy (headquartered in Philadelphia) but was rejected on account of her sex. Her annual reapplications were similarly rejected until June 1871, when the institute admitted three women. Two years later she was admitted to both the Massachusetts and the Boston homeopathic societies. Also in 1873 she was appointed adjunct professor of the diseases of children at the newly opened Boston University School of Medicine. She continued to teach and to carry on a large practice until her death. She was also a supporter of and lecturer on temperance and woman suffrage and a frequent contributor to the Boston Woman’s Journal.
