Martha Wollstein,  (born Nov. 21, 1868, New York, N.Y., U.S.—died  Sept. 30, 1939, New York City), American physician and investigator in pediatric pathology.
Wollstein graduated from the Woman’s Medical College of the New York Infirmary in 1889. In 1890 she joined the staff of the Babies Hospital in New York City, where she was appointed pathologist in 1892. Her first experimental work involved infant diarrhea and confirmed earlier studies relating the dysentery bacillus to the disease. Her study brought her to the attention of the Rockefeller Institute of Medical Research in New York City, where she collaborated on the first experimental work on polio in the United States. There she also worked on an early investigation of pneumonia and developed, with Harold Amoss, a method for preparing antimeningitis serum. She also pioneered in early research on mumps, indicating, though not proving, its viral nature.
After 1921 Wollstein investigated pediatric pathology at the Babies Hospital, especially jaundice, congenital anomalies, tuberculosis, meningitis, and leukemia. Her publications and reports during that period are considered her greatest contribution, for she deeply influenced the physicians affiliated with the hospital during her tenure there. Wollstein published 80 scientific papers during her lifetime.
