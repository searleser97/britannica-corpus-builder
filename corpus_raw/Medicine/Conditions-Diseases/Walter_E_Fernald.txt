Walter E. Fernald, in full Walter Elmore Fernald,  (born 1859, Kittery, Maine, U.S.—died November 26, 1924, Waverley, Massachusetts), American doctor and administrator who was known for his work with the intellectually disabled in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
After graduating from the Medical School of Maine in 1881, Fernald worked (1882–87) at a hospital in Wisconsin. In 1887 he became superintendent of the Massachusetts School for the Feeble-Minded (later known as the Walter E. Fernald Development Center) in Waltham. The institution, which had been founded by Samuel Gridley Howe in 1848, was the first public asylum in the United States specifically created to house intellectually disabled people. There Fernald became a prominent supporter of institutionalizing people with intellectual disabilities. For many years, he wrote about what he called “the burden of the feeble-minded” on the rest of society, and, although he advocated for the humane care of the intellectually disabled, he was an active proponent of involuntary sterilization, at the same time that eugenics laws were being passed by state legislatures throughout the country.
Fernald changed some of his views before the end of his life. He became a supporter of community placement for many of those he previously characterized as part of “a parasitic, predatory class,” eventually moving many institutional residents into smaller, community-based residences. He also came to reject forced sterilization.
