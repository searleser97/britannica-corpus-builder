Sir Edwin Chadwick,  (born Jan. 24, 1800, Longsight, Lancashire, Eng.—died  July 6, 1890, East Sheen, Surrey), lawyer and social reformer who devoted his life to sanitary reform in Britain.
As secretary of the royal commission on reform of the poor laws (1834–46), Chadwick was largely responsible for devising the system under which the country was divided into groups of parishes administered by elected boards of guardians, each board with its own medical officer. Later, as commissioner of the Board of Health (1848–54), he conducted a campaign that culminated in passage of the Public Health Act of 1848. This legislation embodied his belief that public health should be administered locally so as to encourage the people to participate in their own protection. Among his writings is the historic Report . . . on an Enquiry into the Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population of Great Britain (1842). He was knighted in 1889.
