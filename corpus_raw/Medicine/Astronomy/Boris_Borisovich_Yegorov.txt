Boris Borisovich Yegorov,  (born November 26, 1937, Moscow, Russia, U.S.S.R.—died September 12, 1994, Moscow, Russia), Soviet physician who, with cosmonauts Vladimir M. Komarov and Konstantin P. Feoktistov, was a participant in the first multimanned spaceflight, that of Voskhod (“Sunrise”) 1, on October 12–13, 1964, and was also the first practicing physician in space.
Upon graduating in 1961 from the First Medical Institute, Moscow, Yegorov joined the team of physicians who studied medical telemetry data from Soviet spaceflights. An expert on the sense-of-balance mechanism in the inner ear, he began training for the Voskhod 1 flight during the summer of 1964. During the flight (which, with an apogee of 254 miles [409 km], was then the highest attained by a manned capsule), Yegorov tested the effects of radiation, confinement, weightlessness, and various other conditions of spaceflight on himself and the other cosmonauts. The flight was the first undertaken in woolen clothes rather than the usual space suits. It was suggested at the time that a longer flight had been planned, which was why a doctor was included. Yegorov was not a trained long-term professional cosmonaut and returned to medical practice. The medical information gained from the Voskhod 1 flight and subsequent research enabled Soviet scientists to make advances in adapting humans to long spaceflights.
