Andrea Cesalpino, Latin Andreas Caesalpinus,  (born June 6, 1519, Arezzo, Tuscany [Italy]—died  Feb. 23, 1603, Rome), Italian physician, philosopher, and botanist who sought a philosophical and theoretical approach to plant classification based on unified and coherent principles rather than on alphabetical sequence or medicinal properties. He helped establish botany as an independent science.
Cesalpino succeeded his teacher, Luca Ghini, as professor of medicine and director of the botanical gardens at the University of Pisa. From 1592 he served as physician to Pope Clement VIII and taught at Sapienza University in Rome. His work on the anatomy and physiology of the cardiovascular system anticipated the work of William Harvey. His De plantis libri XVI (1583) is considered the first textbook of botany. The brief first book presents the principles of botany using the models of Aristotle and Theophrastus; the remaining 15 books describe and classify more than 1,500 plants. While his classification system anticipated Linnaeus’ system of binomial nomenclature, Cesalpino retained the false classic divisions of woody and herbaceous plants and the belief that plants are not sexual. He profoundly influenced later botanists such as Linnaeus.
