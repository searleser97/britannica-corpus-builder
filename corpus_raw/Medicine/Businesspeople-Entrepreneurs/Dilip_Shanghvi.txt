Dilip Shanghvi, in full Dilip Shantilal Shanghvi,  (born October 1, 1955, Amreli, Gujarat state, India), Indian business executive who was the founder (1983) of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.
The son of a wholesale drug distributor, Shanghvi launched Sun Pharma soon after graduating (1982) from the University of Calcutta with a bachelor’s degree in commerce. He assumed the post of managing director. Initially, the company marketed only a small number of psychiatric drugs, but by the early 1990s it had opened its own research and manufacturing facilities and added product lines in the fields of cardiology and gastroenterology. Shanghvi took the company public in 1994. Three years later Sun Pharma made its first international acquisition when it bought Detroit-based Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories; it also took equity stakes in two prominent Indian drug manufacturers, Tamilnadu Dadha Pharmaceuticals and MJ Pharmaceuticals.
Under Shanghvi’s leadership, Sun Pharma continued to expand at a rapid rate, acquiring more than a dozen companies and brands between 1999 and 2012. The firm’s 2010 purchase of a controlling stake in Taro Pharmaceutical Industries—following a three-year takeover battle—almost immediately doubled its U.S. revenues to more than $1 billion. In 2015 Shanghvi oversaw the completion of the company’s $3.2 billion acquisition of generic-drug rival Ranbaxy Laboratories from Japan-based pharmaceutical giant Daiichi Sankyo Co. The deal made Sun Pharma the fifth largest generic-drug producer in the world as well as the largest pharmaceutical company in India.
Aside from his work at Sun Pharma, Shanghvi was active as a personal investor, with interests that increasingly extended beyond pharmaceuticals, notably in the field of renewable energy. In 2018 he became a member of the Reserve Bank of India’s central board.
