Paul Nurse, in full Sir Paul Maxime Nurse,  (born January 25, 1949, Norwich, Norfolk, England), British scientist who, with Leland H. Hartwell and R. Timothy Hunt, won the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 2001 for discovering key regulators of the cell cycle.
Nurse earned a Ph.D. from the University of East Anglia in 1973 and was a professor at the University of Oxford from 1987 to 1993. He also held various positions at the Imperial Cancer Research Fund (ICRF; now Cancer Research UK), notably serving as director-general (1996–2002) and chief executive (2002–03). In 2003 he became president of Rockefeller University in New York City, a post he held until 2011. That year Nurse became director and chief executive of the UK Centre for Medical Research and Innovation (now the Francis Crick Institute).
In the mid-1970s Nurse, using yeast as his model organism, discovered the gene cdc2. His research demonstrated that the gene served as a master switch, regulating the timing of cell-cycle events, such as division. In 1987 Nurse isolated the corresponding gene in humans, which was named cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (cdk1). The gene encodes a protein that belongs to a family of key enzymes, the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which participate in many cell functions. By 2001 about a half dozen other CDKs were identified in humans.
Nurse’s work aided in the scientific understanding of cancer. He was knighted in 1999, and in 2005 he received the Royal Society’s Copley Medal. On July 8, 2010, Nurse was confirmed as president-elect of the Royal Society. He began his five-year term in December.
