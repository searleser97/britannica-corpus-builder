Sir Robert Sibbald,  (born April 15, 1641, Edinburgh—died  August 1722), Scottish physician and antiquarian, who became the first professor of medicine at the University of Edinburgh (1685), which became thereafter, for more than a century, one of the greatest centres of medical research in Europe.
Sibbald spent a considerable portion of his early youth in Fifeshire and was educated at a high school in Edinburgh and at the University of Edinburgh. In 1660 he went to Leiden (Leyden), Neth., where the following year he took an M.D., and then went on to Paris and, later, Angers, Fr., where he secured a doctorate (1662). Soon afterward he settled as a physician in Edinburgh.
In 1667, with Sir Andrew Balfour, he started a botanical garden for the purpose of locally cultivating medicinal herbs. He also took a leading role in establishing the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, which was chartered in 1681 and of which he was elected president in 1684. In 1685 he secured his professorship at the university. He was appointed physician to King Charles II in 1682 and to James II in 1685.
For many years before and after his appointment as geographer-royal of Scotland in 1682, he compiled collections of geographic and statistical data, much of which appear in such works as An Account of the Scottish Atlas (1683), The History, Ancient and Modern, of the Sheriffdoms of Linlithgow and Stirling (1710), An Account of the Writers Ancient and Modern . . . of North Britain, called Scotland (1710), and Description of the Islands of Orkney and Zetland with the Maps of Them (1711). Sibbald’s most elaborate work, Scotia Illustrata (1684), which was a natural history of Scotland, perhaps relied too much on hearsay and unreliable correspondents and was severely attacked by critics.
Sibbald also wrote many medical and scientific treatises, many in Latin.
