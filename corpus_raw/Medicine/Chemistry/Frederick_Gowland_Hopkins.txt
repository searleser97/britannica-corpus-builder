Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins,  (born June 20, 1861, Eastbourne, East Sussex, Eng.—died  May 16, 1947, Cambridge), British biochemist, who received (with Christiaan Eijkman) the 1929 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for discovery of essential nutrient factors—now known as vitamins—needed in animal diets to maintain health.
In 1901 Hopkins discovered the amino acid tryptophan, isolated it from protein, and eventually (1906–07) showed that it and certain other amino acids (known as essential amino acids) cannot be manufactured by certain animals from other nutrients and must be supplied in the diet. Noticing that rats failed to grow on a diet of artificial milk but grew rapidly when a small quantity of cow’s milk was added to their daily ration, Hopkins realized that no animal can live on a mixture of pure protein, fat, and carbohydrate, even when mineral salts are added, and termed the missing factors—later called vitamins—“accessory substances.”
In 1907 Hopkins and Sir Walter Fletcher laid the foundations for a modern understanding of the chemistry of muscular contraction when they demonstrated that working muscle accumulates lactic acid. Fifteen years later, Hopkins isolated from living tissue the tripeptide (three amino acids linked in sequence) glutathione and showed that it is vital to the utilization of oxygen by the cell.
Hopkins spent most of his career at Cambridge University (1898–1943). He was knighted in 1925 and received many other honours, including the presidency of the Royal Society (1930) and the Order of Merit (1935).
