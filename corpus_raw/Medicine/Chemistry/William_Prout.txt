William Prout,  (born Jan. 15, 1785, Horton, Gloucestershire, Eng.—died  April 9, 1850, London), English chemist and biochemist noted for his discoveries concerning digestion, metabolic chemistry, and atomic weights.
The son of a tenant farmer, Prout graduated from the University of Edinburgh in 1811 with a medical degree. Thereafter he practiced as a successful physician, specializing in the treatment of urinary and digestive ailments. Prout’s other career, as an experimentalist and theorist, was many-sided. Between 1815 and 1827 he published a number of papers that helped establish the barely explored areas of metabolic and physiological chemistry. He discovered that the gastric juices of animals contain significant amounts of hydrochloric acid. He was one of the first to extract pure urea from urine; he discovered uric acid in excrement; and he published a large and authoritative textbook on urinary and digestive pathology in 1840. Prout’s classification of food components into water, fats, carbohydrates, and proteins was quickly adopted by his fellow biochemists.
In 1815 Prout advanced the idea that the atomic weights of elements are whole-number multiples of the atomic weight of hydrogen (Prout’s hypothesis). This theory proved highly fruitful for later investigations of atomic weights, atomic theory, and the classification of the elements. Prout’s theory concerning the relative densities and weights of gases was in agreement with Avogadro’s law (1811), which was not generally accepted until the 1850s.
