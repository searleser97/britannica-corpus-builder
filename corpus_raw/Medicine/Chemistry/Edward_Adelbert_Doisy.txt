Edward Adelbert Doisy,  (born Nov. 13, 1893, Hume, Ill., U.S.—died  Oct. 23, 1986, St. Louis, Mo.), American biochemist who shared the 1943 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine with Henrik Dam for his isolation and synthesis of the antihemorrhagic vitamin K (1939), used in medicine and surgery.
Doisy earned his bachelor’s and master’s degrees at the University of Illinois and his Ph.D. at Harvard University (1920). He taught at Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Mo. (1919–23), and St. Louis University (1923–65; emeritus 1965–86). From 1922 to 1934 he worked with the embryologist Edgar Allen in developing assay techniques that facilitated research on sex hormones. Doisy and his associates isolated the sex hormones estrone (theelin, 1929; the first estrogen to be crystallized), estriol (theelol, 1930), and estradiol (dihydrotheelin, 1935). Vitamin K, a substance that encourages blood clotting, had been identified by Dam, and in 1936–39 Doisy isolated two forms of the vitamin, determined their chemical structures, and synthesized the vitamin.
Doisy’s writings include Sex Hormones (1936) and Sex and Internal Secretions (1939), with Edgar Allen and Charles H. Danforth.
