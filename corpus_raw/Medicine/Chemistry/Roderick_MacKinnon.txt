Roderick MacKinnon,  (born February 19, 1956, Burlington, Massachusetts, U.S.), American doctor, corecipient of the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 2003 for his pioneering research on ion channels in cell membranes. He shared the award with Peter Agre, also of the United States.
MacKinnon earned an M.D. degree from Tufts University School of Medicine in 1982. After practicing medicine for several years, he turned to basic research, beginning in 1986 with postdoctoral work on ion channels at Brandeis University. In 1989 he joined Harvard University, and in 1996 he moved to Rockefeller University as a professor and laboratory head. A year later he was appointed an investigator at Rockefeller’s Howard Hughes Medical Institute.
Of particular importance to the nervous system and the heart, ion channels are specialized openings in cell membranes that enable ions, such as potassium and sodium, to easily flow in and out of cells; similar structures also exist for the passage of water. MacKinnon’s groundbreaking work focused on “filters” in channels that passed one type of ion while blocking others. To understand how these filters work, he obtained sharper images of channels using X-ray diffraction. In 1998 he determined the three-dimensional molecular structure of an ion channel. The channel, MacKinnon discovered, has an architecture sized in a way that easily strips potassium ions—but not sodium ions—of their associated water molecules and allows them to slip through. He also found a molecular “sensor” in the end of the channel nearest the cell’s interior that reacts to conditions around the cell, sending signals that open and close the channel at the appropriate times. His pioneering work allowed scientists to pursue the development of drugs for diseases in which ion channels play a role.
