Martin Rodbell,  (born December 1, 1925, Baltimore, Maryland, U.S.—died December 7, 1998, Chapel Hill, North Carolina), American biochemist who was awarded the 1994 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for his discovery in the 1960s of natural signal transducers called G-proteins that help cells in the body communicate with each other. He shared the prize with American pharmacologist Alfred G. Gilman, who later proved Rodbell’s hypothesis by isolating the G-protein, which is so named because it binds to nucleotides called guanosine diphosphate and guanosine triphosphate, or GDP and GTP.
After graduating from Johns Hopkins University (B.A., 1949) and from the University of Washington (Ph.D., 1954), Rodbell began his career as a biochemist at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. From 1985 until his retirement in 1994 he worked at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, near Durham, North Carolina.
Prior to Rodbell’s research, scientists believed that only two substances—a hormone receptor and an interior cell enzyme—were responsible for cellular communication. Rodbell, however, discovered that the G-protein acted as an intermediate signal transducer between the two. Despite initial opposition, his theories gained acceptance, and subsequently more than 20 G-proteins were identified. His research led to better understanding of many diseases, including cholera, diabetes, alcoholism, and cancer.
