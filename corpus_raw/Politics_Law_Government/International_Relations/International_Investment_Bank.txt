International Investment Bank, Russian Mezhdunarodny Investitsionny Bank,  international bank, founded in 1970 and operational in 1971, designed to provide long- and medium-term credit for capital construction in member states. The founding members were Bulgaria, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Mongolia, Poland, Romania, and the Soviet Union. The bank is headquartered in Moscow and grants credits to the banks and economic enterprises of member states.
The dissolution of the U.S.S.R. and the Soviet bloc in 1991 left the bank in disarray for about two decades. In 2012 the bank underwent a major restructuring in order to implement modern financial practices and to establish new relationships with national and international financial institutions. The bank continued to operate in its Moscow headquarters, with a membership consisting of Bulgaria, Cuba, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Mongolia, Russia, Romania, Slovakia, and Vietnam. In 2015 it opened its first European regional office in Slovakia.
