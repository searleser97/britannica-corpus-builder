Muslim World League (MWL),  international nongovernmental organization founded in 1962 to propagate Islam and to improve worldwide understanding of the religion. The MWL is headquartered in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, and maintains offices in countries throughout the world.
The MWL works to improve Islamic mass media as a means of propagating Islam and Islamic culture, advocates for the application of Sharīʿah law by individuals and groups as well as by states, organizes symposia and other educational events, promotes the teaching of Arabic, and seeks to foster better relations between Islamic religious associations—in part by hosting meetings of leading Islamic scholars during the hajj, the annual pilgrimage to Mecca. Through a subsidiary body, the International Islamic Relief Organization, the organization also provides relief to Muslims who are affected by war and natural disasters. The MWL maintains consultative status with UNESCO (the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), UNICEF (the United Nations Children’s Fund), and the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).
The MWL is governed by a Constituent Council composed of 60 members drawn from leading Islamic organizations. The day-to-day management of the MWL is handled by a secretary-general, who reports to the Constituent Council. The MWL is funded by the government of Saudi Arabia.
