Treaty of Schönbrunn,  (Oct. 14, 1809), agreement signed at the Schloss Schönbrunn in Vienna after Austria’s premature war of liberation against Napoleon collapsed with its defeat at Wagram and its failure to get the Prussian support it had expected. Austria lost about 32,000 square miles (83,000 square km) of territory with approximately 3,500,000 inhabitants.
Under the terms of the treaty, France received Fiume, Istria, and Trieste, part of Croatia, and most of Carinthia and Carniola; Russia, having backed Napoleon, received the Tarnopol section of East Galicia; the Grand Duchy of Warsaw obtained West Galicia, with Kraków and Lublin; and Bavaria acquired Salzburg, Berchtesgaden, the Innviertel, and half of the Hausruckviertel. Austria also agreed to pay a large indemnity, reduce its army to 150,000 men, and break diplomatic and trade relations with Britain. The treaty was followed by a short period of close ties between France and Austria.
