Alliance for Progress,  former international economic development program established by the United States and 22 Latin American countries in the Charter of Punta del Este (Uruguay) in August 1961. Objectives stated in the charter centred on the maintenance of democratic government and the achievement of economic and social development; specific goals included a sustained growth in per capita income, more equitable distribution of income, accelerated development in industry and agriculture, agrarian reform, improvement of health and welfare, stabilization of export prices, and domestic price stability. The program was dissolved in 1973 by the Organization of American States.
At the start of the program, it was estimated that $20 billion of external capital would be needed during the first 10 years; about half was to be obtained from the United States and the rest from international lending agencies and from private sources. The Inter-American Committee on the Alliance for Progress (CIAP) was created in 1963 to serve as the coordinating agent between the international financial community and the countries involved and to review the economic policies and plans of each country to determine the need for and availability of external finance.
Although the program could show some newly built schools, hospitals, and other physical plants, it failed in the judgment of most observers. Massive land reform was not achieved; population more than kept pace with gains in health and welfare. U.S. aid decreased over the years, and political tensions between the United States and Latin America increased.
