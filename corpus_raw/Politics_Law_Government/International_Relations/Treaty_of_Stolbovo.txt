Treaty of Stolbovo,  (1617), peace settlement concluded between Sweden and Russia ending Sweden’s intervention in Russia’s internal political affairs and blocking Russia from the Baltic Sea. In 1610 Muscovite leaders, faced with a succession crisis, a war with Poland, and peasant uprisings (Time of Troubles, 1606–13), offered the Russian throne to Władysław, the son of the Polish king Sigismund III. This action provoked Sweden, then at war with Poland, to declare war on Russia and claim the Russian throne for the Sweden’s Prince Charles Philip.
The provisions of the treaty called for Sweden to return Novgorod and its other acquisitions in northern Russia to the Muscovite government but allowed Sweden to retain Karelia and Ingria, between Estonia and Finland, thus cutting off Russia’s access to the Baltic Sea. Moreover, the treaty required that Prince Charles Philip renounce his claim to the Russian throne. The treaty did not meet Swedish expectations of gaining control of Russia’s trade with western Europe by ending Russian control of the White Sea.
