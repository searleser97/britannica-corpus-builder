FINCA International, in full Foundation for International Community Assistance,  nongovernmental organization (NGO) that provides financial services for the world’s poorest populations. FINCA International offers banking services, insurance, and small loans to poor individuals at relatively modest interest rates and fees (microcredit). FINCA was founded in 1985 by American economist John Hatch and began by offering small amounts of working capital to low-income women entrepreneurs in El Salvador. The organization later expanded its operations to other countries in Central America, Africa, and Asia. FINCA lends primarily to women, in part because women constitute a majority of the world’s poor.
FINCA pioneered the Village Banking method, which is a leading global model for providing small amounts of credit to entrepreneurs. A Village Bank is capitalized with microloans extended to its individual members, usually 10 to 50 female heads of household. The group guarantees repayment of the microloan of each member, encourages savings, and eventually extends small-scale self-employment loans of its own.
FINCA is managed by an executive team based in Washington, D.C., which works in conjunction with a board of directors. It operates through wholly owned country subsidiaries, most of which are in poor and politically unstable countries. The subsidiaries are funded by a combination of private donations, interest income from operations, commercial lending sources, and donations from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), and foreign governments.
