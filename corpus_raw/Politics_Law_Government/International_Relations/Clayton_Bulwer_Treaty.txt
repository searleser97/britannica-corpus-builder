Clayton–Bulwer Treaty,  compromise agreement (signed April 19, 1850) designed to harmonize contending British and U.S. interests in Central America. Because of its equivocal language, it became one of the most discussed and difficult treaties in the history of Anglo-U.S. relations. It resulted from negotiations between Sir Henry Lytton Bulwer, British minister to Washington, and John M. Clayton, U.S. secretary of state.
The treaty provided that the two countries should jointly control and protect the canal that they expected soon to be built across the Isthmus of Panama. The treaty’s introductory article pledged a neutralized Central America, which neither signatory would “occupy, or fortify, or colonize, or assume or exercise any dominion over. . . .” The interpretation of this clause became the subject of a bitter dispute between the two governments. The United States held that the pledge not to “occupy” required renunciation on Britain’s part of certain interests, viz., a protectorate over the Mosquito Coast, a settlement in British Honduras and the Bay Islands. Britain’s counterposition on these matters was that the treaty recognized the status quo. When, after several decades, the canal was still unbuilt, there was popular demand in the United States for abrogation of the agreement to make possible a U.S.-controlled canal. The Clayton–Bulwer Treaty was finally superseded in 1901 with the conclusion of the second Hay–Pauncefote Treaty (q.v.) by which Britain agreed that the U.S. should construct and control the canal.
