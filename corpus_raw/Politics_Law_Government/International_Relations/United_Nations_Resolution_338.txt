United Nations Resolution 338,  resolution of the United Nations (UN) Security Council that called for an end to the Yom Kippur (October) War of 1973, in which Israel faced an offensive led by Egypt and Syria. The ambiguous three-line resolution, which was adopted unanimously (with one abstention) on October 22, 1973, called upon all parties to cease hostilities within 12 hours and to implement UN Resolution 242 (1967) “in all its parts.” It also explicitly called for the immediate start of negotiations (under “appropriate auspices”) aimed at reaching a lasting peace.
The resolution was accepted on October 22 by Egypt and Israel but not by Syria, which finally accepted it under Soviet pressure the following day. Hostilities continued in spite of the resolution, prompting the adoption of UN Resolutions 339 and 340 on October 23 and 25, respectively. It was only after the adoption of these resolutions, which reiterated the call to cease the fighting, that the Yom Kippur War finally ended.
