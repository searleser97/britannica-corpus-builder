Aroostook War,  (1838–39), bloodless conflict over the disputed boundary between the U.S. state of Maine and the British Canadian province of New Brunswick. The peace treaty of 1783 ending the American Revolution had left unclear the location of a supposed “highlands,” or watershed, dividing the two areas. Negotiators from Britain and the United States in subsequent years failed to come to an agreement, and the matter was referred to the king of the Netherlands, who in 1831 rendered a decision that the citizens of Maine objected to strenuously, forcing the U.S. Senate to reject it.
Meanwhile, settlers from New England and lumbermen from Canada were moving into the disputed Aroostook area, and in 1838–39 the conflict warmed up, with officials and bands of men from both sides making arrests and taking prisoners of “trespassers.” In March 1839 British troops from Quebec reached Madawaska, the American sector of Aroostook, and the Maine legislature immediately appropriated $800,000 and called for 10,000 volunteer militiamen, who, within a week, were dispatched to Aroostook. The U.S. Congress voted for 50,000 men and $10,000,000, and Gen. Winfield Scott was ordered to Augusta, Maine, by Pres. Martin Van Buren to keep the peace. On March 21, 1839, he and the British negotiator, Sir John Harvey, arranged a truce and a joint occupancy of the territory in dispute until a satisfactory settlement could be reached. The boundary was later settled by the Webster-Ashburton Treaty of 1842.
