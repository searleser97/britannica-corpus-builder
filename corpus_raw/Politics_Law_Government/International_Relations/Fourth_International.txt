Fourth International,  a multinational body composed of Trotskyist organizations that was first formed in opposition to the policies of the Stalin-dominated Third International, or Comintern.
The idea of a Fourth International was first presented in the late 1920s by various opponents of the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, particularly the followers of Leon Trotsky. Trotsky at first opposed the idea, but by July 1933, with the victory of Nazism in Germany, he called for a Fourth International, because he opposed the Comintern’s condoning of fascism. Trotsky also intended the Fourth International to unite the various anti-Stalinist splinter groups from communist parties around the world.
The formation of the new International was difficult, though, because Stalin’s secret police killed many potential Trotskyists in the period 1934–38, so that the ranks of the Trotskyist movement were thin. Nevertheless, a founding conference was held in Périgny, Fr., in 1938; it proclaimed the Fourth International and adopted a program calling for a broad range of goals between those of minimum reform (e.g., higher wages, better working conditions) and those of the maximum program (i.e., the overthrow of capitalism and the transition to socialism).
Trotsky died in 1940, and after World War II the Fourth International’s leadership fell to Michel Pablo and Ernest Germain, two Belgian Trotskyists. When in 1949 Pablo predicted “degenerated workers’ states for centuries” and, consequently, called for the dissolution of the International, a factional fight erupted, culminating in 1953 in the Fourth International’s split into two factions—the International Committee and the International Secretariat, which supported Pablo. The chief importance of the Fourth International lies in disseminating information to the many extreme left-wing groups affiliated to one or another of its fragments.
