Helen Keller International (HKI),  one of the oldest international nonprofit organizations working to prevent blindness and fight malnutrition. Headquarters are in New York City.
In 1915 the American merchant George Kessler and his wife, Cora Parsons Kessler, organized in Paris the British, French, and Belgian Permanent Relief War Fund. George Kessler had been aboard the Lusitania when it was sunk by a German torpedo. As a survivor, he vowed to help veterans in some way, eventually settling on helping those blinded in the war. He then recruited author and lecturer Helen Keller, who had been deaf and blind since childhood. The Kesslers and Keller worked together, forming an American branch of the Permanent Relief War Fund called the Permanent Blind Relief War Fund for Soldiers and Sailors of the Allies, which was incorporated in New York in 1919, with Keller and Cora Parsons Kessler as trustees.
In the 1920s the organization began serving blind civilians, as well as military personnel, and also began printing texts in Braille, a writing system for the blind that uses raised dots. This prompted the 1925 name change to the American Braille Press for War and Civilian Blind. Under this name the organization was one of the leading publishers of Braille texts, and it was responsible for the first “talking book” (1937). In 1946 the name changed yet again, to the American Foundation for the Overseas Blind, as its mission expanded to include rehabilitation of the blind.
In the late 1960s the focus again broadened, this time toward blindness prevention and treatment, including efforts to reduce malnutrition in children. One successful effort was the distribution of vitamin A to millions of children in developing countries. This campaign drastically reduced the number of cases of childhood blindness. The organization adopted the name Helen Keller International in 1977 to honour Keller’s contributions to the organization and to the blind and disadvantaged.
