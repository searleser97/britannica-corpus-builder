World Convention of Churches of Christ,   international agency of the Disciples of Christ. Its headquarters are in New York City. It exercises no authority over its member churches but does provide a means for fellowship and mutual activities for the various national churches.
It first met in Washington, D.C., in 1930 and was scheduled to meet at five-year intervals. Many of the churches outside the United States that are members of the agency are known as Churches of Christ in their own countries. These should not be confused with the American Churches of Christ, which generally do not participate in this agency.
