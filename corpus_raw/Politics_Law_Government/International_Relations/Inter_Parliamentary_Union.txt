Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU),  international organization of parliaments of sovereign states established in 1889 in Paris to promote representative democracy and world peace. The Nobel Prize for Peace was awarded eight times to leading personalities of the IPU in the organization’s early years (1901–27). The IPU moved its headquarters to Geneva in 1921.
Sir William Randal Cremer of Great Britain and Frédéric Passy of France organized the first international conference of parliamentarians, the Inter-Parliamentary Conference, in 1889 and decided to make it a regular event. The conference, now called the IPU Assembly, meets biannually, and additional conferences are held to analyze specific issues in greater depth. The IPU encourages parliamentarians to engage in dialogue about their experiences, leading them to learn from and better understand each other. The organization also works to promote parliamentary action by addressing international concerns in six main areas: representative democracy; peace and security; sustainable development; human rights and humanitarian law; women in politics; and education, science, and culture.
More than 140 national parliaments are members of the IPU, and several regional parliamentary assemblies are associate members. Most members are associated with one of six geopolitical groups, and each group determines its own officers and rules of procedure. The organization is directed by a secretary-general and a president. The IPU’s policy making body is a governing council composed of three representatives from each member parliament. Further, an executive committee oversees the IPU’s administration. There are also other committees, which function according to their own rules and report to the governing council. The IPU works closely with the United Nations and in cooperation with any other organization that maintains similar ideals.
