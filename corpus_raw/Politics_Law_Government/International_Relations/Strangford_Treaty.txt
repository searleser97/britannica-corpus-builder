Strangford Treaty,   (1810), agreement between the Portuguese government, then in exile in its Brazilian colony, and Great Britain, represented by its ambassador, Lord Strangford. The treaty provided for the importation of British manufactures into Brazil and the exportation of Brazilian agricultural produce to Great Britain; also, British naval vessels were allowed to be resupplied in Brazilian ports, British Protestants were given freedom of worship in Brazil, and cases involving British subjects resident in Brazil were to be tried only before judges appointed by the British crown. The treaty gave Britain the sole right to these commercial privileges in Brazil. Its initial effects on Brazilian manufacturing were deleterious, although it contributed in the long run to the nationâ€™s commerce.
