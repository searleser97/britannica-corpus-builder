Ausgleich, (German: “Compromise”)  also called Compromise of 1867,  the compact, finally concluded on Feb. 8, 1867, that regulated the relations between Austria and Hungary and established the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary. The kingdom of Hungary had desired equal status with the Austrian Empire, which was weakened by its defeat in the Seven Weeks’ War (Austro-Prussian War) of 1866. The Austrian emperor Francis Joseph gave Hungary full internal autonomy together with a responsible ministry, and in return Hungary agreed that the empire should still be a single great state for purposes of war and foreign affairs, thus maintaining its dynastic prestige abroad.
