Treaty of Belgrade,  (September 1739), either of two peace settlements achieved by the Ottoman Empire that ended a four-year war with Russia and a two-year war with Austria.
Disputes arising from ill-defined frontiers between Russian-ruled Ukraine and the Ottoman-dominated Crimean Tatars provided the pretext in 1735 for a new Russian attempt to establish itself on the northern Black Sea. Austria entered the war as Russia’s ally in 1737. Because of military failures, however, Austria made a separate peace in September 1739, ceding northern Serbia (with Belgrade) and Little Walachia (in southern Romania) to the Ottomans and thus renouncing the strong position in the Balkans it had obtained under the Treaty of Passarowitz (1718). With Austria’s defection, the militarily successful Russians had to make a disappointing peace that same month: Azov, which they had captured, was to be demilitarized, Russia was to have no warships on the Sea of Azov or the Black Sea, and it was to depend entirely on Ottoman shipping for its commerce on the Black Sea.
The treaties, mediated and guaranteed by France, provided relatively stable conditions until 1768.
