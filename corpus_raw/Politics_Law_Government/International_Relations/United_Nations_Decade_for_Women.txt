United Nations Decade for Women,  United Nations program that began on January 1, 1976, the goal of which was the promotion of equal rights and opportunities for women around the world.
Included in this decade were three major meetings for women. The first UN women’s conference, held in Mexico City in 1975, designated 1975–85 as the UN Decade for Women, and five months later the UN General Assembly launched that program. The second UN women’s conference was held in Copenhagen in 1980, and the third UN women’s conference was held in Nairobi in 1985. The participants at these meetings discussed issues such as pay equity, violence against women, landholding, and basic human rights.
The UN Decade for Women concentrated mainly on women and development. The UN women’s conference in Mexico City produced two major documents: the “Declaration of Mexico on the Equality of Women and Their Contribution to Development and Peace” and the “World Plan of Action for the Implementation of the Objectives of the International Women’s Year.” The conference in Copenhagen was used to report on progress since the Mexico City meeting and produced a “Programme of Action.” The conference in Nairobi celebrated the accomplishments of the Decade for Women and established an agenda that would guide future efforts to promote worldwide equality for women. The Nairobi conference adopted a document titled “The Nairobi Forward-Looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women.” A Fourth World Conference on Women was held in Beijing in September 1995 to accelerate the implementation of the policies outlined in that document.
The UN Decade for Women and its conferences helped establish the legitimacy of women’s issues regarding their roles as workers in the home and outside it. The decade also brought the many inequalities women face in education, health care, and work to the attention of national leaders and the general public.
