Truce of Andrusovo, Polish Andruszow,  (Jan. 30 [Feb. 9, New Style], 1667), long-lasting treaty that ended the Thirteen Years’ War (1654–67) between Russia and Poland for control of Ukraine. In 1654 the Russian government accepted the Pereyaslav Agreement, a proposal to annex Ukraine made by the hetman (military leader) of the Zaporozhian Cossacks, Bohdan Khmelnytsky, who had led a revolt in Ukraine against Polish rule (1648–54). That agreement precipitated war between Poland and Russia. During the war, control of Ukraine shifted back and forth many times, and the allegiances of the inhabitants became sharply divided, some preferring Russian rule, others Polish.
In 1664 peace negotiations began. Although Polish military achievements and Russian exhaustion gave Poland a negotiating advantage, the outbreak of a new rebellion forced the Poles to accept terms favourable to Russia. According to the truce, Ukraine was divided along the Dnieper River; Russia received the eastern portion of Ukraine, the city of Kiev, and the provinces of Smolensk and Seversk. The truce was confirmed by a treaty concluded in 1686.
