International PEN,  international organization of writers. The original PEN was founded in London in 1921 by the English novelist John Galsworthy, and it has since grown to include writers worldwide. The name PEN is an acronym standing for “poets, playwrights, editors, essayists, and novelists.” International PEN promotes international intellectual exchanges and goodwill among writers. It promotes freedom of expression for all writers regardless of their nationality, race, or religion, or of the political system under which they live. PEN is especially active in defending and supporting writers who are being harassed, persecuted, or oppressed by their government. The organization also bestows literary awards, sponsors translations of works written in obscure or neglected languages, holds conferences on current politico-literary topics, and publishes pamphlets and newsletters. To become a member of PEN an author must usually have published at least two books, one of which shows considerable literary distinction. PEN is headquartered in London, and there are more than 80 PEN Centres (branch organizations) situated in a total of about 60 countries worldwide.
