Young Men’s and Young Women’s Hebrew Association (YM–YWHA), also called Jewish Community Centre,  Jewish community organization in various countries that provides a wide range of cultural, educational, recreational, and social activities for all age groups in Jewish communities. The goals of the YM–YWHA are to prepare the young for participation in a democratic society, to ensure Judaism’s role as a positive element in community life, and to further the cultural unity of the Jewish community.
Jewish community centres originated in the Jewish young men’s literary societies that were formed in U.S. cities in the 1840s. The first organization to be called the Young Men’s Hebrew Association was established in Baltimore, Md., in 1854. The first women’s organization (YWHA) began as an auxiliary of the New York YMHA in the 1880s, with the first independent YWHA being established in 1902. These men’s and women’s organizations eventually merged into single entities.
There were more than 750,000 members in more than 400 Jewish Community Centres or YM–YWHA’s in 240 U.S. and Canadian cities by the late 20th century. Many of these centres sponsored day camps, summer camps, and nursery schools, as well as concerts, arts-and-crafts programs, lectures, and physical- and health-education programs. The centre movement has spread to some 20 other countries around the world and is linked through the World Federation of YMHA’s and Jewish Community Centres.
