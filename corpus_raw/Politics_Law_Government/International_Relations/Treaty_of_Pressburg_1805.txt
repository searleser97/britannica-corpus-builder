Treaty of Pressburg,  (Dec. 26, 1805), agreement signed by Austria and France at Pressburg (now Bratislava, Slovakia) after Napoleon’s victories at Ulm and Austerlitz; it imposed severe terms on Austria. Austria gave up the following: all that it had received of Venetian territory at the Treaty of Campo Formio (see Campo Formio, Treaty of) to Napoleon’s kingdom of Italy; the Tirol, Vorarlberg, and several smaller territories to Bavaria; and other western lands of the Habsburg monarchy to Württemberg and Baden. Austria agreed to admit the electors of Bavaria and Württemberg, who were allied to Napoleon, to the rank of kings, and to release them, as well as Baden, from all feudal ties with the defunct Holy Roman Empire, thus sharply reducing Austrian influence in Germany. Austria agreed to pay an indemnity of 40,000,000 gold francs. As small compensation, Napoleon allowed Austria to annex Salzburg, Berchtesgaden, and the estates of the Teutonic Order. The French Empire received Piedmont, Parma, and Piacenza, and completely excluded Austria from influence in Italy. The treaty was an integral part of Napoleon’s policy of creating a ring of French client states beyond the Rhine, the Alps, and the Pyrenees.
