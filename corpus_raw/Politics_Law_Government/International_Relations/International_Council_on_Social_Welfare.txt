It was founded in Paris in 1928. Its international headquarters are in Utrecht, Neth., and Kampala, Ugan.
The ICSW assists its member organizations by providing information and direct consultation, by lobbying local and national governments, and by attending international meetings and coordinating policy with other international organizations. It produces numerous publications, including the Global Social Policy Journal and International Social Work. The ICSW has consultative status at the United Nations.
The ICSW is governed by a committee composed of representatives of the ICSW’s nine regions: Central and West Africa, East and Southern Africa, South Asia, South East Asia and the Pacific, North East Asia, Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, North America, and Latin America and the Caribbean. The group’s president and executive staff are selected from this governing body. The ICSW is funded through membership fees and grants. In the early 21st century the largest government donors included Finland, Norway, and Sweden.
