Population Council,  international nonprofit nongovernmental organization (NGO) founded in 1952 to contribute to an equitable and sustainable balance between the needs of the worldâ€™s population and available resources. The Population Council is especially active in three areas: HIV/AIDS; reproductive health; and poverty, gender, and youth. Headquarters are in New York City, with additional offices in several countries across the globe.
The Population Council undertakes research in a number of areas related to population growth and control. It also performs operations research, provides technical assistance, and sponsors research and development on reproductive physiology. The organization licenses its own contraceptive technology around the world to assist with family planning. The Population Council is also concerned with the welfare of women and youth around the world and is active in combating practices such as female genital cutting, financial illiteracy, sexual and gender-based violence, forced marriage, and social isolation. Council-supported projects include the Community-based Health Planning and Services (CHPS), in Ghana; the African Forum on Emergency Contraception (ECafrique), aimed at increasing access to contraceptives in Africa; and the Expanding Community Healthcare Accessibility Network (ExCHANGE), which seeks to implement strategies developed by CHPS in other sub-Saharan African countries. The Population Council receives funding from various governments, multilateral organizations, foundations, and corporations, as well as from individuals.
