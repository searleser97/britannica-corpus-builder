Treaty of Chaumont,  (1814) treaty signed by Austria, Prussia, Russia, and Britain binding them to defeat Napoleon. The British foreign secretary Viscount Castlereagh played a leading part in negotiating the treaty, by which the signatories undertook not to negotiate separately, and promised to continue the struggle until Napoleon was overthrown. The treaty tightened allied unity and made provision for a durable European settlement.
