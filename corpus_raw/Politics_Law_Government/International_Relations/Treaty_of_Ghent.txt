Treaty of Ghent,  (Dec. 24, 1814), agreement in Belgium between Great Britain and the United States to end the War of 1812 on the general basis of the status quo antebellum (maintaining the prewar conditions). Because the military positions for each side were so well balanced, neither country could obtain desired concessions. No mention was made in the peace settlement of neutral rights, particularly concerning the impressment of seamen—one of the prime reasons the United States had gone to war. (International protection of neutral rights was not achieved until 1856 in the Declaration of Paris at the end of the Crimean War.) Expansionist interests in the American Northwest were better served, since all British-held territory in this area was surrendered to the United States. This severance of British–American Indian ties led in 1814 and 1815 to a number of treaties of allegiance and land transfer between the Indians and the United States and thus opened the way to American settlement of the Northwest. The treaty also provided that certain boundary disputes between Canada and the United States be referred to arbitration commissions, and both the U.S. and British governments agreed to use their best efforts to abolish the international slave trade.
