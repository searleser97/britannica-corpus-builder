Inter-American Development Bank (IDB),  Spanish Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo,  international organization founded in 1959 by 20 governments in North and South America to finance economic and social development in the Western Hemisphere. The largest charter subscribers were Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela, and the United States. Subscribers now include nearly 30 countries in North and South America and more than 15 countries in Europe, as well as Japan and Israel. During its first 40 years the bank distributed more than $85 billion in loans, and by the beginning of the 21st century its annual loan disbursement had exceeded $10 billion.
Headquartered in Washington, D.C., each member has representation on the Board of Governors, the bank’s chief policy-making organ, which meets at least once each year. Voting is weighted, based on a member’s subscription share. The United States exercises about 30 percent of the votes—nearly triple that of the next largest subscribers, Argentina and Brazil. The voting share of countries outside the Americas is about 15 percent, with nearly one-third of that exercised by Japan.
Created to hasten economic development in Latin America, the bank provides funding and technical assistance, coordinates economic development, and jointly finances loans with other institutions. Many of its loans are granted to improve the conditions of the poor in developing countries of the region. The IDB also includes the Inter-American Investment Corporation, which began operations in 1986 and serves as an autonomous affiliate charged with providing long-term loans to help modernize small and medium-sized private businesses; and the Multilateral Investment Fund (MIF), which was created in 1993 to help develop the private sector in Latin America and the Caribbean.
