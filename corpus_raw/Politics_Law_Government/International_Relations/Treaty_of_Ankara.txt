Treaty of Ankara, also called Franklin-Bouillon Agreement,  (Oct. 20, 1921), pact between the government of France and the Grand National Assembly of Turkey at Ankara, signed by the French diplomat Henri Franklin-Bouillon and Yusuf Kemal Bey, the Turkish nationalist foreign minister. It formalized the de facto recognition by France of the Grand National Assembly, rather than the government of the Ottoman sultan Mehmed VI, as the sovereign power in Turkey.
The Turkish government in Ankara had refused to ratify the Treaty of Sèvres (Aug. 10, 1920), which had been signed by the sultan and which had awarded parts of western Turkey to Greece; reaction to the treaty brought about a Turkish nationalist revival. After defeats by Turkish nationalists in southeastern Anatolia (Cilicia) in 1920–21, the French decided to withdraw southward and strengthen their forces in Syria and Lebanon. Under the terms of the Treaty of Ankara, the French agreed to evacuate Cilicia. A “special administrative regime” was established in Hatay (Alexandretta), and the Turkish-Syrian boundary was fixed.
The agreement assisted the Turkish nationalist cause by revealing differences between France and Great Britain, which continued to recognize the sultan’s government in Istanbul, and by releasing Turkish nationalist forces from the southeastern front for fighting on the western front against the Greeks.
