Treaty of Deogaon,  (Dec. 17, 1803), pact concluded by Sir Arthur Wellesley (later 1st duke of Wellington) between Raghuji Bhonsle II—the Maratha raja of Berar—and the British East India Company. With the Treaty of Surji-Arjungaon (Dec. 30, 1803), it marked the end of the first phase of the Second Maratha War (1803–05). By this treaty the raja of Berar ceded Cuttack and Balasore in Orissa to the company, thus making British territory continuous between Calcutta (now Kolkata) and Madras (now Chennai).
The Bhonsle ceded to Nizam Ali Khan of Hyderabad all of Berar west of the Wardha River. By agreeing to receive a British resident and subsidiary force at his capital, the Bhonsle dynasty became dependent on the British East India Company.
