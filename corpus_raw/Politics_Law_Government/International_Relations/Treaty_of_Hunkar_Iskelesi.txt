Treaty of Hünkâr İskelesi,  Hünkâr İskelesi also spelled Unkiar Skelessi,  (July 8, 1833), defensive alliance signed between the Ottoman Empire and Russia at the village of Hünkâr İskelesi, near Istanbul, by which the Ottoman Empire became a virtual protectorate of Russia.
Facing defeat by the insurgent Muḥammad ʿAlī Pasha of Egypt, the Ottoman sultan Mahmud II, after his requests for assistance had been rejected by Austria, Great Britain, and France, accepted Russian military aid early in 1833. In return he concluded, at the village of Hünkâr İskelesi, near Istanbul (Constantinople), an eight-year treaty that proclaimed peace and friendship between the two nations and a commitment to reach a mutual agreement on all matters relating to peace and security and to give each other assistance. The real significance of the treaty, however, lay in a secret article that limited Ottoman aid to Russia to the closing of the Strait of the Dardanelles to “any foreign vessels of war” except those of Russia. The treaty aroused the suspicion of other powers, particularly Great Britain; Russia abandoned the Dardanelles privileges when it signed the London Straits Convention of 1841.
