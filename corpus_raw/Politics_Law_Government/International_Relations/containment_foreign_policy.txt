Containment,   strategic foreign policy pursued by the United States beginning in the late 1940s in order to check the expansionist policy of the Soviet Union. The term was suggested by the principal framer of the policy, the U.S. diplomat  George F. Kennan, who wrote in an anonymous article in the July 1947 issue of Foreign Affairs that the United States should pursue a “long-term, patient but firm and vigilant containment of Russian expansive tendencies” in the hope that the regime would mellow or collapse. The policy was implemented in the Truman Doctrine of 1947, which guaranteed immediate economic and military aid to Greece and Turkey, and in the Eisenhower Doctrine of 1957, which promised military and economic aid to Middle Eastern countries resisting communist aggression.
