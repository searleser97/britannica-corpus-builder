Association of Caribbean States (ACS),  trading bloc composed of 25 countries of the Caribbean basin. Responding to a proposal by then U.S. Pres. Bill Clinton for a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), existing Caribbean-area trading blocs joined forces in 1995 to strengthen their economic position and ease future integration into the FTAA. Prominent in the ACS are the Caribbean Community countries, which have been struggling toward a single market and economy along the lines of the European Union. The ACS has addressed issues including unifying responses to natural disasters, ending the U.S. embargo of Cuba, and ending shipments of nuclear materials through the Panama Canal.
