United Nations Korean Reconstruction Agency (UNKRA),  economic-rehabilitation program (1950â€“58) established to aid South Korea in recovering from the disruption caused by the 1945 partition creating the two Korean republics. In addition to problems of economic reconstruction, much attention was concentrated on the problem of refugees who were displaced by World War II and those who were made homeless by the ensuing Korean War. Thirty-four UN member states and five nonmember states contributed $148,500,000 to the UNKRA program, which was terminated on July 1, 1958.
