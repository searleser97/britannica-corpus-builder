Talambo affair,   (1862), attack by Peruvian workers on Spanish Basque immigrants on the hacienda (estate) of Talambo, in northern Peru; this incident led to the Spanish war against Peru (1864–66), the last attempt by Spain to reestablish hegemony over any of its former colonies in the Americas.
Following the attack at Talambo, the Spanish government sent an investigator, whom it called a viceroy (the title of the head of the former Spanish colonial government), to Peru; the Peruvian government resented the obvious denigration of its sovereignty and refused to deal with him. In April 1864 Spain dispatched a fleet that occupied Peru’s guano-rich Chincha Islands, about 12 miles (19 km) off the Peruvian coast. The Peruvian president, Gen. Juan Antonio Pezet, acceded to Spain’s demands for an indemnity in return for the islands, but the ensuing furor among his countrymen enabled Gen. Mariano Ignacio Prado to oust him in 1865. Prado forged an alliance with Ecuador, Bolivia, and Chile and declared war against Spain in 1866; that year the South American allies defeated the Spanish fleet off Callao, Peru, thus effectively ending the Spanish intervention, although the treaty formally ending hostilities was not signed until 1879.
