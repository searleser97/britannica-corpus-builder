Institute of International Law,  international organization founded in Ghent, Belgium, in 1873 to develop and implement international law as a codified science responsible for the legal morality and integrity of the civilized world. In 1904 the Institute of International Law was awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace.
The institute’s founder, the Baron Rolin-Jacquemyns, felt that such a body was necessary for the establishment and acceptance of the concept of international law—a concept that was only beginning to form at this time and that was not universally accepted in legal circles. Rolin-Jacquemyns was elected as the group’s first secretary-general at the initial meeting in Ghent; representatives from 9 countries were present, and 24 other countries sent notice of their agreement to join.
Among the organization’s achievements were its contributions to the development of international treaties for protection of the Suez Canal and its work on the proposals of the Hague Conference. In the late 20th century the institute focused its efforts on international human rights. The institute maintains its standards as a scientific body of law, and all members are chosen from within the international legal community.
