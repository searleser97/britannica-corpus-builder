United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO),  international UN development agency, based in Vienna, that was established by the General Assembly on January 1, 1967. UNIDOâ€™s governing body, the General Conference, meets every two years and determines policy and approves the budget. It also elects the director-general and the Industrial Development Board, which is composed of representatives from 53 member states; the board reviews the various programs and makes recommendations on policy matters.
UNIDO aims to assist in the industrialization of the developing countries by coordinating other UN organizations devoted to this end. Its activities help to formulate industrial development policies and programs by providing advisers and other assistance, mostly in terms of information, education, and research. A network of Investment and Technology Promotion offices in countries such as Bahrain, China, Italy, Japan, Greece, and Russia publicize investment opportunities and provide information to potential investors. UNIDO also maintains liaison offices in Geneva and New York City and has other field offices around the world.
