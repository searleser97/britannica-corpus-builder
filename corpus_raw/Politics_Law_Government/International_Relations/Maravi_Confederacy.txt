Maravi Confederacy, also called Maravi Empire,  centralized system of government established in southern Africa about 1480. The members of the confederacy were related ethnolinguistic groups who had migrated from the north into what is now central and southern Malaŵi. The confederacy was ruled by a karonga (king), whose authority was passed down through the leaders of each clan.
The main body of the confederacy was settled in an area southwest of Lake Nyasa (Lake Malaŵi); two groups moved south into the Shire River valley during the 15th or 16th century, and other groups moved into territories now in Zambia and Mozambique. The confederacy reached its peak during the 17th century, administering a large area that stretched north of the Zambezi River to the Dwangwa River, west to the Luangwa River, and east to the Mozambique coast. Its decline began when clan leaders, who traded with the Portuguese and Arabs in ivory, slaves, and iron, became increasingly independent of the central authority of the karonga. By 1720 the confederacy had broken into several autonomous factions.
The Chewa and Nyanja peoples of modern Malaŵi are descendants of the original Maravi clans.
