Group of 20 (G20),  international body created in 1999 that provides a forum for strategic economic communication between industrialized and developing countries. The G20 originated as a response to the economic crises of the late 1990s; it expanded on the work of the Group of Seven (G7; known as the Group of Eight [G8] in its political incarnation) by including countries that previously had been left out of the global discussion. Its membership comprises 19 countries (Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and the European Union (EU). The countries are represented by finance ministers and central bank governors, while the EU is represented by the European Central Bank and a rotating council presidency. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund also participate.
Prior to the first G20 meeting, on December 15–16, 1999, similar conferences with 22 and 33 participants were held in 1998–99 with the goal of making the global economy less vulnerable to crisis. The positive effects of these dialogues drove the official development of the G20. Meetings are held annually, and each summit meeting is hosted and chaired by a different member. In addition, emergency summit meetings may be called; the body convened in November 2008 to address the dire market circumstances of that time. Held immediately after the 2015 Paris terrorist attacks, the previously scheduled G20 summit in Turkey was largely devoted to discussions of terrorism and the ongoing European refugee crisis. Other issues that have been addressed by the group include corruption, tax transparency, economic inequality, renewable energy, and sustainable development.
