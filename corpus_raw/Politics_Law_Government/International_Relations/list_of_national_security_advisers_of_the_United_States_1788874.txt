 The National Security Council (NSC) was established in 1947 to advise the U.S. president on domestic, foreign, and military policies related to national security. The NSC is headed by the national security adviser, who is appointed by the president and not subject to confirmation by the U.S. Senate. This is a chronologically ordered list of national security advisers, from the earliest to the most recent.
