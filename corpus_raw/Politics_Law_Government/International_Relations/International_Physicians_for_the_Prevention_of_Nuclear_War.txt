International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War,   international organization of doctors who are opposed to the nuclear arms race and who seek to educate the public on the catastrophic medical consequences that would result from a nuclear war. The group was awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace in 1985.
International Physicians was founded (in 1980) and led by several American and Soviet physicians under the leadership of Bernard Lown and Yevgeny I. Chazov, respectively. The organization promotes research on the medical, psychological, and biospheric effects that a nuclear war would have. At the time that it was awarded the prize, the group had more than 135,000 members in 41 countries, with about 30,000 of them in the United States and about 60,000 in the Soviet Union. International Physicians was criticized in some quarters for allegedly letting itself be drawn into the antiwar propaganda activities of the Soviet Union.
