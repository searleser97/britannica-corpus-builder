Treaty of Neuilly,  (Nov. 27, 1919), peace treaty between Bulgaria and the victorious Allied powers after World War I that became effective Aug. 9, 1920. Under its terms Bulgaria was forced to cede lands to Yugoslavia and Greece (thus depriving it of an outlet to the Aegean) involving the transfer of some 300,000 people; to reduce its army to 20,000 men; and to pay reparations, 75 percent of which were later remitted.
