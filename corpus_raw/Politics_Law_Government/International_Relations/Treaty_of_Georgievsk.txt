Treaty of Georgievsk,  (July 24, 1783), agreement concluded by Catherine II the Great of Russia and Erekle II of Kartalinia-Kakhetia (eastern Georgia) by which Russia guaranteed Georgia’s territorial integrity and the continuation of its reigning Bagratid dynasty in return for prerogatives in the conduct of Georgian foreign affairs.
Under the terms of the treaty, Catherine and her heirs were to defend Georgia against enemies, and Erekle renounced dependence upon Iran or any other power. Though the treaty was to have permanent validity, Emperor Paul I’s manifesto of Dec. 18, 1800, unilaterally declared the annexation of Kartalinia-Kakhetia to Russia, and on Sept. 12, 1801, his successor, Alexander I, formally reaffirmed this determination.
