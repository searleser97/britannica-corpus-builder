West Florida Controversy,   in U.S. history, dispute over the status of the territory lying on the Gulf of Mexico between the Apalachicola and Mississippi rivers. Though Spain claimed the area as part of its New World discovery in 1492, France occupied it as a portion of Louisiana after 1695. Under the Treaty of Paris of 1763, West Florida was held by Great Britain, which returned it to Spain under the Treaty of Paris of 1783. The United States, wishing to control the river outlets in the region, claimed the area as part of the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. In 1810 American frontiersmen in the Baton Rouge section rebelled against Spanish control, and the remainder was soon included in the Mississippi Territory. In the Transcontinental (Adams-On√≠s) Treaty of 1819, Spain ceded all claim to West Florida, which came under official U.S. jurisdiction two years later.
