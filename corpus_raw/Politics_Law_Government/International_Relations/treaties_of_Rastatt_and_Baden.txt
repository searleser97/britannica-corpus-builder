Treaties of Rastatt and Baden,  (March 6 and Sept. 7, 1714), peace treaties between the Holy Roman emperor Charles VI and France that ended the emperor’s attempt to continue the War of the Spanish Succession (1700–14) after the other states had made peace in the Treaties of Utrecht (beginning in 1713).
Charles VI made peace in his own name at Rastatt and in the name of the states of the Holy Roman Empire half a year later at Baden in Switzerland. In these treaties Charles renounced his claims to the Spanish throne but did not actually make peace with Spain and did not recognize the Bourbon Philip V as king of Spain. A technical state of war with Spain existed until 1720.
The emperor was recognized by France as the ruler of the former Spanish possessions of Milan, Tuscany, Naples, the Southern Netherlands, and Sardinia. The emperor recovered Breisach, Kehl, and Freiburg east of the Rhine; in return he ceded Strasbourg and Alsace to France and agreed to allow France’s allies, the electors of Bavaria and Cologne, to recover their possessions. This settlement, like the final treaties of the general settlement of Utrecht, became part of the foundation of international relations in Europe for the next generation.
