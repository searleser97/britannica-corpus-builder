Convention of Wadgaon,  (Jan. 13, 1779), compact concluded after the First Maratha War in India (1775â€“82), marking the end of British efforts to intervene in Maratha affairs by making Raghunath Rao peshwa (the nominal leader of the Maratha confederacy) or at least regent for his infant great-nephew.
The compact was concluded after a British expedition, commanded by Col. William Cockburn and controlled by Col. John Carnac, was surrounded by Maratha forces at Wadgaon, 23 miles (37 km) from Poona (Pune), and forced to come to terms. The terms included the return of all British annexations of Maratha territory since 1773, including Salsette Island; the halting of a British force marching from Bengal; and a share of the revenues from the district of Broach (Bharuch) for the Maratha chief Sindhia. The terms were disavowed by the British authorities at Bengal, and the First Maratha War dragged on until 1782, ending with the British abandonment of Raghunath and retention of Salsette.
