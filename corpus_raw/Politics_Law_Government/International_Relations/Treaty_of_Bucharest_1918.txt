Treaty of Bucharest,  (May 7, 1918), settlement forced upon Romania after it had been defeated by the Central Powers during World War I. According to the terms of the treaty, Romania had to return southern Dobruja to Bulgaria, give Austria-Hungary control of the passes in the Carpathian Mountains, and lease its oil wells to Germany for 90 years. When the Central Powers collapsed in November, the Treaty of Bucharest was nullified.
