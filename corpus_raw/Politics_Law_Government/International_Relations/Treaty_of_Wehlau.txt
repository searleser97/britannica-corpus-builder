Treaty of Wehlau,  Wehlau also spelled Welawa,  (Sept. 19, 1657), agreement in which John Casimir, king of Poland from 1648 to 1668, renounced the suzerainty of the Polish crown over ducal Prussia and made Frederick William, who was the duke of Prussia as well as the elector of Brandenburg (1640–88), the duchy’s sovereign ruler.
The electors of Brandenburg had inherited the duchy from the last grand master of the Teutonic Knights as a Polish fief. Frederick William’s participation in the Polish-Swedish War of Succession (1600–60) was aimed at acquiring it in his own right. At first, he sided with Sweden, but, when that failed to secure his objective, he concluded the Treaty of Wehlau with John Casimir, king of Poland. According to the treaty, Frederick William promised to provide Poland with 6,000 troops from Brandenburg for use against Sweden. In return, John Casimir recognized Frederick William and his heirs as sovereign rulers of ducal Prussia. The provisions of the Treaty of Wehlau were later confirmed by the Treaty of Oliva (1660), which concluded the Polish-Swedish War.
