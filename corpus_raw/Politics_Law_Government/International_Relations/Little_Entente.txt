Little Entente,   mutual defense arrangement among Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Romania during the period between World Wars I and II. Based on several treaties (1920–21), it was directed against German and Hungarian domination in the Danube River basin and toward the protection of the members’ territorial integrity and political independence. During the 1920s the three nations sought economic and political cooperation and negotiated alliances with France.
After Adolf Hitler assumed power in Germany (1933), the members of the Little Entente created a Permanent Secretariat and a Permanent Council, composed of their foreign ministers, that met three times a year to direct a common policy. Nevertheless, during the 1930s the three states increasingly adopted independent foreign policies, especially after Germany occupied the Rhineland (1936) and the French support, upon which the entente relied, lost much of its value. 
The entente lost its remaining political significance when Yugoslavia and Romania denied (April 1937) a request by Czechoslovakia, then threatened by Germany, that the entente pledge full military aid to a member that was the victim of aggression. The entente finally collapsed when Germany annexed the Sudeten area of Czechoslovakia (September 1938).
