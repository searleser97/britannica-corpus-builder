Organisation for European Economic Co-operation,  organization set up by a convention signed in Paris in April 1948 to coordinate efforts to restore Europeâ€™s economy under the European Recovery Program (Marshall Plan). Among its many functions, the OEEC helped abolish quantitative trade restrictions between its member countries, allocated scarce resources among them, and devised a system for regular consultation on matters of common economic concern. In 1961 it was superseded by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which included non-European members. See Economic Co-operation and Development, Organisation for.
