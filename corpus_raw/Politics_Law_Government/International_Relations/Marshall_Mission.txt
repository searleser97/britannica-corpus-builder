Marshall Mission,  special mission undertaken in late 1945 by U.S. general George C. Marshall to negotiate a settlement of the Chinese civil war (1945–49), fought between the Nationalist and the communist forces. Though Marshall stayed in China for more than a year, his mission ended in failure.
Marshall’s dispatch to China by U.S. president Harry S. Truman in December 1945 came at a time when U.S.-sponsored negotiations between Chiang Kai-shek, the Nationalist president of China, and Mao Zedong, the leader of the communists, had broken down, and civil war seemed imminent. The appointment of the distinguished World War II chief of staff Marshall as a special presidential ambassador forced the two enemies to enter into serious negotiations once again. By Jan. 10, 1946, both sides had agreed to an immediate cease-fire and the convocation of a Political Consultative Conference that would negotiate the eventual composition of the coalition government, through which both sides could jointly rule China. On February 25 a proposal was concluded for the joint reduction of the two armies, based on a 5 to 1 ratio of Nationalist troops to communists.
By spring, however, the truce between the two sides had collapsed. Fighting began first in northeastern China (Manchuria)—a region that contained China’s major industrial base by the end of the Japanese occupation of it in 1945—as Soviet troops, who in the course of accepting the Japanese surrender had temporarily occupied Manchuria, evacuated and plundered the area. Marshall was recalled from China in January 1947.
