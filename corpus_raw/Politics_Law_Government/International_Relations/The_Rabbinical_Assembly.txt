The Rabbinical Assembly,  organization of Conservative rabbis in the United States, Canada, Latin America, Europe, and Israel. It was founded in 1900 as the Alumni Association of the Jewish Theological Seminary and was reorganized in 1940 as the Rabbinical Assembly of America; in 1962 it acquired its present name and international scope. The Rabbinical Assembly recommends rabbis for appointment to Conservative congregations and promotes the goals of Conservative Judaism. In 1985 the Rabbinical Assembly voted to allow the admittance of women as rabbis for the first time. Its publications include the quarterly Conservative Judaism and several prayer books.
