Treaty of Novgorod,  (June 3, 1326), the peace treaty ending decades of hostilities between the principality of Novgorod (now in Russia) and Norway. The conflicts took place in what was then generally known as Finnmark (including the present Norwegian province of Finnmark and Russia’s Kola Peninsula). The treaty, rather than delimiting a clear frontier between Norway and Novgorod, created a buffer zone, the “common districts.” The buffer zone offered Norway and Novgorod taxing rights over the indigenous Sami and freedom to exploit the fish and fur of the region. This arrangement remained in effect until the present Norwegian-Russian frontier was established in 1826.
