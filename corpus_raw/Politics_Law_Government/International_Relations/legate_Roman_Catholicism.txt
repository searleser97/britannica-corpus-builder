Legate, also called Papal Legate,  in the Roman Catholic Church, a cleric sent on a mission, ecclesiastical or diplomatic, by the pope as his personal representative. Three types of legates are recognized by canon law. A legatus a latere (a legate sent from the popeâ€™s side, as it were) is a cardinal who represents the pope on some special assignment with such powers as are delegated to him. Nuncios, pronuncios, and internuncios are sent to countries that have diplomatic relations with the Holy See; they promote friendly relations and observe and report to the pope on the state of the church in that region. Apostolic delegates are prelates who are appointed by the pope as his representatives to the church of a region. They channel information between the local ecclesiastical hierarchy and the Holy See.
