Itata and Baltimore incidents,   (1891), two serious occurrences involving the United States and Chile, the first taking place during and the second shortly after the Chilean civil war of 1891.
The civil war was precipitated by a conflict between the Chilean Congress and President José Manuel Balmaceda, in which the navy supported the insurgent Congress and the army backed the president. The U.S. government openly favoured Balmaceda. The rebels, faced with a shortage of arms, purchased some in San Diego, Calif., and loaded them on the Chilean ship Itata. U.S. officials, claiming that the purchase violated their country’s neutrality, attempted unsuccessfully to prevent the ship from sailing. On the Itata’s arrival in Chile the revolutionaries were forced to hand the ship over to U.S. naval custody. The Itata was escorted back to the United States, where a court ruled that there had been no violation of U.S. neutrality and that the detention of the ship had been improper. The incident aroused the intense anger of the Chilean insurgents, and, after they had gained control of the government, U.S.-Chilean relations entered a long period of tension that was further aggravated by the incident involving the cruiser USS Baltimore.
In August 1891 Balmaceda resigned and gained asylum in the Argentine legation, after forces loyal to him had suffered two defeats near Valparaíso. The U.S. minister to Chile then gave political asylum to some of Balmaceda’s supporters. Animosity toward North Americans boiled over on Oct. 16, 1891, when the captain of the Baltimore injudiciously allowed his men shore leave at Valparaíso. Some of the crew members were attacked by a mob; two were killed and several wounded seriously. War was averted when the Chilean government, while maintaining that the seamen were to blame, offered to pay an indemnity of $75,000 to their families.
