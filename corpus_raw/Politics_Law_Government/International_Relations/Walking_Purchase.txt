Walking Purchase,   (Aug. 25, 1737), land swindle perpetrated by Pennsylvania authorities on the Delaware Indians, who had been the tribe most friendly to William Penn when he founded the colony in the previous century. Colonial authorities claimed to have found a lost treaty, of 1686, ceding a tract of Delaware tribal land between the fork of the Delaware and Lehigh rivers that extended as far as a man could walk in 1 1/2 days—about 40 miles. William Penn’s son Thomas Penn (1702–75), who was proprietor of Pennsylvania in 1737, hired the three fastest walkers in the colony and offered a large prize to the one who could cover the most land. The winner, running on a carefully cleared path, crossed more than twice the land the Delaware had anticipated—causing the tribe to lose about 1,200 square miles (3,100 square km) of their land. At Thomas Penn’s request, members of the Iroquois Confederacy helped enforce this unpopular decision. In reaction to this and other frauds, the Delaware joined the French in the Ohio country and returned to ravage the Pennsylvania frontier during the last French and Indian War (1756–63). In 1758 the northern half of the purchase was relinquished to the Iroquois Confederacy; the Delaware received £400 in compensation for it four years later.
