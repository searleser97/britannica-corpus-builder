Kruger telegram,  (Jan. 3, 1896), a message sent by Emperor William II of Germany to Pres. Paul Kruger of the South African Republic (or the Transvaal), congratulating him on repelling the Jameson Raid, an attack on the Transvaal from the British-controlled Cape Colony. The telegram was interpreted in the Transvaal as a sign of possible German support in the future. Williamâ€™s intention was to demonstrate to the British that they were diplomatically isolated and should become friendly with Germany. This proved to be a diplomatic and psychological blunder. Instead, the telegram aroused the first wave of popular hostility against Germany in Britain in the pre-World War I period, and it is considered by many to have been an early incident in the series of escalations that led to World War I.
