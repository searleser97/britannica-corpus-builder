Balkan League,   (1866–68), an alliance organized by the Serbian prince Michael III (Mihailo Obrenović). Concluded by the governments of Serbia, Romania, Montenegro, and Greece and a Bulgarian revolutionary society, it tried to drive the Turks from the Balkans and to unite the South Slavs in a single state. The league planned a coordinated rebellion against the Turks, but the assassination of Prince Michael (June 10, 1868) derailed the plans and destroyed the league.
