YMCA, in full Young Men’s Christian Association,  nonsectarian, nonpolitical Christian lay movement that aims to develop high standards of Christian character through group activities and citizenship training. It originated in London in 1844, when 12 young men, led by George Williams, an employee in, and subsequently the head of, a drapery house, formed a club for the “improvement of the spiritual condition of young men in the drapery and other trades.” Similar clubs spread rapidly in the United Kingdom and reached Australia in 1850 and North America in 1851, where the organization eventually reached its greatest development. The first club in North America was founded in Montreal, the second in Boston.
YMCA programs include sports and physical education, camping, counseling, formal and informal education, public affairs, and citizenship activities. Among other activities, the YMCA sponsors hotels, residence halls, and cafeterias. In the United States it operates several degree-granting institutions as well as many other schools at all levels, including night classes for adults. In 2010 the U.S. movement changed its name to “the Y,” though specific branches continued to use YMCA in their name.
The YMCA began providing service to the armed forces, in the United States, during the Civil War, and it continued giving service through all wars thereafter. By the Geneva Convention of 1929, it was charged with promoting educational and recreational facilities in many prisoner-of-war camps.
Local YMCA organizations are affiliated with national councils, which in turn are members of the World Alliance of YMCAs, established in 1855 with headquarters in Geneva. At the centennial of the World Alliance in 1955, a series of conferences held in Paris was attended by 8,000 delegates representing more than 4 million members in 76 countries and territories. By the early 21st century, the YMCA had expanded to more than 45 million members in some 125 countries and territories.
