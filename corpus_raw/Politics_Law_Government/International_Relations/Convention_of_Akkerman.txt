Convention of Akkerman,  (Oct. 7, 1826), agreement signed in Akkerman, Moldavia (now Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyy, Ukraine), between the Ottoman Empire and Russia, whereby the Ottomans accepted, under threat of war, Russia’s demands concerning Serbia and the Danube principalities of Moldavia and Walachia.
The convention confirmed the signers’ earlier Treaty of Bucharest (1812); recognized the autonomy of Serbia; granted Russia special rights to protect the autonomy of Moldavia and Walachia, including a seven-year term of office for the hospodars (princes), who could thenceforth not be dismissed without consent of the Russian ambassador in Istanbul; allowed Russian ships freedom of the Black Sea and the Danube River; and opened the Straits of the Bosporus and the Dardanelles to merchant vessels of any nation sailing to or from Russia. Subsequent Ottoman renunciation of the Convention of Akkerman and attempts to regain control of Serbia, Moldavia, and Walachia resulted in a Russian declaration of war against the Ottoman Empire in 1828.
