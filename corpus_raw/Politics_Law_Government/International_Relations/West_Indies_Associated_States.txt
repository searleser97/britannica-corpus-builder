West Indies Associated States,  former political organization of islands in the Caribbean Sea that were British colonies whose status changed to free association with the United Kingdom in 1967. This status provided for internal self-government, with Britain responsible for external affairs and defense. The islands attempted several kinds of federation between 1958 and 1966 (see Leeward Islands), but the impetus toward political independence and traditional interisland rivalries proved too strong for a colonial federation to be viable.
The original membership of the West Indies Associated States consisted of Antigua, Dominica, Grenada, Montserrat, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent. These states participated in the West Indies (Associated States) Council of Ministers and the East Caribbean Common Market and Caribbean Free Trade Association, both now superseded by the Caribbean Community and Common Market (Caricom). As the states gradually moved toward independence in the late 1970s and early â€™80s, the need for a different regional organization was recognized, and the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States was formally established in 1981. By the early 1980s all the former associated states had achieved independence except Montserrat, which remains a British dependency.
