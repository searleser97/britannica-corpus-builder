United Nations Development Programme (UNDP),  United Nations (UN) organization formed in 1965 to help countries eliminate poverty and achieve sustainable human development, an approach to economic growth that emphasizes improving the quality of life of all citizens while conserving the environment and natural resources for future generations. The largest UN development assistance program, the UNDP is headed by an administrator who oversees a 36-member Executive Board representing both developing and developed countries. It is headquartered in New York City.
The UNDP administers aid through five-year Country Programmes, which fund projects aimed at attracting investment capital, training skilled employees, and implementing modern technologies. The UNDP also makes experts available to help developing countries increase their capacity for good governance—by building political and legal institutions that are equitable, responsive, and open to public participation—and to expand the private sector of their economies in order to provide more jobs. Recent UNDP programs have focused on reducing poverty, developing strategies to treat and combat the spread of HIV/AIDS, promoting environmentally sound energy and economic policies, and expanding communications and technology infrastructure. UNDP resident representatives in more than 125 developing countries help to coordinate the local activities of other UN agencies and programs, as well as those of nongovernmental organizations.
