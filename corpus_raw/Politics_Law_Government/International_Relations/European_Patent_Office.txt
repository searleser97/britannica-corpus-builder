European Patent Office (EPO),  executive branch of the European Patent Organisation, the international organization that issues European patents. The European Patent Organisation was created by the European Patent Convention, which was signed by 16 European countries in Munich on Oct. 5, 1973, and came into force on Oct. 7, 1977. The EPO is supervised by the Administrative Council, the legislative branch of the European Patent Organisation, and governed by a management committee headed by a president. The EPO accepted the first patent applications in June 1978 and granted the first patents two years later; by 2006 more than 1.2 million applications had been filed. It is headquartered in Munich and has offices in Berlin, The Hague, Vienna, and Brussels.
The mission of the EPO is to encourage innovation worldwide, promote competitiveness, and support the economic growth of its member countries. In addition to conducting searches and examinations on European patent applications, the EPO examines opposition to granted patents, sets European patent-protection standards, and makes current patent information available to the public. The organization also has several boards of appeal that hear objections to the decisions made by its receiving, examining, opposition, and legal divisions. The EPOâ€™s publications include guides for applicants, newsletters, annual reports, and official periodicals.
