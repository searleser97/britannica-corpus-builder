Quadruple Alliance,   alliance first formed in 1813, during the final phase of the Napoleonic Wars, by Britain, Russia, Austria, and Prussia, for the purpose of defeating Napoleon, but conventionally dated from Nov. 20, 1815, when it was officially renewed to prevent recurrence of French aggression and to provide machinery to enforce the peace settlement concluded at the Congress of Vienna. The members each agreed to put 60,000 men in the field in the event of French aggression. More significantly, they agreed to meet occasionally to confer on European problems and to keep European political development within terms of the 1815 settlement. This program was partially carried out by the congresses of Aix-la-Chapelle, Troppau, Laibach, and Verona. At the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (Aachen, 1818) France was admitted to full participation in the proceedings, creating in effect the Quintuple Alliance.
Although the old alliance was secretly renewed on Nov. 1, 1818, because of some continued fear of France, there was never an occasion for the alliance to oppose France, and it remained inactive. British foreign policy diverged from that of the other powers in the 1820s, weakening the efforts of the Austrian prince Klemens von Metternich to use the alliance for reaction and counterrevolution throughout Europe.
