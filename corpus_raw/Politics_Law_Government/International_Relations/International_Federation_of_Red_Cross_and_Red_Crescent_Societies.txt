International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies,, original name League of Red Cross Societies, also called (1983–91) League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies,  international organization responsible for encouraging the formation of and aiding national Red Cross and Red Crescent societies. The federation shared the Nobel Prize for Peace with the International Committee of the Red Cross in 1963; at the time its name was the League of Red Cross Societies.
The league was founded in 1919 in response to the immense scope of activities by various national Red Cross societies; an organization was needed to serve as a liaison between the societies so that they could work together. In 1983 this organization’s name was changed to the League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in response to the use of Red Crescent in Muslim countries. The name was changed again, in 1991, to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.
The main goal of the federation is to facilitate the humanitarian activities of national Red Cross and Red Crescent societies in non-conflict areas; the organization thus focuses its efforts on victims of natural and man-made disasters such as famine or hurricanes. The federation also encourages and assists nations to establish Red Cross and Red Crescent societies.
