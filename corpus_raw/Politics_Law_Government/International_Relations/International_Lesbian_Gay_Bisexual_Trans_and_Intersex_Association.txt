International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA), formerly (1978–2008) International Lesbian and Gay Association,  worldwide federation of individuals and nonprofit organizations seeking to protect the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual, and intersexual persons and to raise awareness of both legal and illegal discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. ILGA was founded as the International Lesbian and Gay Association in 1978 and adopted its current name in 2008. By the early 21st century ILGA had grown to include more than 1,600 member organizations from more than 150 countries and territories. Headquarters are in Geneva.
Specific issues addressed by ILGA include adoption, age-of-consent laws, legal discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS, hate crimes, and same-sex marriage. The group publishes world maps showing countries in which homosexual acts are legally prohibited, including those in which such acts are punishable by death, and it issues regular reports on countries that maintain laws against homosexuality. Additionally, ILGA takes an active role in rebutting the idea that pedophilia and homosexuality are linked, and it regularly publicizes legal cases from around the world in which people are sentenced for homosexual practices.
ILGA is managed by an executive board that is elected at the ILGA’s World Conference, which is convened every one or two years. Six world regions are represented in ILGA: Africa; Australia, New Zealand, and the Pacific islands; Asia; Europe; Latin America and the Caribbean; and North America. Two members, including one member who identifies as a woman, are chosen from each region for the executive board. ILGA is funded through membership fees.
