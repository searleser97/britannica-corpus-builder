International Peace Bureau,, in full Permanent International Peace Bureau,  international organization founded in 1891 in Bern, Switz., to create a central office through which peace activities of several countries could be coordinated. The Peace Bureau was awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace in 1910, after having been nominated during 7 of the first 10 years of the history of the prize. In the years after its recognition by the Nobel Committee, however, the effectiveness of the Peace Bureau declined greatly.
The organization was established by members of the third World Peace Congress in Rome in 1891 after lobbying by Fredrik Bajer, Hodgson Pratt, and Charles Lemonnier. The aims of the organization were outlined as: serving as a link between pacifists from around the world, providing information on the peace movement, and preparing for and implementing resolutions of the World Peace Congresses. In its early years the organization fulfilled these goals and served as the major voice of the peace movement. The Peace Bureau regularly issued appeals for peace to any parties participating in or threatening war; however, this tactic was rather unsuccessful.
With the establishment of the League of Nations and other international government and peace organizations after World War I, the Peace Bureau became less important and eventually suspended its activities during World War II. The Swiss court officially terminated the organization in 1959, giving all the bureau’s assets to the International Liaison Committee of Organizations for Peace (ILCOP). Attempting to revive the former peace organization, ILCOP named its Geneva secretariat the International Peace Bureau. Although it was recognized by the Nobel Committee, the new bureau did not share the status of the former as the voice of the world’s pacifists.
