Treaty of Verdun,  (August 843), treaty partitioning the Carolingian empire among the three surviving sons of the emperor Louis I (the Pious). The treaty was the first stage in the dissolution of the empire of Charlemagne and foreshadowed the formation of the modern countries of western Europe. Louis I had carefully planned his three elder sons’ inheritances, but from 829 onward his attempts to allocate substantial territory to the future Charles II (the Bald), his young son by a second wife, led to revolts by Charles’s half brothers. After Louis’s death (840) open warfare broke out; Louis’s third son, Louis the German, allied with Charles in attacking the eldest son, the emperor Lothar I. Defeated at Fontenoy, in present Belgium (June 841), and driven from Aix-la-Chapelle (Aachen, Ger., 842), Lothar sued for peace. At Verdun (in present northeastern France) the following year, Lothar was confirmed in possession of the imperial title and received Francia Media, a long central strip of territory including parts of modern Belgium, the Netherlands, western Germany, eastern France, Switzerland, and much of Italy. Louis the German received Francia Orientalis, the land east of the Rhine River. Charles received Francia Occidentalis, the remainder of modern France.
