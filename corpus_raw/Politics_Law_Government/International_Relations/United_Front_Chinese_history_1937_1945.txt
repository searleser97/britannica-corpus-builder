United Front,  in modern Chinese history, either of two coalitions between the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the Nationalist Party (Kuomintang [KMT]).
The first United Front was begun in 1924. In return for Soviet military and organizational aid, Sun Yat-sen (Sun Zhongshan), the leader of the KMT, agreed to a “bloc within” alliance in which CCP members joined the KMT as individuals while retaining their separate CCP memberships. The alliance was held together by the personal prestige of Sun. After Sun’s death, in 1925, tension began to develop between the right wing of the KMT and the communists. Finally, in March 1926, Chiang Kai-shek (Jiang Jieshi), who had been made commander in chief of the KMT army, expelled the communists from positions of high leadership. A short time later, Chiang began his Northern Expedition to eliminate the powerful provincial warlords among whom the country was divided. The Northern Expedition met with success, and, as a result, Chiang gained the support of financial circles in Shanghai and of a number of warlords, whose armies were incorporated into his. In April 1927 Chiang began a bloody purge of all communists in areas under his control. The communist labour movement, which had been instrumental in aiding Chiang in the capture of the large South China cities, was almost entirely destroyed. The left wing of the KMT, which had already established an independent regime in Wuhan, in central China, continued to support the communists, but the Wuhan regime’s military situation became untenable, and friction developed between the communists and the KMT left wing. In July 1927 they dissolved their alliance, officially ending the first United Front.
Communist remnants fled to the countryside, where they began to organize the peasantry and established several independent “soviets” in rural areas. However, under continued pressure from KMT troops, the communists embarked on the Long March (1934–36). They eventually reached northwestern China, which was closer to the area that by then was occupied by Japanese troops. Led by Mao Zedong, the communists responded to the growing anti-Japanese sentiment of their countrymen by calling on the KMT to join with them in expelling the Japanese. Chiang at first ignored these pleas; however, he was forced to change his attitude after the Xi’an Incident (December 1936), when he was kidnapped and held captive by troops of the warlords Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng, who wanted the KMT to fight the Japanese, not the communists. Chiang was compelled, not only by his personal situation but by the pressure of events in general, to agree to the warlords’ demands.
Thus, in 1937 the second United Front between the KMT and the communists was formally established, this time on the basis of a “bloc without” alliance between two separate groups; the communists reorganized their army as the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army and put them nominally under KMT direction. In the fighting against the Japanese, however, the regular KMT armies either were crushed or were ordered to retreat. Afraid of high casualty rates, Chiang pulled his best troops off the front lines as early as 1939. Communist guerrillas, who mobilized the population behind the Japanese lines, soon became the only forces still fighting the Japanese. Worried about the resulting growth in communist strength, the KMT began to use their troops to blockade communist positions, several times even fighting against them. The United Front, however, continued officially until 1945, when, at the end of World War II, talks on unification between the two sides broke down, and a full-scale civil war ensued between the communists and the KMT.
