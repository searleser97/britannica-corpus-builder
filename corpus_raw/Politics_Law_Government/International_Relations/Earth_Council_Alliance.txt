Earth Council Alliance (ECA),  network of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and individuals dedicated to promoting sustainable development. The Earth Council Alliance specifically supports the sustainability goals articulated in three documents: the Earth Charter, an international declaration drafted in 1997–99 and since endorsed by thousands of organizations and many governments; Agenda 21, a program for global economic development adopted at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (the Earth Summit) in 1992; and the United Nations Development Programme’s Millennium Development Goals, adopted in 2000. The ECA was incorporated in Geneva and has offices in San Diego and Beijing.
The ECA originated in the Earth Council, an international organization founded in 1992 by Canadian businessman and diplomat Maurice Strong, who served as secretary-general of the Earth Summit. Dedicated to implementing the principles of Agenda 21, the Earth Council from 1992 to 1998 organized more than 80 national councils for sustainable development. In the early 21st century, Strong and American philanthropist Tommy Short created the Earth Council Alliance to facilitate the work of the national councils and of allied environmental organizations and activists. To accomplish its goals, ECA supports initiatives and sponsors grassroots events such as World Environment Day.
