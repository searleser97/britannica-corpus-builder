Sun-Joffe Manifesto,   (Jan. 26, 1923), joint statement issued at Shanghai by the Chinese Nationalist revolutionary leader Sun Yat-sen and Adolf Joffe, representative of the Soviet Foreign Ministry, which provided the basis for cooperation between the Soviet Union and Sun’s Kuomintang, or Nationalist, Party.
In the negotiations that led to the signing of the manifesto, Sun agreed to the formation of a United Front between the small Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang. The Communists were to retain their Communist Party membership but would join the Kuomintang as individuals, thus constituting a “bloc within” the party. In return, the Soviet Union pledged military and political aid to the Kuomintang.
The Soviets were convinced that a bourgeois democratic revolution must occur in China before the country could be ready for socialism and that the occurrence of a bourgeois revolution in China would lead to the destruction of Western imperialism and thus would severely weaken the capitalist system. In the manifesto, therefore, Joffe agreed that the Soviets would support Sun’s program to reunify China and would renegotiate the unequal treaties forced on China by imperial Russia. Sun, however, agreed to a continued Russian presence in Outer Mongolia and to a recognition of Soviet rights to the Chinese Eastern Railway, which ran across Manchuria (Northeast Provinces) and connected Siberia with the Soviet warm-water port of Vladivostok.
Sun appointed his assistant Liao Chung-k’ai to accompany Joffe to Japan and to learn more about the Soviet system from him. Another assistant, Chiang Kai-shek, was sent to Moscow to study with Leon Trotsky and learn Soviet methods of military organization.
