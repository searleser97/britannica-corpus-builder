Bidlack Treaty, also called New Granada Treaty,   (Dec. 12, 1846), pact signed by New Granada (now Colombia and Panama) and the United States, which granted the U.S. a right-of-way across the Isthmus of Panama in exchange for a U.S. guarantee of neutrality for the isthmus and the sovereignty of New Granada thereafter. The treaty was named for the U.S. chargé d’affaires in New Granada, Benjamin Alden Bidlack. The threat of British intrusion on the coast of Central America had shown the need for such a pact.
After gold was discovered in California in 1848, a U.S. company began to construct a transisthmian railroad, which was completed in 1855. Thereafter, U.S. influence in the region increased because the Colombian government often called upon the United States to prevent closing of the isthmus route during civil wars. In 1902 the U.S. Congress authorized the president to spend $40,000,000 to obtain rights held by the French New Panama Canal Co. for building a canal. The act stipulated that Colombia concede a strip of territory across the isthmus “within a reasonable time”; in the event that Colombia refused to make such a concession, the president was permitted to negotiate with Nicaragua for a right-of-way across its territory. Accordingly, Pres. Theodore Roosevelt bought the French company’s rights, and in 1903 the Hay–Herrán Treaty was concluded between the United States and Colombia. The Colombian senate, however, withheld ratification to secure better terms. Thereupon the U.S. government engineered the secession of Panama from Colombia and then reached an agreement (Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty) with the new Republic of Panama, by which Panama became a U.S. protectorate and the U.S. government gained exclusive control of the Panama Canal Zone and permission to construct a canal. See also Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty.
