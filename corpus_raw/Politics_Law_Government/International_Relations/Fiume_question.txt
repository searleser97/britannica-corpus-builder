Fiume question,   post-World War I controversy between Italy and Yugoslavia over the control of the Adriatic port of Fiume (known in Croatia as Rijeka; q.v.).
Although the secret Treaty of London (April 26, 1915) had assigned Fiume to Yugoslavia, the Italians claimed it at the Paris Peace Conference on the principle of self-determination. Ignoring the suburb of Susak, which had 11,000 Yugoslavs and 1,500 Italians, they claimed that the rest of Fiume had 22,488 Italians against 13,351 Yugoslavs and certain others. On Sept. 12. 1919, the Italian nationalist poet Gabriele D’Annunzio, who had mustered a body of men near Trieste, occupied Fiume and proclaimed himself the “commandant” of the “Reggenza Italiana del Carnaro.” The Italian government, however, on concluding the Treaty of Rapallo (Nov. 12, 1920) with Yugoslavia, resolved to turn D’Annunzio out of Fiume. Giovanni Giolitti, the Italian premier, ordered the battleship “Andrea Doria” to shell D’Annunzio’s palace only, predicting that the surprise would cause the “commandant” to escape at once—as indeed it did. Riccardo Zanella, the next premier, supported Count Carlo Sforza’s solution of the problem, namely a free state of Fiume-Rijeka with an Italo-Fiuman-Yugoslav consortium for the port; and such a solution was approved by the Fiuman electorate on April 24, 1921. But when the Fascists gained power in Italy, the Rapallo Plan for a free state came to nothing. Pressed by Benito Mussolini, the Yugoslav government yielded, and a new Italo-Yugoslav treaty, signed in Rome on Jan. 27, 1924, recognized Fiume itself as Italian while Susak became Yugoslav.
After World War II, by the Treaty of Paris (Feb. 10, 1947), all of Fiume became part of Yugoslavia.
