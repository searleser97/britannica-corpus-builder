Twentieth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union,   (Feb. 14–25, 1956), event notable as the first stage of First Secretary Nikita S. Khrushchev’s program to repudiate Stalinism in the Soviet Union.
Highlighting the Twentieth Congress were two addresses given by Khrushchev: the famous secret speech denouncing the late Soviet leader Joseph Stalin (February 24–25), and his Report of the Central Committee to the Congress (February 14). The Report, nearly as important a document as the secret speech, announced a new line in Soviet foreign policy. Rejecting the notion that war between East and West was “fatalistically inevitable,” Khrushchev declared that “the Leninist principle of coexistence of states with different social systems” was the basis of the foreign policy of the U.S.S.R. Khrushchev also used the Twentieth Congress to consolidate his leadership by promoting persons loyal to him to high party office. The congress newly elected 40 percent of the full and candidate members of the Central Committee, and five new candidate members were added to the Presidium. Thus, by the end of the congress, Khrushchev had successfully launched his drive to wrest control of the party from the Stalinist old guard and to discredit the excesses of Stalin’s rule.
