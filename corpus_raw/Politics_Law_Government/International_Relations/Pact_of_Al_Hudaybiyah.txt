Pact of Al-Ḥudaybiyah,  (628), compromise that was reached between Muḥammad and Meccan leaders, in which Mecca gave political and religious recognition to the growing community of Muslims in Medina. Muḥammad had been approaching Mecca with approximately 1,400 followers in order to perform the ʿumrah (pilgrimage) as directed in a dream. The Meccans, however, humiliated by their inability to besiege Medina (March 627), would not allow Muḥammad entry into their city. Instead, a Meccan delegation met the Muslims at their stopping place, Al-Ḥudaybiyah, situated about 9 miles (14.5 km) outside Mecca, to negotiate a treaty, thereby acknowledging the equality of the Muslims as bargaining partners. A 10-year truce was declared. Muḥammad then agreed to abandon his ʿumrah, on the condition that he be allowed to enter Mecca the following year, at which time the city would be emptied for three days to allow the Muslims to perform their rites. In addition, provision was made for the return of any Meccan who might flee to Medina without permission from his guardian (although a similar provision for Muslims going to Mecca was not stipulated). Finally, the various tribes could ally themselves with either the Meccans or the Muslims, as they wished.
