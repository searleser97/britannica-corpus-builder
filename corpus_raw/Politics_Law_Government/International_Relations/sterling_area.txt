Sterling area,   formerly, a group of countries that kept most of their exchange reserves at the Bank of England and, in return, had access to the London capital and money market. After the devaluation of the pound sterling in September 1931, the United Kingdom and other countries that continued to maintain parity with sterling and to hold their reserves in London became known as the sterling bloc.
When World War II brought exchange control and prospective exchange shortages, particularly of dollars, the countries with the closest ties to London adopted parallel policies of monetary collaboration. In the late 1950s sterling convertibility was gradually restored, but the United Kingdom maintained restrictions on all long-term foreign investment except in the overseas sterling area. Recurring financial crises in the 1960s caused these restrictions to be tightened, the overseas sterling-area countries still continuing to receive preferential treatment.
In the late 1960s, besides the United Kingdom and its few remaining dependencies and protectorates, the sterling area consisted mainly of countries then or formerly part of the Commonwealth. Canada was not a member, but Australia and New Zealand were, together with more than a score of other nations. After Britain joined the European Economic Community in 1973, however, the sterling area drastically contracted.
Sterling-area exchange guarantees were phased out in the following years, in the wake of the adoption of floating exchange rates by the United Kingdom and other leading trading nations. The last vestiges of sterling exchange controls were ended in 1980, and the sterling area ceased to exist.
