Intergovernmental Committee on Refugees (IGCR or ICR),  agency created in 1938 on the initiative of U.S. Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt to administer intergovernmental efforts to resettle refugees from Nazi Germany and to prepare for the resettlement of future German emigrants, thus originating planned resettlement of refugees. The IGCR was directed from 1939 by Sir Herbert Emerson, who also served as the League of Nations high commissioner, and was financed by member contributions. Its work was expanded in 1943 to cover all European refugees. The IGCR was terminated in 1947 when its activities were taken over by the International Refugee Organization, a special agency of the United Nations.
