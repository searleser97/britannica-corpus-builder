Human Rights Watch, formerly (1978–88) Helsinki Watch,  international nongovernmental organization that investigates and documents human rights violations and advocates for policies to prevent such abuses. Founded in 1978 as Helsinki Watch to monitor the Soviet Union’s adherence to the Helsinki Accords, the group subsequently expanded in size and scope. It adopted its current name in 1988. Its headquarters are in New York City.
Human Rights Watch conducts fact-finding investigations of human rights abuses and monitors various countries to ensure they are not in violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948), which outlines fundamental civil, social, and political rights. An annual journal, World Report, presents a summary of the world’s current human rights situation. The group uses the media coverage generated by its report to hold human rights abusers accountable for their actions and to pressure them to reform. Related causes taken up by the group have included abortion rights, gay rights, child labour, war crimes, and human trafficking. The group has played a significant role in successful campaigns by other human rights organizations, including the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers and the International Campaign to Ban Landmines.
