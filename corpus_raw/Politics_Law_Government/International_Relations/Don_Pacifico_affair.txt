Don Pacifico Affair,   (1850), a quarrel between Great Britain and Greece, in which British acts antagonized France and Russia and caused controversy at home.
David Pacifico (known as Don Pacifico) was a Portuguese Jew who, having been born in Gibraltar in 1784, was a British subject. After serving as Portuguese consul in Morocco (1835–37) and then as consul-general in Greece, he settled in Athens as a merchant. In 1847 his house was burned down in an anti-Semitic riot, the police standing quietly by. Pacifico demanded compensation from the Greek government and was supported by Britain’s foreign secretary, Lord Palmerston. Palmerston sent a naval squadron to blockade the Greek coast (January 1850) and force the Greeks to meet Pacifico’s demands. This brought protests from the French and the Russians, with whom Britain shared a protectorate of Greece. Nevertheless, the Greeks acceded to the payment of £4,000, though, because of the loss of some papers, a commission awarded Pacifico only £150. He moved to London, where he died on April 12, 1854.
The incident had its greatest effect in British internal politics. Palmerston’s policy was censured by the House of Lords (June 18, 1850), but he won the support of the Commons on June 29. During his speech before the vote, he made his famous comparison between the British and Roman empires, saying that, just as a Roman could claim his rights anywhere in the world with the words “Civis Romanus sum” (“I am a Roman citizen”), “so also a British subject, in whatever land he may be, shall feel confident that the watchful eye and the strong arm of England will protect him against injustice and wrong.”
