Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca,  Küçük Kaynarca also spelled Kuchuk Kainarji,  (July 10 [July 21, New Style], 1774), pact signed at the conclusion of the Russo-Turkish War of 1768–74 at Küçük Kaynarca, in Bulgaria, ending undisputed Ottoman control of the Black Sea and providing a diplomatic basis for future Russian intervention in internal affairs of the Ottoman Empire.
The territorial provisions of the treaty extended the Russian frontier to the southern Bug River, thus ceding to Russia the port of Azov, the fortresses of Kerch and Yenikale on the eastern end of the Crimean Peninsula, a part of the province of Kuban, and the estuary formed by the Dnieper and Bug rivers, including the Kinburn fortress. The territory of the Crimean khanate was to form an independent state, subject to the Ottoman sultan-caliph only in religious matters.
The treaty’s commercial provisions gave Russia the right to establish consulates anywhere in the Ottoman Empire, to navigate freely in Ottoman waters through the Straits of the Bosporus and the Dardanelles, and to enjoy commercial privileges in Ottoman lands.
Most far-reaching, however, was a religious stipulation that accorded to Russia the privilege of representing, within the Ottoman Empire, the Greek Orthodox Christians in Moldavia and Walachia (which were to be returned to Turkey) and in the Aegean Islands. Later, Russia freely interpreted and employed this provision to support its claims to a protectorate over the Greek Orthodox Christians anywhere in the Ottoman Empire.
