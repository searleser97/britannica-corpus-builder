International Association of Lions Clubs,  civilian service organization established by a Chicago insurance broker, Melvin Jones, in Dallas, Texas, in 1917 to foster a spirit of “generous consideration” among peoples of the world and to promote good government, good citizenship, and an active interest in civic, social, commercial, and moral welfare. Jones remained an active member of the Lions Clubs until his death in 1961. Because the Lions Club adopted more lenient membership rules than other service clubs and did not impose a rigid quota on membership from each business and profession, it soon became the largest of all service club organizations.
Lions’ activities include neighbourhood-improvement projects, environmental and conservation programs, educational and literacy services, aid to the blind and the hearing-impaired, disaster relief, support for victims of pediatric cancer and their families, and hunger relief. A parallel organization, Leos, comprises clubs for children age 12 to 18 (Alpha Leos) and for young adults age 18 to 30 (Omega Leos). The Lions Clubs, with members in more than 200 countries and geographic areas, are headquartered in Oakbrook, Illinois, U.S.
