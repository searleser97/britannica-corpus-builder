Anglo-German Naval Agreement,  (June 18, 1935) bilateral concord between Britain and Germany countenancing a German navy but limiting it to 35 percent of the size of the British navy. Part of the process of appeasement before World War II, the agreement allowed Germany to violate restrictions imposed by the Treaty of Versailles, prompting international criticism and driving a wedge between the French and the British.
