International Committee of the Red Cross , (ICRC), French Comité International de la Croix-Rouge,  international nongovernmental organization headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, that seeks to aid victims of war and to ensure the observance of humanitarian law by all parties in conflict. The work of the ICRC in both World Wars was recognized by the Nobel Prize for Peace in both 1917 and 1944. It shared another Nobel Peace Prize with the League of Red Cross Societies in 1963, the year of the 100th anniversary of the ICRC’s founding.
The International Committee of the Red Cross was formed in response to the experiences of its founder, Jean-Henri Dunant, at the Battle of Solferino in 1859. Dunant witnessed thousands of wounded soldiers left to die for lack of adequate medical services. Soliciting help from neighbouring civilians, Dunant organized care for the soldiers. In 1862 he published an account of the situation at Solferino; by 1863 he had garnered so much support that the Geneva Society for Public Welfare helped found the International Committee for the Relief of the Wounded. In 1875 this organization became the International Committee of the Red Cross.
The ICRC is now one component of a large network including national Red Cross and Red Crescent societies and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. (The Red Crescent was adopted in lieu of the Red Cross in Muslim countries.) The governing body of the ICRC is the Committee, consisting of no more than 25 members. All the members are Swiss, in part due to the origins of the Red Cross in Geneva but also to establish neutrality so any countries in need can receive aid. The Committee meets in assembly 10 times each year to ensure that the ICRC fulfills its duties as the promoter of international humanitarian law and as the guardian of the Fundamental Principles of the Red Cross: “humanity, impartiality, neutrality, independence, voluntary service, unity, and universality.”
