Treaty of Kanagawa, also called Perry Convention,  (March 31, 1854), Japan’s first treaty with a Western nation. Concluded by representatives of the United States and Japan at Kanagawa (now part of Yokohama), it marked the end of Japan’s period of seclusion (1639–1854). The treaty was signed as a result of pressure from U.S. Commodore Matthew C. Perry, who sailed into Tokyo Bay with a fleet of warships in July 1853 and demanded that the Japanese open their ports to U.S. ships for supplies. Perry then left Japan in order to give the government a few months to consider its decision. When he returned in February 1854, the Japanese, aware that none of their armaments was a match for Perry’s warships, agreed to admit U.S. ships to the ports of Shimoda and Hakodate and to accept a U.S. consul at Shimoda. The Treaty of Kanagawa was the first of the treaties signed between Japan and other Western countries in the 19th century.
