Special Air Service Regiment (SASR), also called Special Air Service (SAS),  Australian special forces unit that exists within Australia’s Special Operations Command. The unit was formed in July 1957 as the 1st Special Air Service Company, Royal Australian Infantry, and it was modeled on the British Special Air Service.
Its first mission, in February 1965, was to quell insurgencies on Borneo. The SASR fought in the Vietnam War (1954–75), where its members earned the nickname ma rung (“phantoms of the jungle”) for their stealthy maneuvers. Since Vietnam the SASR has assumed dual roles: “green” operations, which encompass army special operations responsibilities, and “black” operations, or counterterrorist actions. Each squadron spends one 12-month rotation on black duty, during which it is permanently on call. The three rotating SASR squadrons are each composed of three troops: a boat troop with expertise in submarine operations, an airborne troop with specialized parachuting capabilities, and ground specialists trained in jungle warfare and long-range desert reconnaissance. The existence of SASR Squadron 4, raised in 2005 to serve as a full-time clandestine military intelligence force, is not publicly acknowledged by the Australian government.
SASR units often cross-train with other elite counterterrorism forces, including the British SAS, U.S. Navy SEALs, and Germany’s Grenzschutzgruppe 9 (GSG 9). They worked alongside U.S. forces in Somalia in the 1990s as well as during the Persian Gulf War (1990–91) and the Afghanistan War (2001– ). The SASR was one of the first allied forces to have soldiers on the ground in Afghanistan, fielding up to 1,100 personnel in the first six months of Operation Enduring Freedom. Since its inception the SASR has maintained a close relationship to the British SAS, and the two forces have engaged in various joint operations, including in Northern Ireland and Bosnia.
