Centurion,   the principal professional officer in the armies of ancient Rome and its empire. The centurion was the commander of a centuria, which was the smallest unit of a Roman legion. A legion was nominally composed of 6,000 soldiers, and each legion was divided up into 10 cohorts, with each cohort containing 6 centuria. The centurion thus nominally commanded about 100 men, and there were 60 centurions in a legion. The centurions in a legion were arranged in a complicated order of rank, with variations in authority and responsibility from top to bottom. There was little actual difference in status between most of these centurion ranks, however, with the exception of the first-ranking centurion of the first-ranking cohort; this officer, the primus pilus, participated in councils of war with the military tribunes and the legion commander. Most centurions were of plebeian origin and were promoted from the ranks of the common soldiers. They formed the backbone of the legion and were responsible for enforcing discipline. They received much higher pay and a greater share of the spoils than did common soldiers.
