Army of the Andes,  military force of 3,500 soldiers organized by the South American independence leader José de San Martín. In 1817 San Martín led the soldiers from Argentina across the Andes Mountains to liberate Chile from Spanish colonial rule. San Martín’s challenge was to coordinate the difficult passage across the Andes. The soldiers were divided into four columns: two major ones, the first under generals Miguel Estanislao Soler and Bernardo O’Higgins, and the second under Juan Las Heras; and two smaller wing divisions. All four concentrations of forces had to execute the monthlong march by different routes and appear in Chilean territory between February 6 and 8, 1817.
On February 12 the rebels met a Spanish army under Gen. Raphael Maroto at Chacabuco (see Battle of Chacabuco). San Martín separated his forces into two wings under Soler and O’Higgins, respectively. O’Higgins attacked prematurely, narrowly averting defeat. When Soler appeared, O’Higgins was able to regroup and mount a two-battalion bayonet charge that left the Spaniards surrounded. The victorious San Martín entered Santiago, Chile, on February 14. The success of this operation established San Martín’s reputation as a great general.
