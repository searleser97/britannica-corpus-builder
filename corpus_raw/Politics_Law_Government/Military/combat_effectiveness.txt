Combat effectiveness,  the readiness of a military unit to engage in combat based on behavioral, operational, and leadership considerations. Combat effectiveness measures the ability of a military force to accomplish its objective and is one component of overall military effectiveness.
The effectiveness of a military unit in performing its mission depends on its capabilities (including equipment and personnel) and its ability to use those capabilities. Soldiers must be instructed in the use of their weapons as well as in the battlefield tactics needed to fight as a coordinated team. They also must be trained to follow orders and to make difficult decisions under intense pressure. Indoctrination and leadership play key roles, as a soldier must know his or her role and be willing to perform it. Officers must be able to bring out the best in their troops and know how to motivate them to become an effective fighting force. Thus, simply having a large or well-equipped force does not guarantee success on the battlefield. Military planning—identifying the adversary and developing a strategy that combines the most appropriate weapons, unit types, and combat plan to implement against that particular adversary—also plays an important role in combat effectiveness, as well as in military effectiveness more broadly.
