ʿayyār, (Arabic: “vagabond,” “scoundrel”, ) Arabic plural ʿayyārūn, Persian plural ʿayyārān,  any member of a class of warriors common to Iraq and Iran in the 9th–12th century, often associated in futūwah, medieval Islāmic urban organizations.
Though ʿayyārūn were found fighting for Islām on the frontiers of inner Asia, the most thorough documentation of these warriors describes their activities in Baghdad in the 10th–12th century, a picture that may not be typical of ʿayyārūn in other areas. The Baghdad of this period, ruled by the Būyids (945–1055), was an especially lawless city, troubled by violent battles between members of the Sunnite and Shīʿite sects of Islām. ʿAyyārūn terrorized the city, extorting taxes on roads or at markets, burning wealthy quarters and markets, and looting the homes of the rich at night. For several years (1028–33), Al-Burjumī and Ibn al-Mawṣilī, leaders of the ʿayyārūn, virtually ruled the city in the face of an ineffectual government.
Although the ʿayyārūn have been commonly labeled thieves and robbers, modern historians point out that their activities multiplied only in times of weak central government or in times of civil war, when their services were sought by many of the conflicting parties. Under strong rulers their lawlessness subsided, and, with the appearance of the Seljuqs in the 12th century, it ceased. The ʿayyārūn, in reaction to social injustice, warred against the government and the wealthy, the police, and the merchant classes.
Outside Baghdad, from inner Asia to Mesopotamia, the ʿayyārūn identified more closely with the middle class, who depended on them to support the local dynasty or displace it. They even succeeded in setting up a dynasty of their own, the Ṣaffārids (867–c. 1495), in eastern Iran.
