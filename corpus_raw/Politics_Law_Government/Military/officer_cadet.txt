Officer cadet,  a young person undergoing training to become an armed forces officer.
The term cadet arose in France, where it was applied to younger sons of the nobility who gained commissioned rank after being attached for a time without pay to active army units. The word is applied in most nations to candidates for commission who are students in national military schools. In the United States, for example, cadet is the official title of students at the Military Academy at West Point, New York, and at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Students at the Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, are known as midshipmen, their official navy rank, although they were known as cadets in the 19th century. Both the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in Britain and the French military academy at Saint-Cyr also refer to their officer candidates as cadets. Although attendance at these academies traditionally had been closed to women, by the late 20th century virtually all of them had begun to enroll female cadets.
