Ensign,  junior officer, generally the lowest commissioned rank in military services where such a rank exists. In the U.S. Navy, ensign has been the lowest commissioned rank since 1862, when it replaced “passed midshipman.” The Continental Army had a grade of ensign during the American Revolution, as did the U.S. Army until 1815. The lowest commissioned rank in the British Army until 1871 was ensign. As a military rank, ensign has generally been replaced by the rank of second lieutenant.
