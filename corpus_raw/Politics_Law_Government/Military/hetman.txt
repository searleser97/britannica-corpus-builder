Hetman,   military title used in the Polish–Lithuanian state (16th–18th century); the hetman wielki (“great hetman”) was the chief of the armed forces and the commander in the field when the king was not present. In Ukraine a variation of the term, ataman, was used to designate the military leader of the Zaporozhian Cossacks (16th century) and the prince of the area east of the Dnieper River (17th–18th century). Ataman was also the name of the elected commander of the various great Cossack hosts in Russia; after 1723, however, only atamans of the villages were elected.
