Panzer division, German Panzerdivision,  (“armoured division”), a self-contained combined-arms military unit of the German army, built around and deriving its mission largely from the capabilities of armoured fighting vehicles. A panzer division in World War II consisted of a tank brigade with four battalions, a motorized infantry brigade with four rifle battalions, an artillery regiment, and reconnaissance, antitank, and engineer battalions and service units. Early in the war the panzer divisions used mostly light tanks, and later they used mostly medium tanks.
The first three panzer divisions were created in October 1935, and by the outbreak of war in 1939 there were six. Panzer divisions formed the decisive striking force of the German army in the campaigns against Poland in 1939, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and France in 1940, and the Balkans and the Soviet Union in 1941. In the campaign against France, there were 10 panzer divisions incorporating all the German tanks in that campaign—2,574 out of the 3,400 tanks that Germany possessed. After the French campaign the number of panzer divisions was doubled, and in 1941 17 of them, grouped in four panzer armies, spearheaded the German invasion of the Soviet Union.
Since World War II, despite the acquisition of more advanced weapons and changes in ratios among constituent elements, the panzer division’s mission has not undergone significant change. It remains the principal offensive element of the German army.
