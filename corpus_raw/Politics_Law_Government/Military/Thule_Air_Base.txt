Thule Air Base, Greenlandic Pituffik,  U.S. air base and communications centre, northwestern Greenland. It lies on Cape Atholl and the southern shore of Wolstenholme Fjord, an inlet of Baffin Bay. Near the base is the former Greenlandic (Eskimo) settlement of Umanak (Danish: Dundas). The region was explored (1912–33) by the expeditions of Knud Rasmussen, who founded a settlement there in 1910. A joint U.S.-Danish weather station was established in the area after World War II. When the air base was built in 1951–52, the indigenous population was relocated to other settlements, particularly the town of Qaanaaq to the north. The base functioned as an intermediate stop on the transpolar air route between North America and northern Europe, and a ballistic missile early warning station was completed in 1961. The base continued to operate a missile warning system in the early 21st century.
