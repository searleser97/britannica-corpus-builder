Brigadier general,  military rank just above that of colonel. In both the British and U.S. armies of World War I, a brigadier general commanded a brigade. When the British abolished the brigade, they discontinued the rank of brigadier general but revived it as plain brigadier in 1928. In the U.S. and French military services, the brigadier general is the lowest-ranking general officer.
