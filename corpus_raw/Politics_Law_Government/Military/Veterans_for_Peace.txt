Veterans for Peace (VFP),  American nongovernmental organization founded in 1985 that works to expose the actual cost of every war and that advocates for peace. Its members include veterans of World War II, Korea, Vietnam, and the Persian Gulf War as well as those of various 21st-century conflicts. Veterans for Peace (VFP) headquarters are in St. Louis, Missouri.
The goal of VFP is to work toward effective, peaceful solutions to conflict and to find alternatives to the military actions of the U.S. government. Members of VFP work to secure veteransâ€™ rights, and VFP serves as a support system for veterans and their families. Members of VFP plan and participate in national and local educational forums, teach-ins, and demonstrations. They also aid countermilitary recruitment in schools. Each year members gather to protest the School of the Americas at Fort Benning, Georgia.
VFP uses an annual convention to disseminate information, organize on the national level, and provide a space for veterans and their families to gather. Members of VFP also work internationally in such places as Vietnam and South Korea to help those afflicted by war and other operations performed by the U.S. military.
