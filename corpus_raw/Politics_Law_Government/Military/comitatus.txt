Comitatus,   (Latin: “retinue”), in ancient Republican Rome, an elite company of one of the army commanders. A comitatus was formed in the assembly when one of the leading men announced that he needed followers to accompany him on a foray into enemy territory. Those who were attracted by the proposal, usually the more well-to-do warriors, would volunteer their services. At that time the relationship between leader and followers, who were called comites (“companions”), was a temporary one, lasting only for the duration of the raid. Later, the arrangement became permanent; the leader fed the comitatus and kept the company about him in peace as well as in war. He supplied the members with their weapons and horses and shared with them the spoils of war. A military force was thus established over which the other warriors had little or no control. Members of the comitatus were willing to fight to the death for their leader; it was a disgrace for them to survive him.
