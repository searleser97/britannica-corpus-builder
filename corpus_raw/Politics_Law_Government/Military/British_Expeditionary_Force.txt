British Expeditionary Force (BEF),  the home-based British army forces that went to northern France at the start of World Wars I and II in order to support the left wing of the French armies.
The BEF originated in the army reform of 1908 sponsored by Richard Burdon (later Viscount) Haldane. Prior to this reform, it had been customary in the British army to ship off individual units and organize them into brigades or larger units when they had arrived at the theatre of operations. But by the first decade of the 20th century, in the light of Britain’s treaty obligations to help France defend itself against a possible German attack, it was clear that the larger units of the British army had to be organized and trained as units before such a war ever began, if they were to be used quickly and effectively. The Haldane reforms provided for the organization of the home-based forces of the regular army into an “expeditionary force” consisting of six infantry divisions and one cavalry division. Four of these infantry divisions and the cavalry division went to France at the outbreak of World War I (1914), where they sustained heavy losses. The BEF sent to France early in World War II (1939) was brought back to England when France fell (1940), and the British effort was again continued on other battlefields by numbered armies.
