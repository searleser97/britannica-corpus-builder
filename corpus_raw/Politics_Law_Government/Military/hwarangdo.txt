Hwarangdo, (Korean: “flower youth”)  youth group following a unique military and philosophical code developed in the ancient Korean state of Silla about the 6th century ce. The hwarangdo were groups of elite youths (hwarang; the suffix -do means “group,” “disciple,” or “follower”) who were trained almost equally in academic and martial skills. The hwarang warriors were said to have played an instrumental role in Silla’s conquest of the rest of the Korean peninsula and in the establishment of the Unified Silla dynasty (668–935).
The hwarang organization was a survival of the youth bands of early Korean society. During the reign of King Chinhŭng (540–576), the groups were formally organized by the government. Each hwarang group was composed of young Silla men of aristocratic birth, sometimes numbering in the thousands, who were organized under a single leader. A spirit of chivalry was a part of hwarangdo training, and its practitioners frequently engaged in a kind of religious cult in which they prayed for the welfare of the state by visiting beautiful mountains and rivers and engaging in ritual songs and dances. They also chanted hyangga, special Silla poems with religious flavour.
The guiding principle in the education of the hwarang can be seen in the sesok o-kye (“five commandments”). These norms of virtuous conduct, apparently derived from Confucian and Buddhist teachings, taught loyal service to the king, filial piety, faithfulness to friends, courage in battle, and the evil of indiscriminate killing.
The prominence of the hwarangdo began to decline with the disintegration of Silla rule, and the hwarang were officially disbanded during the Chosŏn (Yi) dynasty (1392–1910). Interest in the hwarangdo was renewed in the second half of the 20th century, and one style of modern Korean martial arts is known as Hwa Rang Do.
