Doughboy,  nickname popularly given to United States soldiers during World War I. The term was first used during the American Civil War when it was applied to the brass buttons on uniforms and thence to infantrymen. At a period not exactly ascertained, the word was said to have been derived from the doughlike appearance of a uniform soiled by moistened pipe clay. Again, infantrymen were said to march in "dough" during wet weather. "Adobe" furnishes a similar derivation, although it may be a popular etymology or wholesale transference of a foreign word to an English meaning and spelling.
