Noncommissioned officer (NCO), also spelled non-commissioned officer,  military officer appointed by a commissioned officer, generally to supervise enlisted soldiers and aid the commissioned officer corps. The noncommissioned officer corps is the administrative apparatus of the U.S. military, and NCOs are vital to the routine management of military operations for numerous countries. NCOs receive their authority from commissioned officers, who in turn receive their authority from a sovereign power.
NCOs typically function at the rank of sergeant but can also serve as corporals and petty officers (in the navy) and receive advanced military training. Tactical NCOs are responsible for training leaders for companies of cadets at the U.S. Military Academy, with duties ranging from teaching and supervising drill and ceremony procedures to military training.
