Commando,   military unit—roughly equivalent to an infantry battalion—consisting of men especially trained to employ guerrilla-like shock tactics ranging from hand-to-hand combat to hit-and-run raids. A member of such a unit is also called a commando. In general usage, the term also refers to irregular or guerrilla tactics carried out by small regular units. The commando originated with the Boers in South Africa, where it was the administrative and tactical unit “commandeered” by law.
