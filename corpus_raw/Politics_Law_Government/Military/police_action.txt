Police action,  isolated military undertaking that does not require a declaration of war. Police action is intended to respond to a state that is in violation of international treaties or norms or that has engaged in or has imminently threatened an act of aggression.
Under international law, specifically Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, police actions are permissible under two circumstances. First, military action can be initiated when a state has perpetrated an act of aggression against another state or when it has otherwise posed a threat to international peace and security, as was the case in the Korean War. In such instances, a collective decision must be made by the United Nations to curb these threats through the use of police action. Second, police action is permissible when a state acts in self-defense against imminent attack by another state, which is deemed the aggressor even if it has not yet attacked. Although it has occasionally been permissible for outside police action to infringe upon states whose governments perpetrate atrocities against their own people, that criterion has not been consistently applied in international law. The UN did approve police action in Libya in 2011 to protect civilians in the violent insurgency against Muammar al-Qaddafi. Since the September 11 attacks, states have militarily pursued individuals they deem terrorists within the borders of other states in a form of police action that is not clearly defined in the international guidelines.
