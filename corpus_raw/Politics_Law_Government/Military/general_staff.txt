General staff,   in the military, a group of officers that assists the commander of a division or larger unit by formulating and disseminating his policies, transmitting his orders, and overseeing their execution. Normally a general staff is organized along functional lines, with separate sections for administration, intelligence, operations, training, logistics, and other categories. In many countries a similar but more elaborately organized staff assists the supreme military authority. While a general staff contains specialists as well as more broadly trained officers, it is distinguished in character and functions from special staffs (in the U.S. Army) consisting of technical specialists in the various services: medical, police, communications, supply, and others.
Although the name general staff was sometimes applied to high military staffs in the 18th century, the institution did not appear in its modern form until the early 19th century, in the Prussian army, and in other European countries after 1870. The U.S. Army created a general staff in 1903, the British army in 1906. In the British and U.S. armies, however, the general staff differed from that of the Prussian army in that the officers, although especially qualified, were not trained as an elite corps; they were individually selected from the officer corps as a whole just as for other assignments. The air force counterpart of army general staff is usually called the air staff.
