Adjutant general,  an army or air force official, originally the chief assistant or staff officer to a general in command but later a senior staff officer with solely administrative responsibilities.
In Britain the second military member of the army council was historically styled adjutant general to the forces. That department was charged with all duties pertaining to personnel; in 2016 the adjutant general post was renamed Commander Home Command. The adjutant general of the U.S. Army serves as a principal assistant to the chief of staff. The adjutant general heads the adjutant generalâ€™s corps, an administrative service that publishes all army orders; is responsible for army correspondence; and oversees personnel actions, records, decorations and awards, publications, postal service, recreational activities, and career guidance. The adjutant general of the U.S. Air Force has comparable functions. The principal administrative staff officers of large subdivisions of the U.S. army, such as divisions, corps and armies, are entitled adjutants general, though they usually hold the rank of lieutenant colonel or colonel. Each U.S. state has its own adjutant general, with administrative duties regarding the state national guard or militia.
