regiment,  in most armies, a body of troops headed by a colonel and organized for tactical control into companies, battalions, or squadrons. French cavalry units were called regiments as early as 1558. The word is derived from the Latin regimen, a rule or system of order, and describes the regiment’s functions of raising, equipping, and training troops. As a regiment acquired individuality, colours, coat of arms, distinctive uniform and insignia, and achievements in battle, it also became a central object of loyalty, pride, and esprit de corps of its soldiers.
In early U.S. service, as in European armies up to that time, the usual number of companies in a regiment was 10. The armies of the French Revolution were reorganized into three-battalion “demibrigades” that were later renamed regiments. In 19th-century Europe, three-battalion regiments increasingly became the norm, though some of Napoleon’s regiments had as many as five with the colours. Later, Edward Cardwell reorganized the British infantry into two-battalion regiments, each having one battalion at home and one stationed overseas. The U.S. Army adopted a three-battalion infantry regimental organization in 1901 and incorporated it into the divisions employed in World War I, World War II, and the Korean War.
