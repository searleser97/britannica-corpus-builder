Fort Knox,  major U.S. military reservation in Meade, Hardin, and Bullitt counties, northern Kentucky, U.S. It lies 30 miles (48 km) southwest of Louisville and occupies an area of 172 square miles (445 square km). It was established in 1918 as Camp Knox (named for Major General Henry Knox, first U.S. secretary of war), and it became a permanent military post in 1932. For maximum security, the U.S. Bullion Depository, a solid square bombproof structure with mechanical protective devices, was built there in 1936 to hold the bulk of the nation’s gold reserves. During World War II the gold vault was used as a repository for the original copy of the U.S. Constitution and Declaration of Independence, the Magna Carta, and the original draft of Abraham Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address.
Since 1940 Fort Knox has been the U.S. Army Armor Headquarters with various training schools; all U.S. Army armored soldiers serve there at least once during their enlistment. Its Patton Museum of Cavalry and Armor displays American Civil War weapons and captured enemy weapons.
