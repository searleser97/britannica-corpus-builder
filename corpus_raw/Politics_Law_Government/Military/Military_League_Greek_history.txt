Military League, Greek Stratiotikos Syndesmos,  group of young Greek army officers who, emulating the Young Turk Committee of Union and Progress, sought to reform their country’s national government and reorganize the army. The league was formed in May 1909 and was led by Colonel Nikolaós Zorbas. In August 1909 the Athens garrison moved to the neighbouring Goudhi Hill and forced the resignation of Premier Demetrios Rhalles, replacing him with Kyriakoules Mavromichales. It also forced King George I to dismiss his sons from military commands. The league found itself unable to create a new political system, however, and therefore summoned the Cretan politician Eleuthérios Venizélos to Athens (Modern Greek: Athína) as its political adviser. Venizélos persuaded the king to revise the constitution and asked the league to disband in favour of a National Assembly. In March 1910 the Military League dissolved itself.
