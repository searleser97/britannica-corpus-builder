Evzones,  members of elite mountain infantry units in the Greek army, analogous to Scottish Highlanders. They are distinguished by their picturesque white jackets, wide skirts, and Albanian-type slippers with turned-up tufted toes.
Organized units of evzones, who originated in Epirus, have existed since the Greek War of Independence. They won fame for their bravery and tenacity in the Balkan Wars and in World War II. In November 1940 an evzone regiment turned the tide of the Italian invasion by trapping and destroying a crack alpine division at Metsovo Pass, using their traditional tactic of sweeping down from the ridges while screaming their battle cry “Aera!” (“Like the wind!”). After World War II the regiments were disbanded, and only a royal guard was retained at Athens.
