Morosini Family,   noble Venetian family that gave four doges and several generals and admirals to the Republic, as well as two cardinals and many other prelates to the Roman Catholic Church. The Morosini first achieved prominence in the 10th century when they destroyed the rival Caloprino family for planning to surrender Venice to the Holy Roman emperor Otto II.
Domenico Morosini (d. 1156), who was elected doge in 1148, consolidated and extended Venetian power in Istria, Dalmatia, and the Adriatic. Marino was doge from 1249 to 1253. Ruggiero (Roger) served as admiral in the war against Genoa that ended with the Genoese victory at the Battle of Curzola (1298). Michele, who was doge for a few months in 1382, played a conspicuous part in the peace negotiations with Genoa of that year. Antonio (c. 1366–c. 1434) used his seat in the grand council as an observation post to assist in compiling a history of Venice. His chronicling of the events of his own time was more scrupulous than suited the government, which forced him to amend his text. By contrast, a later Morosini, Andrea (1558–1618), was commissioned by the Senate to contribute to an official history of the republic for the years 1521–1615. Andrea’s history was acceptable to lay authorities but not the church.
The most illustrious member of the family, Francesco Morosini (1618–94), rose in the prolonged wars with the Turks in the 17th century to become one of the greatest captains of his time. Commander in chief of the Venetian fleet in 1657, he conducted several successful campaigns before he was recalled through the intrigues of a rival. Sent to relieve besieged Candia (Crete) in 1667, he was unable to save the city from surrender but was absolved of blame and, on the renewal of the war in 1684, again was appointed commander in chief. After several brilliant victories he reconquered the Peloponnesus and Athens; on his return to Venice he was loaded with honours and given the title “Peloponnesiaco.” Elected doge in 1688, five years later, at the age of 75, he once more assumed command of the fleet against the Turks; such was the respect of the Turks for his prowess that their fleet, cruising in the Venetian archipelago, withdrew at his approach.
