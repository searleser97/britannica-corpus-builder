General Confederation of Labour, Spanish Confederación General del Trabajo (CGT),  major labour-union federation in Argentina. The CGT was formed in 1930. Its leadership was contested by socialist, anarchist, and syndicalist   factions from 1935 until the early 1940s, when it came under the control of Juan Perón, an ambitious Cabinet minister. When Perón was ousted from his Cabinet posts and placed in detention in October 1945, a strike called by the CGT won his release from custody and helped lay the groundwork for his ascent to the presidency  of Argentina in 1946. During Perón’s  two terms as president,  the CGT  grew to include 2,000,000  affiliated members and acquired a vast network of patronage and welfarism.
After Perón’s removal by the military in 1955, the CGT was officially disbanded, but it continued to be a mainstay of the Peronist movement, which was weakened by factional struggles. By the time the CGT reemerged in the early 1960s,  it was equally divided between Peronist and noncommunist independent blocs. A period of military rule in Argentina (1966–73) led the CGT to pursue political as well as economic goals, although these were sometimes contradictory, and led to further fragmentation of the group in the late 1960s.
During the second Peronist government (1973–76), the CGT again achieved considerable political power and expanded to embrace white-collar as well as industrial workers. During the subsequent period of military rule (1976–83), the government suppressed the CGT, though it continued to operate illegally. President Raúl Alfonsín (1983–89), whose Radical government clashed with the CGT, most dramatically in a series of general strikes, officially reinstated the federation in 1985.
