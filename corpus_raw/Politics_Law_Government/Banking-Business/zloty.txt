Zloty, (Polish: “gold coin”)  monetary unit of Poland. Each zloty (spelled złoty in Polish) is divided into 100 groszy. The National Bank of Poland has the exclusive right to issue currency in the country. Coins range from 1 groszy to 5 zlotys, and bills are issued in amounts varying between 10 and 200 zlotys. On the obverse side of the banknotes are historical figures; for example, King Casimir III (1310–70) appears on the 50-zloty note, and King Sigismund I (1467–1548) is on the 200-zloty bill. The reverse side is adorned with a symbol of the reign of the figure on the front. For example, the 50-zloty note contains an eagle from the royal seal of Casimir III, and the 200-zloty note depicts an eagle intertwined with an S, a design taken from a chapel bearing Sigismund’s name.
Before the introduction of the zloty, many currency systems had existed in Poland. The zloty was first adopted during the reign of Sigismund I in an effort to reform and consolidate the various systems, and it soon spread to both Lithuania and Prussia. The zloty has continued as Poland’s currency unit, though it has undergone many alterations, particularly with regard to its value and subdivisions, and foreign currencies, such as Russian rubles in the 19th century, have been used in Poland at various times. Following World War I, when Poland suffered from hyperinflation, a new zloty was introduced to help stabilize the economy. In 1995, to help revive the economy, Poland’s postcommunist regime introduced a new zloty at a rate of 10,000 old zlotys to 1 new zloty. Thereafter the currency became convertible on international markets, and the government later pegged the zloty to the euro, the European Union’s single currency.
