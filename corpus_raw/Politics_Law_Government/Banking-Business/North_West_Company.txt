North West Company,   Canadian fur-trading company, once the chief rival of the powerful Hudson’s Bay Company. The company was founded in 1783 and enjoyed a rapid growth. It originally confined its operations to the Lake Superior region and the valleys of the Red, Assiniboine, and Saskatchewan rivers but later spread north and west to the shores of the Arctic and Pacific oceans. It even penetrated the area then known as the Oregon Country, where it constructed posts in what are now the U.S. states of Washington and Idaho. Its wilderness headquarters was located first at Grand Portage on Lake Superior and after 1805 at Fort William (also on Lake Superior, at the site of the present city of Thunder Bay, Ont.).
Competition with the Hudson’s Bay Company became especially intense when that company established the colony of Assiniboia on the Red River (in present-day Manitoba) in 1811–12, across the North West Company’s line of communications. A few years later, open conflict broke out, during which North West Company men destroyed the Red River colony (see Seven Oaks Massacre) and Hudson’s Bay Company men destroyed the North West Company post of Fort Gibraltar (located on the site of modern Winnipeg, Man.) and captured Fort William.
Under pressure from the British government, the old North West Company and the Hudson’s Bay Company were merged in 1821 under the name and charter of the latter company.
The New North West Company, or XY Company, had a brief existence (1798–1804) as a competitor of the old North West Company before being absorbed by the latter.
