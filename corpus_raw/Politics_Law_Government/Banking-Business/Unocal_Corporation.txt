Unocal Corporation, originally (1890–1983) Union Oil Company of California,  former American petroleum corporation founded in 1890 with the union of three wildcatter companies—the Hardison & Stewart Oil Company, the Sespe Oil Company, and the Torrey Canyon Oil Company. Originally centred in Santa Paula, California, it became headquartered in Los Angeles in 1900. The name Unocal was adopted in 1983, when the company was reorganized. It was purchased by Chevron Corporation in 2005.
The founders of the Union Oil Company were Wallace L. Hardison (1850–1909), Lyman Stewart (1840–1923), and Thomas R. Bard (1841–1915), who became the company’s first president and later a U.S. senator (1900–05). Initially an oil producer and refiner, Union began, after the turn of the century, to construct pipelines and tankers and to market products not only in the United States but also in Europe, South America, and Asia. In 1917 it bought Pinal-Dome Oil Company and its 20 filling stations in southern California, thus beginning retail operations. In 1965 it acquired, through merger, the Pure Oil Company (operating mainly in Texas and the Gulf of Mexico), thereby doubling Union’s size.
Unocal engaged in the worldwide exploration, production, transportation, and marketing of crude oil and natural gas; the manufacture and sale of petroleum products, chemicals, and fertilizers; the mining, processing, and sale of such elements as molybdenum, columbium, rare earths, and uranium; the mining and retorting of oil shales; and the development of geothermal power. It owned a major interest in Union Oil Company of Canada Ltd. The company’s trademark was Union 76.
