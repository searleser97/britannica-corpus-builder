Pirelli SpA,   international holding company and major Italian manufacturer of tires and other rubber products. It is headquartered in Milan.
Three generations of the Pirelli family have managed the company since it was founded in 1872 by Giovanni Battista Pirelli. He started a small rubber factory in Milan that year and went on to produce insulated telegraph cables, bicycle tires, and automobile tires (from 1900). The company opened new factories in Italy and abroad as demand for its tires, cables, and transmission belts grew. In 1920 the Società Italiana Pirelli, later renamed Pirelli SpA, was set up as a holding company to control the Pirelli group’s operations in Italy, while another holding company was created to manage its ventures elsewhere in Europe and in South America. The Pirelli company was responsible for several innovations in tire design, including the crossply tire in 1927 and the fabric-belted tire after World War II.
Pirelli SpA experienced a prolonged expansion in the postwar decades, but by 1970 it was encountering stiff competition from the French tire manufacturer Michelin, which had pioneered the steel-belted radial tire. Partly to counter this threat, Pirelli in 1971 merged with Dunlop Holdings, Ltd., a large British tire maker. The merger brought together the resources of Europe’s two largest tire and rubber companies, but it was not a success and was dissolved in 1981.
A diversified company with operations in Europe, North and South America, and the Middle East, Pirelli sells more goods abroad than does any other Italian company. In addition to manufacturing tires, it is also a major producer of metal cable and electrical equipment. One subsidiary specializes in making optical fibres for telecommunications cable.
