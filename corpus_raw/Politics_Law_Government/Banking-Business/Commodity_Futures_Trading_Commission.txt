Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC),  agency of the U.S. federal government charged with regulating commodity and financial futures and options contracts and markets. The CFTC protects market users and the public from fraud, manipulation, and abusive practices related to sales of these instruments. It also regulates financial practices in the markets to ensure their soundness and financial integrity. Regulation by the CFTC helps the markets to provide a means for price discovery and the hedging of price risk.
Organized commodity futures markets arose in the United States about 1850 with the establishment of the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. At their outset, these markets traded futures based exclusively on agricultural commodities such as corn and wheat. They first came under federal regulation in the 1920s; the CFTC was created as an independent agency in 1974. Since the 1970s, futures and options markets have expanded in size and scope, with trading of futures and options on many nonagricultural commodities. These now include oil, gold, and financial instruments, such as foreign currencies, stock indexes, and Treasury debt instruments. The markets regulated by the CFTC are of huge financial size and importance, with many billions of dollars being traded in these markets annually. After the financial crisis of 2008, the CFTC was also given the authority to regulate and reform the swaps market, the over-the-counter trading of customized contracts between private parties that make up another class of derivatives.
