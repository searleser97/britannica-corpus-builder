Volvo Aktiebolaget,  major Swedish manufacturer of buses, trucks, construction equipment, and related products. Headquarters are in Gothenburg.
Volvo was created in 1926 as a wholly owned subsidiary of AB Svenska Kullagerfabriken and became an independent corporation in 1935. Its original business was the assembly of cars and trucks, but by acquiring its suppliers, as well as by internal expansion, Volvo grew from assembly into a major manufacturer. It acquired engine builder AB Pentaverken in 1930, transmission and axle manufacturer Köpings Mekaniska Verkstad AB in 1942, and car-body manufacturer Svenska Stålpressnings AB in 1969.
As an automaker, Volvo produced a range of models—including compact and medium-sized passenger cars as well as sport-utility vehicles—with an emphasis on comfort and safety features. In 1999 the Volvo subsidiary responsible for automobiles, Volvo Cars, was purchased by the Ford Motor Company.
Volvo began making trucks in 1928, becoming one of Europe’s leading manufacturers of heavy-duty trucks, and it started manufacturing buses in 1931. In the early 21st century, Volvo acquired several companies that strengthened its position as one of the world’s leading manufacturers of trucks. In 2001 it purchased Renault’s truck division, and six years later Volvo became the sole owner of Japan’s Nissan Diesel.
The company also produces marine, industrial, aircraft, and rocket engines; earth-moving, agricultural, and forestry equipment; and recreational and camping products. Other Volvo subsidiaries engage in oil prospecting and trading.
