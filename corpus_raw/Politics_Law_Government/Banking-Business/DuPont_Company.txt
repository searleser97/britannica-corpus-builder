DuPont Company, in full E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company,  American corporation engaged primarily in biotechnology and the manufacture of chemicals and pharmaceuticals. The company was founded by Éleuthère Irénée du Pont (1771–1834) in Delaware in 1802 to produce black powder and later other explosives, which remained the company’s main products until the 20th century, when it began to make many other chemicals as well. DuPont now makes a broad array of industrial chemicals, synthetic fibres, petroleum-based fuels and lubricants, pharmaceuticals, building materials, sterile and specialty packaging materials, cosmetics ingredients, and agricultural chemicals. It has plants, subsidiaries, and affiliates worldwide. Its headquarters are in Wilmington, Del.
As a young French émigré, du Pont discovered that a good prospect for business in America would be the milling of gunpowder. Returning to Paris, he found investors, and on April 21, 1801, the articles of partnership were signed for E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company. On July 19, 1802, he settled along the Brandywine Creek near Wilmington, Del., and hired workmen to build his powder mills. The first black powder was marketed two years later. Sales rose yearly, especially during the War of 1812, and by the time of his death his mills were a major American enterprise.
Blasting powders for industries, mines, and quarries were becoming more important, and in 1857 the company produced a “soda powder” that was the first strictly industrial explosive. In 1880 DuPont began manufacturing nitroglycerin and dynamite.
The company first incorporated in 1899, after nearly a century as a partnership. In 1907 it became the target of a U.S. antitrust suit because of its near monopoly of the American explosives industry, and in 1912 DuPont was forced to divest itself of a major proportion of its gunpowder business. In 1917 the company began buying an interest in General Motors Corporation and owned 25 percent of the stock at the end of 1925. In 1962, after 13 years of antitrust litigation, DuPont was ordered to divest itself of GM stock.
In 1904, as a by-product of its manufacture of explosives, DuPont began producing a special nitrocellulose for lacquers, leather finishes, and so on. The firm expanded into the manufacture of nitrocellulose plastics in 1915, and DuPont’s purchase of a number of firms in 1917 added product lines such as dyestuffs, paints, acids, and heavy chemicals. Its history of creating synthetic polymers made DuPont a world leader in the development of commercial polymers. DuPont introduced neoprene synthetic rubber in 1931 and nylon in 1938. Some of the more better-known synthetic materials developed by DuPont include Lucite, Teflon, Lycra, Orlon, Mylar, Kevlar, Tyvek, and Dacron polyester.
As the firm’s product lines changed, so did its corporate management. From 1802 to 1940, all heads of the company were members of the du Pont family, and all but one (a son-in-law, presiding 1834–37) bore the du Pont name. This control was  reinforced in 1915 by creation of the Christiana Securities Company, whose major stockholders were du Ponts and which had effective control (28 percent) of the shares of E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company (newly incorporated that year). However, by the 1970s, under the tax laws,  the du Ponts found the setup disadvantageous and in 1977 succeeded (after lengthy litigation) in having Christiana merged into the DuPont Company. Direction of the company was passing to persons unrelated to the du Ponts, and the company’s structure was changing: after 1940 only one chief executive was a du Pont (1962–67), and the company underwent extensive departmental reorganizations in 1967 and 1973–76, largely to streamline operations in the face of stiffening foreign competition.
In the 1980s DuPont acquired Conoco, Inc. (Continental Oil Company; spun off in 1998), in what was then the largest merger in corporate history. Additional mergers were undertaken in DuPont’s effort to diversify further. In 1986 the company introduced its stain-resistant Stainmaster carpets, which were soon the best-selling carpet brand in the United States. DuPont entered the global seed market in 1999 with its acquisition of Pioneer Hi-Bred International, the first commercial producer of hybrid seed corn. DuPont subsequently became one of the world’s largest producers of hybrid and genetically engineered seed plants.
In 2004 the company was fined $16.5 million by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for violating the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) by withholding information concerning its release into drinking water in West Virginia of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA; also known as C8), which is known to cause developmental problems in laboratory animals. The company also faced litigation and an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in connection with that incident. In 2006 DuPont and seven other companies agreed with the EPA to cut their production of PFOA by 95 percent by 2010 and to eliminate production completely by 2015.
In 2015 the company merged with former rival Dow Chemical to form DowDuPont.
