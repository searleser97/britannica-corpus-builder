Hawthorne research, also called Hawthorne effect,  socioeconomic experiments conducted by Elton Mayo in 1927 among employees of the Hawthorne Works factory of the Western Electric Company in Cicero, Illinois. For almost a year, a group of female workers were subjected to measured changes in their hours, wages, rest periods, lighting conditions, organization, and degree of supervision and consultation in order to determine what conditions would affect performance or work output.
The study sought to identify those aspects of a job that were most likely to boost worker productivity. At the study’s onset, it was thought that economic factors would have the greatest influence on productivity. The results were surprising: productivity increased, but for reasons unrelated to economics. Ultimately, researchers concluded that job performance improved because more attention was being paid to the workers.
Four general conclusions were drawn from the Hawthorne studies:
In the end, the study demonstrated that social and psychological influences did more to increase output than did changes in wages and hours. This reversed the assumptions long held by managers who believed that economic issues were at the heart of employee motivation. Although the methods of Mayo’s research have been criticized, the results have led managers and scholars to study the human relations that affect employee motivation. See industrial relations.
