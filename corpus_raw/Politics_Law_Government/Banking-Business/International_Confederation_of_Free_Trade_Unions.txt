International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU),   the world’s principal organization of national trade union federations. The ICFTU was  formed in 1949 by Western trade union federations that had withdrawn from the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) after bitter disagreements with the communist-led unions in the WFTU. The chief founders of the new organization were the American Federation of Labor–Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL–CIO) of the United States and the Trades Union Congress of Great Britain. The stated purpose of the new federation was to ensure “collaboration between the free and democratic trade union movements throughout the world.”
The primary strength of the ICFTU lies in the trade union federations of western Europe, North America,  the Commonwealth, and Latin America.  The AFL–CIO withdrew from the ICFTU in 1969 but later rejoined the federation. Other major members are the German Trade Union Federation, the (French) General Confederation of Labour–Workers’ Force, three Italian labour federations, and Poland’s Solidarity union. By the late 20th century the ICFTU had more than 200 member organizations representing 125,000,000 workers in 140 countries and territories. The ICFTU’s headquarters are in Brussels, Belg.
