Gulf Oil Corporation,  former American petroleum company; it was acquired by Chevron Corporation in 1984.
Although Gulf Oil was originally incorporated in 1907, its beginnings go back to the tapping in 1901 of an enormous oil gusher on Spindletop Hill, near Beaumont, Texas. The development of this well was funded by the Mellon family, known for its banking interests in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Following the discovery, Thomas Mellon built the Gulf refinery in Port Arthur, Texas. The firm continued to develop oil fields in Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana, as well as in Mexico and Venezuela; by 1923 the Port Arthur refinery was the largest in the world. Gulf was the first oil company to enter the consumer gasoline market when it opened a drive-in filling station in Pittsburgh in 1913. It invested in forms of energy other than oil and had secondary interests in chemicals, minerals, and nuclear power.
