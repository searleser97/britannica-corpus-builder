Jewel-Osco,  American retail grocery and pharmacy chain operating as a subsidiary of the grocery distributor and retailer SuperValu Inc. The company originated in 1899, when Frank Vernon Skiff and Frank Ross founded the Jewel Tea Company to supply condiments to the Chicago area from horse-drawn wagons. As the automobile gained in importance, the firm moved from wagons to motorized trucks to deliver its goods across the Midwest. It incorporated in Illinois in 1903 and changed its name to Jewel Companies, Inc., in 1966.
The enactment in the 1930s of the “Green River Ordinance,” which prohibited door-to-door solicitation, encouraged the company to move into the retail food business, and in 1932 it formed Jewel Food Stores, Inc., to acquire the grocery store business formerly owned by Loblaw Groceterias. The Jewel company flourished in the Midwest with a strong emphasis on customer service. In 1961 the company expanded into the retail drugstore business with the acquisition of the Osco Drug, Inc., drug chain. The company’s retail outlets included Jewel supermarkets, Osco drugstores, and White Hen Pantry convenience stores. After 1983 most Jewel and Osco stores were constructed under one roof, although they maintained separate operations. Renamed Jewel Companies, Inc., the company was purchased by the drug-and-grocery retailer American Stores Company in 1984. In 1999 Albertson’s acquired American Stores’ assets (including Jewel, Osco, Lucky Stores, Acme Markets, and Sav-on Drugs). After the grocery distributor and retailer SuperValu Inc. purchased Albertson’s in 2006, Jewel and Osco became wholly owned subsidiaries of SuperValu. In 2010 Jewel and Osco began formally operating as the unified entity Jewel-Osco.
