J. Walter Thompson Co.,,   American advertising agency that was long one of the largest such enterprises in the world. In 1980 it became a subsidiary of JWT Group Inc., a Delaware-based holding company.
The company grew out of one of the first advertising agencies, Carlton & Smith, established in 1864. Four years later William J. Carlton hired James Walter Thompson, age 20, as a bookkeeper. Thompson later became a solicitor of advertising and purchased the company from his employer in 1878. He renamed the agency after himself, and it was incorporated as J. Walter Thompson Co. in 1896. The agency soon became the exclusive buyer of advertising space in many American magazines and periodicals. This pioneering emphasis on magazine advertising proved highly profitable, and the company created the first “account executives” to supervise the advertising campaigns of specific customers. Under the leadership of Stanley Resor, who purchased the agency in 1916, J. Walter Thompson Co. pioneered a number of other advertising innovations, including the use of testimonials and fine photography in advertisements. The JWT Group was acquired by the WPP Group, a British marketing firm, in 1987.
