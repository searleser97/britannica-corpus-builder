Mellon Financial Corporation,  American bank holding company whose principal subsidiary, Mellon Bank, has been one of the largest regional banks in the country. Its headquarters are in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
The original bank, T. Mellon and Sons Bank, was founded in 1869 by Thomas Mellon (1813–1908), a native of Ireland. One of his four sons, Andrew W. Mellon (1855–1937), joined the business in 1874 and proved so capable that the elder Mellon transferred the bank’s ownership to him in 1882. With the bank as the cornerstone of his financial empire, Andrew Mellon (later treasury secretary in the Warren G. Harding, Calvin Coolidge, and Herbert Hoover administrations) helped establish Pittsburgh’s leading industrial companies, including the Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa) and Gulf Oil Company. In 1902 the bank was reorganized as Mellon National Bank and became a subsidiary of Andrew Mellon’s Union Trust Company. The two companies merged completely in 1946 to become Mellon National Bank and Trust Company. Andrew’s younger brother Richard B. Mellon and the latter’s son Richard K. Mellon successively headed the bank until 1967. The holding company was formed in 1972 and took the name Mellon Bank Corporation in 1984.
From the 1960s the Mellon Bank Corporation was a pioneer in the application of advanced data-processing technology to banking transactions. The company diversified into financial services beginning in the 1980s. In 1982 Mellon acquired the Girard Company, a major Philadelphia bank holding company, and in 1985 it merged with Commonwealth National Financial Corporation, a financial-services company based in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The Mellon Bank acquired the investment and money-management firm Boston Company, Inc., in 1993 and bought the Dreyfus Corporation, a large manager of mutual funds, in 1994. One year after its 1998 acquisition of United Bankshares Inc., the company changed its name to Mellon Financial Corporation to reflect the broader range of financial services. In 2006 Mellon agreed to be acquired by The Bank of New York Company, Inc.
