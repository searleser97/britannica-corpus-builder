Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT), Japanese Nihon Denshin Denwa Kōsha, also called Denden Kōsha,  Japanese telecommunications company that almost monopolizes Japan’s domestic electronic communications industry. It is Japan’s largest company and one of the largest companies in the world.
NTT was established in 1952 as a public corporation and the sole telecommunications company in Japan. NTT oversaw the vast expansion of the nation’s telephone network in the postwar period, with the number of telephone subscribers growing from 1.5 million in 1953 to 20 million by 1972. NTT was able to make telephone service available nationwide in 1977. Telephone service still provides almost 80 percent of the company’s income.
In 1968 the corporation also became involved in data communications. Because of its demand for increasingly sophisticated electronics equipment and its ability to utilize vast financial resources in the support of technology research and development, NTT was a major factor in Japan’s domination of the computer microchip industry. In the 1980s the company was developing non-telephone linkage systems for computer data systems and fibre-optic telecommunications systems. NTT was privatized in 1985, and from then on it was in competition with other telecommunications companies in Japan.
