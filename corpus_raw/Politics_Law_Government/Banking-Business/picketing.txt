Picketing,  Act by workers of standing in front of or near a workplace to call attention to their grievances, discourage patronage, and, during strikes, to discourage strikebreakers. Picketing is also used in non-work-related protests. The U.S. Norris-LaGuardia Act (1932) made it easier for workers to picket by restricting the use of court injunctions against strikes, but the Taft-Hartley Act (1947) outlawed mass picketing.
