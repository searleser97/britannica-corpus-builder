Depreciation,  in accounting, the allocation of the cost of an asset over its economic life. Depreciation covers deterioration from use, age, and exposure to the elements. It also includes obsolescenceâ€”i.e., loss of usefulness arising from the availability of newer and more efficient types of goods serving the same purpose. It does not cover losses from sudden and unexpected destruction resulting from fire, accident, or disaster.
Depreciation applies both to tangible property such as machinery and buildings and to intangibles of limited life such as leaseholds and copyrights. It does not apply to land. For convenience, depreciation accounts are usually kept for groups of assets with similar characteristics and working life.
The general rule of charging off a depreciable asset during its life does not determine what the charge will be each year. Straight-line, fixed-percentage, and, more rarely, annuity methods of depreciation (giving, respectively, constant, gradually decreasing, and gradually increasing charges) are standard. Sometimes charges vary with use (e.g., with the number of miles per year a truck is driven). Special rules allow depletion of nonreproducible capital (such as a body of ore being mined) for tax purposes to exceed original cost.
Basing depreciation on historical cost rather than on probable replacement cost and on arbitrary rules rather than on actual use has been practiced to establish definite tax liability and to standardize audits of accounts; in times of shifting price levels, however, such bases for measuring depreciation have proved especially imperfect.
