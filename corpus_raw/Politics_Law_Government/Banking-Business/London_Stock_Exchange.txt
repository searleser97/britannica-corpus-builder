London Stock Exchange (LSE),  a London marketplace for securities. After having long been situated closer to the Bank of England and the Royal Exchange, in 2004 the London Stock Exchange relocated elsewhere in the City of London to Paternoster Square. The market was formed in 1773 by several stockbrokers who had been doing business informally in neighbourhood coffeehouses. In 1801 a group of members raised money for the construction of a building in Capel Court, Bartholomew Lane, and rules for the exchange were established soon afterward; the rules subsequently have been amended several times. In 1973 the exchange merged with several regional stock exchanges in Great Britain, and in 1986 its operations were reorganized and an automated price-quotation system introduced.
The exchange became a public limited company, London Stock Exchange PLC, in 2001â€”the year of its bicentennial. In 2011 it was announced that the LSE and the TMX Group, owner of the Toronto Stock Exchange, had agreed to merge.
