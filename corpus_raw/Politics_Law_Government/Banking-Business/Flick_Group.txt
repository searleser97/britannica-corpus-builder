Flick Group, German Flick Gruppe, also called (after 1985) Feldmuehle Nobel AG,  former diversified industrial and manufacturing company founded in Germany in the early 1920s by Friedrich Flick, who rapidly gained control of a massive empire in both steel and coal. The end of World War II, however, found three-fourths of the Flick operations inside the Soviet zone of occupation and thus lost to the corporation. The Allied administration of occupied West Germany followed a course of decartelization and forced the firm to dispose of either its steel or its coal operations; Flick chose to sell the coal resources. Friedrich Flick himself was sentenced to seven years in prison for war crimes (charged with exploiting Soviet and other slave labourers in his mines and plants) in the Nürnberg trials.
The Flick Group made a remarkable recovery from its wartime losses. By the early 1980s the firm was the largest paper manufacturer in West Germany, was heavily involved in chemicals and steel engineering, and also was the owner of a major European insurance company. It had widespread foreign investments, including a substantial ownership percentage in the American chemical and retailing corporation W.R. Grace Company. The Flick Group became embroiled in a major scandal in the 1980s when one of its senior executives was charged with bribing high West German government officials to grant the firm large tax breaks on capital gains it had made in the 1970s.
For many years the Flick Group was the largest family-owned firm in West Germany. But in 1985 its sole owner, Friedrich Karl Flick, sold it to Deutsche Bank AG, which then converted the company to public ownership through stock issuances. The Flick Group’s various foreign holdings were sold separately, leaving the company’s core of industrial operations in a new public firm called Feldmuehle Nobel AG; over time Feldmuehle’s businesses were acquired by other companies.
