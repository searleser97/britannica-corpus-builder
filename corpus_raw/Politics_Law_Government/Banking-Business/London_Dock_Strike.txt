London Dock Strike,   (1889), influential strike by workers in the Port of London that won them the famous “dockers’ tanner” (a pay rate of sixpence per hour) and revitalized the British Trades Union movement.
Following a minor dispute at the South-West India Dock (Aug. 13, 1889), labour activists Ben Tillett, Tom Mann, and John Burns announced (August 19) the formation of a dockers’ union. From August 20 the entire Port of London was closed, and Burns led orderly processions of strikers throughout London. A crisis (August 29) caused by shortage of relief funds was averted by financial support organized in Australia; nearly £30,000 was hastily remitted, and this, with the £49,000 soon subscribed in Britain, assured the strike’s indefinite continuance. From September 5 the employers began negotiations, the principal mediator being the Roman Catholic archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal H.E. Manning. Agreement was reached on September 10; with their “tanner” and most other demands conceded, the dockers resumed work on September 16. Their success inspired the formation of many new unions of largely unskilled labourers, while membership of already-existing unions rose dramatically.
