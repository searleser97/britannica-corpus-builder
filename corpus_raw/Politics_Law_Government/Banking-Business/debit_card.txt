Debit card,  small card, similar to a credit card, offering means of paying for a purchase through transfer of funds from the purchaser’s bank account to the vendor. Financial institutions that process these transactions benefit from cheaper transaction costs (it is more expensive for banks to process transactions paid with checks) and immediate payment. Although the financial institution receives the credit immediately, the vendor is credited in the same way as in a credit card transaction—usually within a matter of days. Debit cards differ from stored-value cards (also known as smart cards), which simply subtract the transaction amount from cash value stored on the card.
