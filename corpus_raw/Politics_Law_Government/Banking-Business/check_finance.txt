Check, also spelled Cheque,  bill of exchange drawn on a bank and payable on demand; it has become the chief form of money in the domestic commerce of developed countries. As a written order to pay money, it may be transferred from one person to another by endorsement and delivery or, in certain cases, by delivery alone. Negotiability can be qualified by appropriate words, as with restrictive endorsements, or by the check form itself. Most checks are not paid in currency but by the debiting and crediting of bank deposits. Clearings are accomplished either by direct presentation, by correspondent banks, through local clearinghouses, or by central banks, such as the federal reserve banks in the United States.
A cashier’s check is issued by a bank against itself and is signed by the cashier or some other bank officer. It has unquestioned acceptability as exchange. A certified check is a depositor’s check that has been guaranteed by the bank upon which it is drawn and is so stamped. Traveler’s checks are cashier’s checks sold to travellers that require two signatures by the payee. One signature is placed on the check in the presence of an issuing agent; the other signature is for the purpose of identification and is placed on the check when it is cashed. Purchasers of traveller’s checks are guaranteed reimbursement by the issuers of the checks if the checks are lost or stolen.
