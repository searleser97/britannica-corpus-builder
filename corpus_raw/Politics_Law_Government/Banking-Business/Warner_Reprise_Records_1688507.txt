Hoping to find musical freedom, Johnny Mercer, the writer of “Moon River,” helped launch Capitol Records in 1942. Nineteen years later, Frank Sinatra, in search of musical freedom of his own, left Capitol and formed the Reprise label. In 1963 Reprise was sold to Warner Brothers, and, although the label continued to record Sinatra, it soon forswore 1950s swing-a-ding-dingness. If Reprise never had a distinctive sound, it did have a clear identity: West Coast hip, blue jeans, and Native American jewelry. Under the guidance of producers and artists-and-repertoire men Lenny Waronker and Ted Templeman, several artists came to embody this identity musically—especially Little Feat and the far more popular Doobie Brothers, who made an unanticipated but lucrative switch from country rock to rhythm and blues with the addition of singer Michael McDonald. James Taylor typified the new singer-songwriter mode with several best-selling albums for Warner Brothers, and Neil Young had enormous success with his tuneful After the Gold Rush (1970) for Reprise.
Warner/Reprise sold millions of albums by British heavy metal bands Black Sabbath and Deep Purple. However, it continued to support several cult artists who sold few records but gave the amalgamated company a sense of style, notably Ry Cooder and Randy Newman, both of whom gravitated to writing film scores. In 1977 came Rumours, the Fleetwood Mac album that drew together strains of Los Angeles music and the Los Angeles music business—the rich, lush sound of endless overdubs, the drugs, the hubris, the merry-go-round of partners, the spiritual turn of the lyrics, and the cascade of therapists. In the process it sold more than 25 million copies worldwide.
