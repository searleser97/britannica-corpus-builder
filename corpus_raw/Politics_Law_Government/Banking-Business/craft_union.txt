Craft union,  trade union combining workers who are engaged in a particular craft or skill but who may work for various employers and at various locations. Formed to improve wage levels and working conditions, craft unions were established in Britain and the United States in the middle of the 19th century. They derive their power from their control over the supply of skilled labour—a control that is maintained through licensing and apprenticeship arrangements. With such slogans as “One craft, one union,” a local craft union strives to organize all members of its trade (e.g., plumbers, electricians, bricklayers, ironworkers, carpenters, machinists, and printers). Some craft unions came to include skills not directly related to the original craft in which the union developed. For example, the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association was formed in 1962 by aircraft mechanics who sought greater recognition of their craft; the union has since been required to accept members who are custodians or baggage handlers in the airline industry. See industrial union.
