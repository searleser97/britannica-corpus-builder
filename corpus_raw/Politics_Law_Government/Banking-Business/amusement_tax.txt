Amusement tax,  impost on the general admission charges to recreational and entertainment events. The tax may be imposed on the admission charge or on the ownerâ€™s total admission receipts, but the pure amusement tax is almost always quoted separately and presumably shifted to the buyer of the ticket. Events sponsored by or for religious, educational, and other nonprofit organizations usually are exempted. Often, the tax on admission charges is an application of the general sales tax.
Some taxes, such as those on pool and billiard parlours and on racetracks, were originally imposed as sumptuary taxes, intended to discourage such enterprises. The common justification for singling out amusement for special taxation is that entertainment is not a necessity and that spending on recreation evidences more than ordinary taxpaying ability. Such views have been somewhat discredited by modern views that support activities that foster mental health.
