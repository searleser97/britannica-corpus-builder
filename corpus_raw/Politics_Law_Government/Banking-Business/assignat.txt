Assignat,  paper bill issued in France as currency from 1789 to 1796, during the French Revolution. A financial expedient on the part of the Revolutionary government, the increasing issuance of the assignats resulted in inflation.
In December 1789, to pay its immediate debts, the National Assembly issued the assignat as a bond bearing 5 percent interest, with the recently nationalized church lands as security. By September 1790 the Assembly made the assignat into a paper currency, and the amount in circulation was increased from 400,000,000 livres to 1,200,000,000. The initial effect of the paper currency was beneficial, stimulating economic growth and eliminating a money shortage. But a deep public distrust of paper money and the fear that the currency would be worthless if the uncertain Revolutionary regime collapsed soon caused the assignat to depreciate.
The outbreak of war with the other European powers in 1792 caused a further decline in the value of the assignat. In 1796 the assignats were replaced by the mandats territoraux (land warrants) at the rate of one mandat for 30 assignats. The failure of the mandat to gain public confidence forced the Directory to return to a metallic currency (February 4, 1797).
