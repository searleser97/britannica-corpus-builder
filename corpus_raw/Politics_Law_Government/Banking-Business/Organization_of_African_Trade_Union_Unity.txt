Organization of African Trade Union Unity, French Organisation de l’Unité Syndicale Africaine (OUSA),  labour organization founded in 1973 at Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on the initiative of the Organization of African Unity and replacing the former All-African Trade Union Federation (AATUF; founded in 1961) and the African Trade Union Confederation (ATUC; founded in 1962). The ATUC from its founding had encouraged member affiliation with other international union organizations, while the more-militant AATUF had rejected such affiliation as incompatible with the development of a Pan-African federation.
The OATUU includes some 70 affiliate national trade-union organizations from the more than 50 African countries that the group counts as its members. Its aims include building trade-union unity on the African continent, coordinating the action of the national union organizations under its fold, and supporting African workers and representing their interests. Its headquarters are in Accra, Ghana.
