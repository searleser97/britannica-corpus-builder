Alcan Aluminium Limited,   Canadian multinational company incorporated in 1928 (as Aluminium Limited) and now the largest Canadian industrial enterprise, operating in more than 100 countries. It has mining and refining operations for bauxite; smelting plants for aluminum; hydroelectric plants; fabricating plants for a wide variety of aluminum products; transportation operations; facilities for production and sale of industrial chemicals; and research and development laboratories. Head offices are in Montreal. The current name was adopted in 1966.
The company’s history traces to 1902, when the Northern Aluminum Company was incorporated as a Canadian subsidiary of the Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa). In 1925 the name was changed to Aluminium Company of Canada, Ltd., resulting in the Alcan trademark. In 1928 it was renamed Aluminium, reincorporated, and separated from its parent company, Alcoa, which transferred to it almost all of Alcoa’s assets then held outside the United States. In return, Alcoa’s stockholders received the common stock of Aluminium Limited. Major stockholders of the two companies continued to be identical until 1951, when a U.S. District Court compelled them to sell their stock in one or the other company in order to remove the appearance of collusive action. Most of the current shareholders of Alcan are Canadians. Once a major producer of raw materials, the company is now a major supplier of fabricated products.
