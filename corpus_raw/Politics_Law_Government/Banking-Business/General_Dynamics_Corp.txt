General Dynamics Corp.,  major American defense contractor. The company’s headquarters are in Falls Church, Va.
The original company, the Electric Boat Company, was founded in 1899 and built the Holland, the first submarine purchased by the U.S. Navy, in 1900. Electric Boat continued to build submarines and surface ships, and in 1954 it launched the Nautilus, the world’s first nuclear-powered submarine. The firm was incorporated under its present name in 1952.
 General Dynamics began to diversify into other defense industries after World War II and became a leading manufacturer of military aircraft in the 1950s. While continuing to build submarines, it also developed and manufactured military, commercial, and private aircraft; space vehicles; armoured vehicles; and advanced electronics and communications equipment. General Dynamics produced the F-16 fighter jet, the F-111 fighter bomber, and the M1 main battle tank. The company also became a major builder of liquid natural-gas tankers and was the prime contractor for the U.S. Navy’s Trident nuclear submarine program. 
Following the end of the Cold War, General Dynamics sold off its fighter aircraft, private aircraft, and missile-systems businesses in 1992 and its space systems business in 1994. The company then reorganized itself into two divisions: the Marine Group included Electric Boat and continued to make submarines of all types, as well as surface warships; while the Combat Systems Group made M1 tanks and other armoured vehicles. Another division, Information Systems and Technology, was created in 1998 and is focused on defense electronics. A majority of General Dynamics’ annual revenues continued to be derived from government contracts with the United States.
