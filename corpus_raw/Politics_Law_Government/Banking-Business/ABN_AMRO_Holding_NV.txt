ABN AMRO Holding NV,  holding company of the Dutch bank ABN AMRO Bank NV. Headquarters are in Amsterdam.
Its origins date to 1824 when King William I of the Netherlands issued a royal decree that established the Netherlands Trading Society (Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij; NHM) in order to facilitate trade between the Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies. In 1964 NHM merged with De Twentsche Bank to form the Algemene Bank Nederland (ABN), while the Amsterdamsche Bank and the Rotterdamsche Bank merged to become the Amsterdam-Rotterdam (AMRO) Bank. In 1991 both institutions united to become ABN AMRO, an international group offering a wide range of banking products and financial services. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, ABN AMRO engaged in a series of sales and acquisitions as it continued to expand both nationally and internationally, particularly in the area of private banking.
