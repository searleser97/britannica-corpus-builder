Varig, abbreviation of Empresa de Viação Aérea Rio Grandense (Portuguese: “Rio Grandense Air Transport Enterprise”),  Brazilian airline founded on May 7, 1927, with the assistance of a Berlin trading concern, Kondor Syndicat, which had begun flights in the state of Rio Grande do Sul the previous January. Thereafter, Varig opened several more intrastate routes. Major expansion did not begin until 1953, however, when the Brazilian government guaranteed Varig’s service from Rio de Janeiro to New York City (a service inaugurated two years later). In the 1970s Varig was granted a monopoly on international air travel, and by the late 20th century its route network covered the five continents of South America, North America, Europe, Africa, and Asia. In the 1960s the company absorbed a number of smaller Brazilian airlines, including Real (Redes Estaduais Aéreas) and Panair do Brasil. After losing its monopoly in 1991, Varig encountered financial difficulties, and in 2005 it filed for bankruptcy. The following year Varig was bought by an investment group that also owned VarigLog, a cargo business that was a former subsidiary of the airliner.
