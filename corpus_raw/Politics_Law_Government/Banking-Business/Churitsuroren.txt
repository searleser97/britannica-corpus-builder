Chūritsurōren, English Liaison Council of Neutral Labour Unions,  Japanese trade-union federation (1961–87) whose members were primarily employed in private enterprise. Although some of the individual member unions were identified with political parties, the federation itself was independent. Chūritsurōren often cooperated with the General Council of Japanese Trade Unions, Sōhyō, in economic matters; Sōhyō, which had ties to the Japan Socialist Party, was dissolved in 1989, when the entire labour movement was restructured.
