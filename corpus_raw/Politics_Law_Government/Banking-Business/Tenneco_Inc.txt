Tenneco Inc.,, formerly (1947–66) Tennessee Gas And Transmission Company,  diversified American industrial corporation, with major interests in natural-gas pipelines and the construction of heavy equipment. It was also formerly a large producer of petroleum. Headquarters are in Houston, Texas.
Tenneco was formed in 1943 as the Tennessee division of the Chicago Corporation to build a natural-gas pipeline from Texas to West Virginia. Shortly after World War II ended, the division was sold, and the new company was incorporated in 1947 as the Tennessee Gas & Transmission Company with founder Gardiner Symonds as its longtime president. With Symonds at the head, the company in addition began to distribute its gasoline in the South—under such trade names as Tenneco and Red Diamond—and heating oil in the North. The company assumed its present name in 1966.
Federal regulations on oil and gas pricing caused Symonds to expand into other business areas while retaining its large network of natural-gas pipelines. Among its other businesses are construction and farm equipment, shipbuilding, automotive equipment, packaging cartons and containers, and chemicals. Two-thirds of the company’s shipbuilding business comes from building and repairing nuclear-powered vessels for the U.S. Navy. In 1988 Tenneco sold off its considerable petroleum- and natural-gas-producing properties in order to concentrate on its diversified industrial operations.
