Dresdner Bank AG,  commercial bank based in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, with operations in more than 70 countries.
It was established in 1872 in Dresden as Dresdner Bank, and in 1884 its main office was relocated to Berlin. In 1952 the bank was split into three: Rhein-Main Bank AG, Hamburger Kreditbank AG, and Rhein-Ruhr Bank AG. The three were reunited as the present Dresdner Bank in 1957.
In addition to providing commercial banking and financial services, the bank is dominant in the financing of export and import transactions. The bank and its associated companies also offer services in money markets, foreign exchange, and the underwriting of securities.
In 1974 the bank combined with several European and South American banks to establish the Euro-Latinamerican Bank in London, which finances development projects in Latin America. In April 2000, Dresdner Bank and rival Deutsche Bank AG canceled their plans to merge into what would have been one of the worldâ€™s largest banking organizations. Dresdner was instead acquired in 2001 by Allianz AG, an insurance and financial services conglomerate in Munich, Germany.
