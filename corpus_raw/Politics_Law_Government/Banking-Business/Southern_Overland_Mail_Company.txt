Southern Overland Mail Company,   organization awarded (1858) the U.S. government contract to deliver mail to the Pacific coast. The company operated a 25-day, semiweekly stagecoach run along a route from St. Louis, Mo., through El Paso, Texas, and Tucson, New Mexico Territory, to San Francisco.
With the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, the southern route was abandoned, and the government contract was awarded to the Central Overland California and Pikes Peak Express, which operated through Salt Lake City, Utah. The Central Overland was purchased in 1862 by Ben Holladay, and the Holladay Overland Stage Company was sold to Wells, Fargo and Company in 1866. The companyâ€™s stagecoach operations were maintained until the completion of the first transcontinental railroad in 1869.
