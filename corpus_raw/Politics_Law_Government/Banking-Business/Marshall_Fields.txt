Marshall Field’s,  former department store chain whose flagship store on State Street in Chicago was for a time the largest in the world, comprising 73 acres of floor space and having larger book, china, shoe, and toy departments than any other department store of its time. In 2006 Marshall Field’s became part of the Macy’s chain and was renamed.
The original store, P. Palmer & Co., was founded in 1852 by Chicago entrepreneur Potter Palmer. In 1865 Palmer invited Marshall Field (1834–1906) and Levi Zeigler Leiter (1834–1904) to form the retailing partnership of Field, Palmer & Leiter. Field took control of the partnership in 1881 and introduced many merchandising concepts that were revolutionary at the time. Placing strong emphasis on total customer service, Field made his store a complete shopping world, providing virtually every product and service routinely needed—as well as many that were not so routine. He also originated the concept of an in-store restaurant for shoppers.
The firm Marshall Field & Company, Inc., incorporated in 1901, continued to expand after Field’s death in 1906. Over the years the company added more Marshall Field’s stores and purchased department store chains in other parts of the United States. It also built the Chicago Merchandise Mart in 1930 (sold in 1945) and entered the textile-manufacturing business (interests sold in 1953). In 1982 Marshall Field & Company was acquired by BATUS Inc., an American subsidiary of London-based tobacco conglomerate B.A.T Industries PLC. The Dayton Hudson Corporation (later Target Corporation) purchased Marshall Field & Co. from BATUS in 1990. In 2004 Target sold the Marshall Field’s department store chain to the May Department Stores Company, another American retailing corporation, and in 2005 the May Company was acquired by Federated Department Stores, Inc., which operated Macy’s.
