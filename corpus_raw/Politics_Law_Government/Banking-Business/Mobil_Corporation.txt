Mobil Corporation,  former American petroleum and chemical company that joined with Exxon in 1999 to form Exxon Mobil Corporation.
Mobil Oil’s origins date to the 19th century. One predecessor, Vacuum Oil Company, was founded in 1866 and, after 1882, became part of the Standard Oil Company and Trust. Another predecessor was Standard Oil Company of New York (Socony), established by the trust in 1882. Both companies became independent in 1911 when the U.S. Supreme Court dissolved the Standard Oil combine, but the two merged in 1931 to form Socony-Vacuum Corporation. The name was changed in 1934 to Socony-Vacuum Oil Company, Inc., in 1955 to Socony Mobil Oil Company, Inc., and then in 1966 to Mobil Oil Corporation.
In an effort to diversify beyond its oil holdings, Mobil in 1974 acquired 54 percent of the voting shares of Marcor Inc. (then the parent company of Container Corporation of America and Montgomery Ward & Co.), and two years later Marcor merged into Mobil. Mobil sold the Container Corporation of America in 1986 and sold Montgomery Ward & Co. in 1988, thus clearing the way for Mobil to concentrate on its core businesses of petroleum extraction, processing, and distribution. After the merger 10 years later that created Exxon Mobil, all products bearing the Mobil brand name retained the company’s long-standing logo of Pegasus, the winged horse.
