Grameen Bank,  Bangladeshi bank founded by economist Muhammad Yunus as a means of providing small loans to poor individuals (see microcredit). In 2006 Grameen and Yunus were awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace.
The Grameen (Bengali: “Rural”) model, devised by Yunus in 1976, is based on groups of five prospective borrowers who meet regularly with Grameen Bank field managers. Typically, two of the five prospective borrowers are granted loans. If, after a probationary time period, the first two borrowers meet the terms of repayment, then loans are granted to the remaining group members. Peer pressure acts as a replacement for traditional loan collateral. Grameen became an independent bank in 1983; headquartered in Dhaka, Bangladesh, it has more than 2,200 branches in the country. The Grameen model has come to symbolize an efficient means of helping the poor by providing them with opportunities to help themselves. More than 97 percent of Grameen’s loan recipients have been women.
