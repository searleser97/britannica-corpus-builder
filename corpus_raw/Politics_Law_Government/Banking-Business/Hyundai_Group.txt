It exports cars and trucks throughout the Far East. The company moved into the shipbuilding market in 1973 with the formation of Hyundai Heavy Industries, which produces a variety of vessels, ranging from custom yachts to supertankers. The Hyundai Group also includes divisions that build and export diesel and electric locomotives, freight cars, and passenger coaches for the railroad industry, and offshore drilling and extraction equipment to the oil industry.
