NYSE Amex Equities, formerly called American Stock Exchange (Amex),  major U.S. stock exchange that also handles trades in options, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), corporate bonds, and other investment vehicles. Trading on NYSE Amex Equities—originally known as the “Curb” (because its transactions took place outdoors during much of its existence)—is believed to have started about 1849 in New York City. By 1908 it was known as the New York Curb Agency, and it was called the New York Curb Exchange from 1929 to 1953, at which time it changed its name to the American Stock Exchange (Amex). In 2009 it was renamed NYSE Amex Equities. The market first moved indoors in 1921. For a number of years it was a marketplace for securities not considered reputable enough for listing on the New York Stock Exchange, but it came to be considered an equally respectable exchange with its own listing requirements for securities and admissions requirements for members.
The Amex was part of the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) from 1998 to 2004, when ownership of the Amex returned to private hands. Unlike many other exchanges around the world, it did not relinquish floor trading in favour of computer trading, and, at the beginning of the 21st century, the Amex was the second largest floor-based exchange in the United States. The exchange was a key marketplace for trading in options, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and closed-end funds. In 2008 the Amex was acquired by NYSE Euronext, the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, and its name was subsequently changed to NYSE Amex Equities. In 2011 NYSE Euronext agreed to merge with Deutsche Börse, operator of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.
