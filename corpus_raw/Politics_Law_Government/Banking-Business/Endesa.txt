Endesa, acronym of Empresa Nacional de Electricidad SA,  Spanish energy company that is one of the largest private conglomerates in the world. Headquarters are in Madrid.
Endesa’s activities are aimed at generating, transporting, distributing, and selling electrical energy and related services. The company was founded by the Spanish government in 1944, and in 1945 the Compostilla power station was built in the town of Ponferrada in northwestern Spain. In 1988 the Spanish government began reducing its stake in the company, a process that ended in 1998 with full privatization of the company. In July 1999 the process of corporate restructuring was completed, and company shares were traded for the first time on the Spanish stock exchanges as well as in New York. Endesa is the main energy company in Spain and has a significant presence elsewhere in Europe; it also operates in several Latin American countries.
In 2007 Endesa was jointly acquired by the Spanish conglomerate Acciona and the Italian energy company Enel. Two years later Enel purchased Acciona’s stake, thereby taking full control of Endesa.
