The Chase Manhattan Corporation,  former American holding company that merged with J.P. Morgan & Co. in 2000 to form J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.
The firm originated in the final days of the 18th century. On April 2, 1799, at the urging of such civic leaders as Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton (later noted rivals), the New York state legislature chartered the Manhattan Company to build a water supply system for New York City. The original capital ($2 million) was so large that the directors quickly voted to use surplus funds to open an “office of discount and deposit,” and on September 1, 1799, the Bank of the Manhattan Company was opened at 40 Wall Street. In 1808 the company sold its waterworks to the city and turned completely to banking. Although growth was steady, the bank’s real expansion began after the onset of the 20th century. In 1918 it merged with the Bank of the Metropolis and thus acquired the first of many branch offices. In 1920 it merged with the Merchants’ National Bank of the City of New York (founded 1803, with Hamilton’s promotion), and in 1929 it acquired the International Acceptance Bank, Inc. (founded 1921), thus venturing into foreign-trade financing.
The Chase National Bank was organized September 12, 1877, by John Thompson (1802–91), who named the bank in honour of the late U.S. Treasury secretary Salmon P. Chase. (Thompson had earlier helped found the First National Bank, a predecessor of Citibank and, later, CitiGroup.) Chase National’s growth was phenomenal, and by 1921 it had become the second largest national bank in the United States, without benefit of mergers. Then there followed a long series of mergers: Metropolitan National Bank (1921), Mechanics and Metals National Bank (1926), Mutual Bank (1927), Garfield National Bank (1929), National Park Bank (1929), Equitable Trust Company, including Seaboard National Bank (1929), and Interstate Trust Company (1930). Such mergers resulted in a proliferation of branches and extensive foreign affiliations.
On March 31, 1955, Chase National Bank (then the nation’s 3rd largest bank) and the Bank of the Manhattan Company (the 15th largest) merged to form The Chase Manhattan Bank. Its reorganization as the Chase Manhattan Corporation in 1969 reflected a general movement in American banking to establish holding companies to own banking operations that were separate from other operations such as finance companies, which were by law excluded from the purview of banking.
In 1996 The Chase Manhattan Corporation merged with the nation’s second largest bank, the New York-based Chemical Banking Corporation, to form what was then the largest bank in the United States. The merged bank kept the name The Chase Manhattan Corporation. Chase Manhattan’s December 2000 merger with investment bank J.P. Morgan created a diverse financial firm, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., with leadership in retail banking, investment banking, and financial services.
