Mizuho Financial Group, Inc.,  Japanese bank holding company, one of the largest in the world in terms of assets, which exceeded $1 billion when it was founded. Mizuho originated in September 2000 with the mergers of Dai-Ichi Kangyō Bank, Fuji Bank, and the Industrial Bank of Japan. Losses at Mizuho and other Japanese banks, stemming largely from loan write-offs, were criticized as contributing to weakness in Japan’s economy at the start of the 21st century.
