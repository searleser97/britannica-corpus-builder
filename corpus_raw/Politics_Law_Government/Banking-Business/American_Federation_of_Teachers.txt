American Federation of Teachers (AFT),  U.S. trade union for classroom educators, school personnel, and public employees. It was formed in 1916 as an affiliate of the American Federation of Labor (see AFL–CIO). Through collective bargaining and teachers’ strikes, it has obtained for its members better wages, pensions, sick leaves, academic freedom, and other benefits. Under the leadership of Albert Shanker (1928–97; pres. 1974–97), it instituted national certification tests and other reforms. See also National Education Association.
