Gift tax,  a levy imposed on gratuitous transfers of propertyâ€”i.e., those made without compensation. Provisions for such taxes are common in national tax systems.
In the tax systems of many nations, gift taxes are integrated to some degree with an estate (inheritance) tax. The relationship stems not only from the fact that gifts and bequests share the quality of gratuity but also from the practical consideration that gifts are often resorted to as a means of avoiding estate taxes. Where the two are more or less integrated, they may be thought of as constituting an accessions tax.
Gift taxes are typically of little significance in the generation of revenue. They serve a symbolic function in reminding the parties to a transfer of property that the state (or other municipality) creates the legal structure within which such transfers are possible. A more important function, and in some nations the explicit rationale for gift taxes, is to stem the use of gifts as a means of avoiding estate taxes.
Exemptions from the tax are commonly granted for gifts made to charitable, educational, or other qualifying institutions. Such exemptions are expressions of social policy.
