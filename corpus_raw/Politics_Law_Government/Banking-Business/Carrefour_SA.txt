Carrefour SA, (French: “Crossroads”)  French company that is one of the world’s largest retailers. Headquarters are in Paris.
Carrefour operates thousands of stores under various names, including the hypermarket Carrefour, the supermarket Champion, convenience stores Shopi and Marché Plus, discount stores Dia and Ed, and the cash-and-carry store Promocash, in dozens of countries around the world. The first Carrefour supermarket was founded in 1963 in Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois, outside of Paris. By 1973 Carrefour’s business had expanded to Belgium, Switzerland, Italy, Great Britain, and Spain. In 1988 the hypermarket concept was exported to the United States, and the company’s first U.S. hypermarket was created in Philadelphia. However, bad publicity, limited selection, and a labour strike all led it to cease operations in 1993. In 1989 the company’s first hypermarket opened in Taiwan. Carrefour entered the Mexican market in 1993, Poland in 1997, and the Czech Republic in 1998. Also in 1998 it acquired the French supermarket chain Comptoir Modernes, which operated 800 stores, and in 1999 it merged with Promodès, which had more than 6,000 stores in Europe. These acquisitions secured a leading position for Carrefour in the European retail industry.
In the early 21st century the company engaged in a series of sales and acquisitions, maintaining a strong international presence. Throughout the first decade of the 21st century, Carrefour was the world’s second largest retailer by revenue, after Wal-Mart. In 2009 it launched Carrefour Discount, a lower-priced line of store-brand products, thereby increasing its competitiveness.
