Grémio, (Portuguese: ‘‘guild’’)   any of the organized guilds that were founded during the Moorish occupation of Portugal (714–1249) by men who worked in the same craft and who generally lived on the same street in a given city. Each guild selected a patron saint, usually one who had shared its profession, and designed a banner with the saint depicted on it. For this reason, guilds were popularly known as bandeiras (“banners”). In the 15th century,  with the development of overseas trades, the autonomous guilds became more closely linked to the royal provincial governments and councils.
Jurisdiction over all the guilds was in the hands of the Casa dos Vinte e Quatro (“House of Twenty-four”), which was composed of two elected representatives from each of 12 guilds. Members of the house, who had to be 40 years old, were elected by a vote of two-thirds of the masters of their respective guilds.
With the passing of the guilds’ autonomous status, they came to be used as sources of military draftees for the kings of Portugal. The guilds also became influential in the decision making of the Cortes (parliament).
