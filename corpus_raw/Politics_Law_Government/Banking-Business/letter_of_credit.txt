Letter of credit,  order from a bank to a bank or other party abroad authorizing payment of money (up to a specified limit) to a person named in the letter. A letter of credit, unlike a bill of exchange (q.v.), is not negotiable but is cashable only by the paying bank.
The two main classes of letters of credit are commercial and traveller’s. Commercial letters of credit are often used by exporters and others who wish proof that they will be paid before they ship goods or wish to minimize delay in payment. Traveller’s letters of credit are issued for the convenience of foreign travellers and answer the same purpose as traveller’s checks.
