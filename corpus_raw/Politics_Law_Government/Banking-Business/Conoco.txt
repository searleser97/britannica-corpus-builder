Conoco, in full Continental Oil Company,  former American petroleum company founded in 1875 as the Continental Oil and Transportation Company in Ogden, Utah. It became part of ConocoPhillips through a merger with the Phillips Petroleum Company in 2002.
In 1885 it was reincorporated—with the new name, Continental Oil Company—as part of the nationwide Standard Oil trust (see Standard Oil Company and Trust). In its early years its chief operations were marketing oil and related products, primarily in the Rocky Mountain area and in California. In 1913, two years after the U.S. Supreme Court dissolved the Standard Oil combine, the company was again independently incorporated. From 1913 to 1929 Continental Oil evolved into a fully integrated oil company. Its activities ranged from production to marketing, with operations, including filling stations, in most states west of the Mississippi River.
By 1929 Conoco had 1,800 producing wells and was selling half the gasoline consumed in the Rocky Mountain states. In that year it merged with Marland Oil Company (founded 1917), with wells and marketing operations from Oklahoma to Maryland. After World War II, Conoco acquired fields or refineries in Louisiana, Canada, Libya, Dubai, the North Sea, and Indonesia. In 1966 it acquired Consolidation Coal Company, the second largest coal company in the United States, and shortly thereafter began venturing into uranium and copper mining. Later diversifications included chemicals, plastics, and fertilizer businesses. In 1981 it was acquired by E.I. Du Pont de Nemours & Company and was reorganized as the Continental Group. In addition to petroleum products, the group maintained businesses in coal, other ores, and chemicals. Conoco split from Du Pont in 1998 and operated as an independent company until its 2002 merger with Phillips Petroleum, which formed ConocoPhillips.
