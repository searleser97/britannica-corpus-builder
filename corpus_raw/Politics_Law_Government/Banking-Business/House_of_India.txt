House of India, also called House Of Guinea, House Of Guinea And Mina, or House Of Mina, Portuguese Casa Da India, Casa Da Guiné, Casa De Guiné E Mina, or Casa Da Mina,  15th-century Portuguese establishment that managed the trade in products from overseas colonies. It was called House of Guinea because it began by processing products from Guinea. Originally housed in a warehouse at Lagos in southern Portugal, it was reestablished in Lisbon with the death of Prince Henry the Navigator (1460). As trade from São Jorge da Mina (now Elmina, Ghana) on the African Gold Coast increased, it became known as the House of Guinea and Mina.
Until 1499, the House of Guinea represented, in embryonic form, a colonial ministry in Portugal, in charge of storing merchandise, collecting duty on incoming goods, maintaining the Portuguese merchant fleet, and arranging shipping schedules. Portugal’s overseas trade grew tremendously as contact with the Orient was established after Vasco da Gama rounded the Cape of Good Hope in 1497–98. The establishment was renamed House of India and subsequently divided into mesas (boards) to handle the spice trade, finances, ship scheduling and maintenance, training of seamen, documentation and correspondence, and legal and juridical matters. It later also controlled the colonization of Brazil and eventually evolved into the government colonial ministry.
