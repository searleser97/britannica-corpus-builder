Montgomery Ward & Co.,  American e-commerce company that offers such general merchandise as furniture, tools, home appliances, and clothing. It was founded in Chicago in August 1872 by Aaron Montgomery Ward as a mail-order business. Headquarters are in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.
Ward started the company in 1872 with $2,400 capital and the aim of buying large quantities of merchandise wholesale and then selling it directly to farmers in rural areas without the help of retail intermediaries. Such an operation would provide goods to farmers at low prices but still yield Ward acceptable profits. To accomplish this, Ward began distributing the world’s first mail-order catalog (initially a single sheet listing goods and prices) and backed up his sales with a money-back guarantee. Both the company’s sales and the number of items in its catalog grew quickly from the mid-1870s on. Ward’s two partners in the original mail-order venture withdrew during the panic of 1873, and he brought in his brother-in-law George Robinson Thorne (1837–1918). In 1889 they converted their partnership into a corporation, privately held, and enjoyed good sales despite the panic of 1893—until a new competitor, Sears, Roebuck and Company (founded 1893), began outdistancing Montgomery Ward & Co. in advertising, merchandising, and sales, never yielding its leading position thereafter.
Montgomery Ward opened its first retail stores in 1926. By 1930 there were 556 of them across the country, and retail sales exceeded catalog sales. In 1968 Montgomery Ward merged with Container Corporation of America; the resultant holding company was named Marcor Inc. In 1974 Mobil Oil Corporation bought 54 percent of the voting shares of Marcor, and two years later Marcor merged into the new Mobil Corporation. In 1985 Montgomery Ward ended its 113-year-old mail-order catalog business in order to concentrate on its retail operations. Mobil Corporation sold Montgomery Ward in 1988, and, although the latter attempted to again became an independent corporation, it was purchased by a subsidiary of General Electric.
In the 1990s Montgomery Ward faced stiff competition from new discount retailers such as Target and Wal-Mart, and it filed for bankruptcy in 1997. Although it attempted to modernize its stores, the company continued to suffer losses. In December 2000 it announced that it was going out of business, and in 2001 it closed its remaining stores. After being acquired by a catalog marketer, Montgomery Ward was relaunched as an online company in 2004.
