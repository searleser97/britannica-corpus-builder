Bear market,  in securities and commodities trading, a declining market. A bear is an investor who expects prices to decline and, on this assumption, sells a borrowed security or commodity in the hope of buying it back later at a lower price, a speculative transaction called selling short. The term bear may derive from the proverb about “selling the bearskin before one has caught the bear” or perhaps from selling when one is “bare” of stock. Compare bull market.
