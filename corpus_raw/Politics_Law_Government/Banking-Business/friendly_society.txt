Friendly society,  mutual-aid organization formed voluntarily by individuals to protect members against debts incurred through illness, death, or old age. Friendly societies arose in the 17th and 18th centuries and were most numerous in the 19th century.
Friendly societies had their origins in the burial societies of ancient Greek and Roman artisans. In the Middle Ages the guilds of Europe and England extended the idea of mutual assistance to other circumstances of distress, such as illness. The friendly societies went a step further by attempting to define the magnitude of the risk against which it was intended to provide and how much the members should contribute to meet that risk. Offshoots of the friendly societies include trade unions, fraternal orders (such as the International Order of Odd Fellows), and life insurance companies. Today some insurance companies in the United Kingdom and in other countries of the Commonwealth still refer to themselves as friendly societies.
