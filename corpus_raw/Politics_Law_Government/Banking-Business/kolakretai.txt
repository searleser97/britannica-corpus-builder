Kōlakretai,  Athenian financial administrators of the 6th and 5th centuries bce. Their title (“collectors of legs”) indicates their original function as collectors of animal sacrifices. In the 6th century bce they managed the Athenian treasury and after the reforms of Cleisthenes (c. 508) were assisted by the apodektai (receivers). The office of kōlakretes, reported by Aristotle to have existed in the time of Solon (early 6th century), had probably been established before that. The office is believed to have been abolished late in the 5th century.
