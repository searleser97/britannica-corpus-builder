Nonimportation Agreements,  (1765â€“75), in U.S. colonial history, attempts to force British recognition of political rights through application of economic pressure. In reaction to the Stamp Act (1765) and the Townshend Acts (1767), colonial nonimportation associations were organized by Sons of Liberty and Whig merchants to boycott English goods. In each case, British merchants and manufacturers suffered curtailed trade with the colonies and exerted the anticipated pressure on Parliament. When the acts were subsequently repealed, the boycotts collapsed. After the Intolerable Acts of 1774, the first Continental Congress immediately provided for both nonimport and nonexport committees. Britain had developed new markets in Europe, however, and the expected influence on Parliament did not materialize. For 10 years nonimportation was the main weapon employed by the colonists in their unsuccessful attempt to win their demands from the mother country by peaceful means.
