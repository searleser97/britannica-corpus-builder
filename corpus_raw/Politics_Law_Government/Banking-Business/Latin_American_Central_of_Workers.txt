Latin American Central of Workers, Spanish Central Latinoamericana de Trabajadores,   (CLAT), regional  Christian Democrat trade union federation linked to the World Confederation of Labour (WCL). Its affiliated member groups represent some 10,000,000 workers in more than 35 Latin-American and Caribbean countries and territories. Its headquarters are in Caracas, Venez. From its founding in 1954 until 1971 it was known as the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unionists (Confederación Latinoamericana de Sindicalistas Cristianos [CLASC]). 
The group’s origins can be traced to the efforts of the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions (now the WCL) to expand its influence beyond Europe to the Western Hemisphere. The new federation’s organizing efforts in Latin America were directed both at national unions with a Christian orientation and at Christiam Democratic groups working within other unions. CLASC did not begin to grow significantly until the 1960s, when it became increasingly hostile toward the Interamerican Regional Organization of Workers (Organización Regional Interamericana de Trabajadores), which it considered to be dominated by the United States. Although CLASC claimed to be a more representative Latin-American group, a large portion of its financing has come from Roman Catholic union groups in Europe.
