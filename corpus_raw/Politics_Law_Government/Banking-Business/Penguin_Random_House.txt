Penguin Random House,  publishing house formed by the merger of Penguin and Random House in 2013. It is one of the world’s largest book publishers. Headquarters are in New York City.
Random House was founded by Americans Bennett Cerf and Donald S. Klopfer in 1925. As it grew, it published the works of many successful and prestigious writers and gathered under its corporate roof many other firms, including Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. (acquired 1960), Pantheon Books (1961), Ballantine Books (1973), Fawcett Books (1982), and the Crown Publishing Group (1988). It was itself bought several times before becoming in 1998 a division of one of the world’s largest media companies, Bertelsmann AG.
In 1935 Allen Lane established Penguin Books in London as a publisher of inexpensive paperbacks. Six years later the children’s imprint Puffin was launched. In 1946 Penguin debuted its popular classics series, and a modern classics line followed in 1961. After being purchased by Pearson Longman in 1970, Penguin acquired a number of firms, notably Frederick Warne (1983), New American Library/Dutton Books (1986), and the Putnam Berkley Group (1996).
In 2012 it was announced that Penguin and Random House would merge, with Bertelsmann holding a majority stake. The deal was finalized the following year.
