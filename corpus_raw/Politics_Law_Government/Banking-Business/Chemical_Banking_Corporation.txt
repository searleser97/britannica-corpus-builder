Chemical Banking Corporation,  former American bank holding company that merged with The Chase Manhattan Corporation in 1996.
The holding companyâ€™s principal subsidiary was Chemical Bank, which was chartered in 1824 in New York City as a division of the New York Chemical Manufacturing Company. Manufacturing activities were dropped in 1832. In 1844 the company was reconstituted as a state bank, and the chemical business was dropped. After successive mergers and name changes, the bank assumed the name Chemical Bank in 1969, when it became part of the holding company Chemical New York Corporation. The corporation acquired Texas Commerce Bancshares, Inc., in 1987. Its 1991 merger with Manufacturers Hanover Corporation represented one of the largest U.S. bank mergers up to that time. The merged company became the Chemical Banking Corporation.
In 1996 the firm, which was by then the second-largest bank in the United States, merged with another New York bank, The Chase Manhattan Corporation, to form what became the largest bank in the nation. Although the Chemical Banking Corporation had been the larger partner in the merger, the resulting firm was called The Chase Manhattan Corporation. Chase Manhattan merged with J.P. Morgan & Co. in December 2000 to form J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.
