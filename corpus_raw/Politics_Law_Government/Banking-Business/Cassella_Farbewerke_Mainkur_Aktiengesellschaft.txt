Cassella Farbewerke Mainkur Aktiengesellschaft,   (German: Cassella Dyeworks Mainkur Limited-liability Company), German chemical corporation founded in 1789 by Leopold Cassella (1766–1847) in Frankfurt and today a subsidiary of Hoechst Aktiengesellschaft (q.v.).
From 1789 to 1870 the company dealt only in the import and selling of coloured woods and natural dyestuffs; in the latter year it took up the manufacture of dyestuffs. Although the company underwent a series of name changes, it was known as Leopold Cassella & Co. when, in 1904, it merged with Farbewerke Hoeschst (Hoechst Dyeworks). In 1925, when Hoechst joined the new chemical cartel, IG Farben (q.v.), Cassella reasserted its independence and was not absorbed by the cartel until 1937. After World War II, in the dissolution of IG Farben, Cassella again became independent (under its current name)—but only briefly, for by 1970 Hoechst AG had purchased a controlling interest in Cassella.
Cassella products include dyes; auxiliary materials for the textile, paper, and leather industries; raw materials for paints; synthetic resins for laminated plastic sheeting; and pharmaceuticals.
