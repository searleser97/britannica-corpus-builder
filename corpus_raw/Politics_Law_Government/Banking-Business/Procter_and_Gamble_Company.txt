Procter & Gamble Company,  major American manufacturer of soaps, cleansers, and other household products. Headquarters are in Cincinnati, Ohio.
The company was formed in 1837 when William Procter, a British candlemaker, and James Gamble, an Irish soapmaker, merged their businesses in Cincinnati. The chief ingredient for both products was animal fat, which was readily available in the hog-butchering centre of Cincinnati. The company supplied soap and candles to the Union Army during the American Civil War and sold even more of these products to the public when the war was over. Among its early products were Ivory soap, introduced in 1879, Crisco shortening (1911), Tide, the first synthetic laundry detergent (1946), and Joy, the first liquid synthetic detergent (1949). In 1932 Procter & Gamble introduced the radio audience to “The Puddle Family,” the first “soap opera,” so called because of the sponsor.
Over succeeding years the company extended it product lines to include toothpaste, coffee, tea, and baking mixes. By the early 21st century Procter & Gamble marketed products in several major areas: health and wellness (prescription medications, digestive aids, mouthwashes, toothbrushes, and toothpastes); house and home (cleaning products, detergents, paper towels, coffee, and snack foods); personal and beauty (fragrances, deodorants, cosmetics, shaving supplies, and hair colour); baby and family (diapers and tissue, cleansing products, and moisturizers); and pet care, including pet foods. The company has long been one of the leading American national advertisers, as well as one of the leading issuers of free samples and discount coupons.
