Champion International Corporation,  former American forest products enterprise engaged in the manufacture of building materials, paper, and packaging materials. It was acquired by a competitor, International Paper Company, in 2000.
The company was founded in 1937 as U.S. Plywood Corporation in a consolidation of three smaller plywood companies. In 1967 this company merged with Champion Papers, Inc., to become U.S. Plywood–Champion Papers, Inc., and in 1972 the corporate name was changed to Champion International. Toward the end of the 20th century, a significant portion of Champion’s raw goods came from the company’s timberland holdings in the United States, Brazil, and Canada. These forests, representing nearly 3.5 million acres (1,416,399 hectares), supplied about half the wood for Champion’s sawmills, paper mills, and packaging plants.
In the late 1960s Champion diversified its product line by acquiring companies that made carpets, furniture, and ornamental iron. But in the early 1970s Champion sold most of these companies to refocus business on wood products. In 1977 Champion acquired Hoerner Waldorf, the fourth-largest American producer of paper bags and boxes. By the time Champion was sold to International Paper in 2000, a bidding war with Finnish paper company UPM had raised Champion’s purchase price to $7.3 billion.
