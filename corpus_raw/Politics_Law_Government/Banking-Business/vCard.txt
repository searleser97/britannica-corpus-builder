vCard,  electronic business card that automates the exchange of personal information typically found on a traditional business card. The vCard is a file that contains the userâ€™s basic business or personal data (name, address, phone number, URLs, etc.) in a variety of formats such as text, graphics, video clips, and audio clips. It can be attached to an e-mail or exchanged between computers or on the Internet, where, for example, the user can drag-and-drop his or her vCard to a registration or order form on a Web page so that it can automatically complete the form. It is used in such applications as voice mail, Web browsers, call centres, video conferencing, and smart cards.
