Law of Leptines,  (354 bc), ancient Athenian tax measure, subject of an early speech of the orator Demosthenes. The law, named for the man who proposed it, was backed by the Athenian statesman Aristophon; it sought to raise money for the state by eliminating hereditary tax exemptions granted to certain families for their public services. Demosthenes opposed it in his oration “Against the Law of Leptines.”
