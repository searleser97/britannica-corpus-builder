Imperial Chemical Industries PLC (ICI),  major British corporation that was founded in 1926 as Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd. to amalgamate four major British chemical companies: Brunner, Mond & Co. Ltd., Nobel Industries Ltd., United Alkali Company Ltd., and British Dyestuffs Corporation Ltd. Between World Wars I and II, ICI was a major competitor of Germany’s IG Farben, a cartel formed in 1925 and dissolved by the Allies after World War II. By the late 1970s ICI ranked below all three successors to IG Farben (Hoechst, BASF, and Bayer corporations) in terms of sales but was still the largest chemical concern in the United Kingdom. ICI’s headquarters were in London.
ICI’s constituent companies in 1926 produced chemicals, dyes, explosives, fertilizers, fibres, nonferrous metals, and paints, and the group went on to produce a wider range of chemicals, paints, pharmaceuticals, synthetic fibres (especially polyesters and nylon), and plastics. In 1993 ICI split off its drug, pesticide, and specialty chemical concerns into a new corporation named Zeneca Group PLC (which merged in 1999 with the Swedish company Astra AB to become AstraZeneca). The parent company continued to produce industrial polymers and other chemicals, paints, and explosives. In 1997 ICI bought the specialty chemicals business of Unilever. However, that acquisition placed the company about four billion pounds in debt. ICI then sold off much of its business until it was left with the adhesive and starch company National Starch and the paint brand Dulux. The Dutch company AkzoNobel bought ICI in 2008, sold National Starch to the German company Henkel, and absorbed the remainder of the company into its own operations.
