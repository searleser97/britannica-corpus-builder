Tattersalls,  horse auction mart, founded in London by Richard Tattersall (1724â€“95). The first premises occupied were near Hyde Park Corner, then in the outskirts of London. Tattersalls became a rendezvous for sporting and betting men, including the prince of Wales (later King George IV). The business remained in the hands of the Tattersall family until the 20th century. In 1865 it was moved to Knightsbridge, and since 1965 the company has held bloodstock auctions at Park Paddocks, Newmarket. In 1988 it also began holding auctions at Old Fairyhouse in County Meath, Ireland. The restaurants and grounds at both locations are also used for parties, weddings, and corporate events.
