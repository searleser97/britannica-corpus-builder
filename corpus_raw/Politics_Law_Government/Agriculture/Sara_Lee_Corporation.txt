Sara Lee Corporation,  major American producer of frozen baked goods, fresh and processed meats, coffee, hosiery and knitwear, and household and shoe-care products. It is headquartered in Downers Grove, Ill.
The company was incorporated in 1941 as the South Street Company and went through several name changes before it adopted the name Consolidated Grocers Corporation in 1945 and Consolidated Foods Corporation in 1954. In 1956, Consolidated Foods purchased a bakery company, Kitchens of Sara Lee (founded 1935), and in 1985 the entire corporation took the name Sara Lee.
Sara Lee is the largest producer of frozen baked goods in the United States. The companyâ€™s Douwe Egberts subsidiaries are major marketers of coffee in Europe, and its Hanes hosiery and underwear are major product lines in the United States. The company also manufactures shoe polish and other personal-care products under the Kiwi label.
After a period of diversification in the 1990s, the company sold off several subsidiaries in the early 2000s to focus on smaller packaged-goods segments, such as foods and beverages, household products, and underwear and intimates. In 2001 Sara Lee launched the Sara Lee Bakery Group, a company that manufactures and distributes fresh-baked goods. Sara Lee has plants operating in more than 40 countries worldwide.
