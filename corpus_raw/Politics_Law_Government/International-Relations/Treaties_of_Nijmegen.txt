Treaties of Nijmegen, Nijmegen also spelled Nimwegen,  peace treaties of 1678–79 that ended the Dutch War, in which France had opposed Spain and the Dutch Republic (now the Netherlands). France gained advantages by arranging terms with each of its enemies separately.
Although negotiations had begun in 1676, the first treaty, between France and the Dutch Republic, was not concluded until Aug. 10, 1678. France agreed to return Maastricht and to suspend Jean-Baptiste Colbert’s anti-Dutch tariff of 1667; these concessions represented a major victory for Dutch naval power and commerce. In the second treaty, concluded between France and Spain on Sept. 17, 1678, Spain was forced to make major concessions, indicating that its power had declined since the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. Spain gave up Franche-Comté, Artois, and 16 fortified towns in Flanders to France. France returned some of its enclaves in the Spanish Netherlands to Spain to round out the formerly arbitrary frontier line there. On the whole, France gained substantially by the possession of a more rational northeastern border and of border fortresses that secured the safety of Paris. Furthermore, with Franche-Comté finally in French hands, Spain had lost its “corridor” between Milan and the Spanish Netherlands.
The Holy Roman emperor Leopold I finally accepted French terms on Feb. 5, 1679, keeping Philippsburg but giving up Freiburg im Breisgau to France and granting free access through his territory to it from Breisach (French since 1648). France also continued to occupy Lorraine, since its duke, Charles V, refused the conditions imposed for his restoration. Two further treaties in 1679 terminated hostilities between France and Brandenburg (Peace of Saint-Germain-en-Laye) and between France and Denmark (Peace of Fontainebleau). Brandenburg and Denmark restored to France’s ally, Sweden, territories taken by them.
