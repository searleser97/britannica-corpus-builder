Latin American Integration Association, Spanish Asociación Latinoamericana de Integración (ALADI),  organization that was established by the Treaty of Montevideo (August 1980) and became operational in March 1981. It seeks economic cooperation among its members. Original members were Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela. Cuba joined in 1999. Several countries and organizations maintain observer status. Headquarters are in Montevideo, Uruguay.
ALADI replaced the Latin American Free Trade Association (LAFTA; Asociación Latinoamericana de Libre Comercio), which had been established in 1960 with the aim of developing a common market in Latin America. The scheme made little progress, and ALADI was created with a more flexible and more limited role of encouraging free trade but with no timetable for the institution of a common market. Members approved a regional tariff preference scheme in 1984 and expanded upon it in 1987 and 1990. In 2001 ALADI signed an agreement with the Andean Community that aimed to facilitate further integration, and Mercosur (a trade organization consisting of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay) also pursued free-trade agreements with ALADI members.
