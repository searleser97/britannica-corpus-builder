Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO),  regional-defense organization from 1955 to 1977, created by the Southeast Asia Collective Defence Treaty, signed at Manila on September 8, 1954, by representatives of Australia, France, New Zealand, Pakistan, the Philippines, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The treaty came into force on February 19, 1955. Pakistan withdrew in 1968, and France suspended financial support in 1975. The organization held its final exercise on February 20, 1976, and formally ended on June 30, 1977.
The formation of SEATO was a response to the demand that the Southeast Asian area be protected against communist expansionism, especially as manifested through military aggression in Korea and Indochina and through subversion backed by organized armed forces in Malaysia and the Philippines. Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos (the successor states of Indochina) were not considered for membership in SEATO for reasons that related to the Geneva agreements of 1954 on Vietnam. These states were, however, accorded military protection by a protocol. Other nations of South and Southeast Asia preferred to retain their foreign policies of nonalignment.
The treaty defined its purposes as defensive only and included provisions for self-help and mutual aid in preventing and countering subversive activities from without and cooperation in promoting economic and social progress. SEATO had no standing forces but relied on the mobile striking power of its member states, which engaged in combined military exercises.
