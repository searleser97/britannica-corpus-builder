Colombo Plan, in full The Colombo Plan for Co-operative Economic and Social Development in Asia and the Pacific, formerly (1951â€“77) Colombo Plan for Cooperative Economic Development in South and South-east Asia,   arrangement for discussing economic development plans and facilitating technical and financial assistance for development projects in south and southeast Asia. It was established at Colombo, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), in 1950 as a result of discussions by the governments of India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Australia, New Zealand, and Great Britain. The United States, Japan, and a number of Southeast Asian, East Asian, and Pacific countries joined later. The plan came into full operation in 1951. Its name was changed following the end of participation by several newly communist countries of Southeast Asia.
Development planning and problems are discussed at an annual meeting. Although there is a continuing body that deals with technical assistance, there is no central fund from which loans or grants are allocated. Instead, financing of development projects is arranged bilaterally between individual governments or with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
