Latin American Economic System (SELA),  Spanish Sistema Económico Latinoamericano,  association formed to promote economic cooperation and development throughout the region of Latin America. Established in 1975 through the Panama Convention, SELA succeeded the Special Committee for Latin American Coordination (CECLA). Nearly 30 Latin American and Caribbean countries are members. SELA’s principal organ, the Latin American Council, meets annually. Headquarters are in Caracas, Venez.
The group’s activities include promoting regional economic strategies, aiding in the development of multinational enterprises, promoting agreements on agricultural and industrial production, and enhancing the sharing of scientific, technological, and cultural resources.
In the 1980s SELA was primarily occupied by international debt reduction. By the 1990s policies were being developed in relation to such international bodies as the World Trade Organization. By the beginning of the 21st century SELA had shifted its objectives toward assisting member states in joining the world economy by encouraging global trade in the region.
