World Communion of Reformed Churches (WCRC), formerly World Alliance of Reformed Churches (Presbyterian and Congregational),  cooperative international organization of Congregational, United, and Presbyterian and Reformed churches. Originally known as the World Alliance of Reformed Churches (Presbyterian and Congregational), the group was formed in Nairobi, Kenya, in 1970 by the merger of the International Congregational Council with the Alliance of the Reformed Churches Throughout the World Holding the Presbyterian System (also called the World Presbyterian Alliance). In 2010 the Alliance united with the Reformed Ecumenical Council, which encompassed some 12 million members in 26 countries, and was renamed the World Communion of Reformed Churches (WCRC). The majority of WCRC member churches are located in developing countries, and the group seeks to promote Christian unity, theology, and social justice.
The International Congregational Council, organized in London in 1891, was an association of Congregational and some Independent and United churches. Its purpose was to foster fellowship and service among its members, but it had no authority over them.
The Alliance of the Reformed Churches Throughout the World Holding the Presbyterian System was organized in London in 1875 by Presbyterian and Reformed churches. It was the oldest international Protestant confessional body in the world. A voluntary organization, the Alliance encouraged fellowship and cooperation among its member churches and promoted their common interests.
