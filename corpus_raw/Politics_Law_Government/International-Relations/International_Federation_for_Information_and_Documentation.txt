International Federation for Information and Documentation, French Fédération Internationale d’Information et de Documentation (FID),  international library organization that was founded in 1895 as the Institut International de Bibliographie (IIB) to promote a unified and centralized approach to bibliographic classification. The IIB was founded by two Belgian lawyers, Paul Otlet and Henri Lafontaine. In 1905 the IIB published the Universal Decimal Classification, a classificatory system for publications that was an expanded version of the Dewey Decimal Classification. The IIB was renamed the Fédération Internationale de Documentation in 1938. The FID’s current aims are to promote, through international cooperation, research in and development of information science and documentation management in the physical sciences, social sciences, and humanities. It is concerned with problems in the organization, storage, retrieval, dissemination, and evaluation of information by both mechanical and electronic means. The FID has consulting status with many international organizations. In the late 20th century it had national members in more than 65 countries and more than 300 affiliated organizations and individuals. Its headquarters are in The Hague, Neth.
