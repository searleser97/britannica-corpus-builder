United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA),  subsidiary agency created by the United Nations (UN) General Assembly in 1949 to provide relief, health, and education services for Palestinians who lost both their homes and means of livelihood during the Arab-Israeli wars following the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948. Beginning operations in 1950, UNRWA was originally headquartered in Beirut, Lebanon, but was moved to Vienna, Austria, in 1978. In 1996 the General Assembly moved the agency to the Gaza Strip to demonstrate the Assembly’s commitment to the Arab-Israeli peace process. UNRWA’s member states include Belgium, Egypt, France, Japan, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, and several Arab states of the Persian Gulf region; the Palestinian Authority (PA) has observer status.
Approximately 500,000 Palestinians originally qualified for relief, but by 2015 there were more than five million registered Palestinian refugees, including the children of the original refugees. As the largest UN operation in the Middle East and one of the biggest employers in the region—with service operations in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip—UNRWA provides camps, food, clothing, schools, vocational training, and health clinics, often working in cooperation with the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
UNRWA is financed by voluntary contributions of member governments. Like its predecessor organization, the UN Relief for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, it was originally designed as a temporary agency, though its mandate has been continuously renewed every three years by the General Assembly. Its chief officer, the commissioner-general—the only leader of a UN agency to report directly to the General Assembly—is appointed by the UN secretary-general with the approval of an Advisory Commission.
