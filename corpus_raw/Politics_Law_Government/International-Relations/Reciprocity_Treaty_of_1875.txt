Reciprocity Treaty of 1875,  free-trade agreement between the United States and the Hawaiian kingdom that guaranteed a duty-free market for Hawaiian sugar in exchange for special economic privileges for the United States that were denied to other countries. The treaty helped establish the groundwork for the Hawaiian islands’ eventual annexation.
Throughout the early and mid-19th century, the sovereignty of the Hawaiian islands was threatened by the imperial advances of Great Britain, France, and the United States. Of particular interest to those powers was Hawaii’s burgeoning sugar industry. As a result of the American Civil War, sugar prices rose dramatically in the United States (much of the sugar production in the United States had occurred in the southern states that seceded from the Union, particularly Louisiana), a situation that helped galvanize efforts by members of the U.S. government and the Hawaiian planter class to establish a treaty of reciprocity between the United States and Hawaii. After several failed treaty attempts, the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875 was signed; it entered into force on Sept. 9, 1876. When the treaty was renewed in 1887, the United States received exclusive rights to enter and establish a naval base at Pearl Harbor.
