Confederation of the Rhine, French Confédération du Rhin German Rheinbund,  union (1806–13) of all the states of Germany, except Austria and Prussia, under the aegis of Napoleon I, which enabled the French to unify and dominate the country until Napoleon’s downfall. The formation of the confederation was preceded by French encroachment in Germany beginning in 1792: all territory west of the Rhine River was annexed outright, and the first steps toward consolidation were taken by compensating the larger German states (in particular, Prussia, Bavaria, Württemberg, Baden, Hanover, and Oldenburg) for losses there by awarding them territories of secondary German states. In 1803 the number of states was drastically reduced, and in July 1806 Napoleon united the expanded kingdoms of Bavaria and Württemberg and the enlarged states of Baden, Hesse-Darmstadt, Nassau, and Berg, as well as some smaller states, as the Confederation of the Rhine. Saxony joined the confederation in 1807 as a kingdom. In the Treaties of Tilsit (1807), Prussia ceded territory west of the Elbe River to the confederation. The Confederation of the Rhine was abolished after Napoleon’s fall from power in 1813. Napoleon was chiefly interested in the confederation as a counterweight to the two principal German states, Austria and Prussia, but the consolidation that it brought broke down old barriers and later contributed to the movement for German unification.
