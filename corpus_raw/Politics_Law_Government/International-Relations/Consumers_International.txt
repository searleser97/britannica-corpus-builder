Consumers International (CI),  formerly (1960–95) International Organisation of Consumers Unions (IOCU),  international consortium of consumer-advocacy groups that promotes the rights and interests of consumers. CI was founded as the International Organisation of Consumers Unions (IOCU) in 1960 and by the early 21st century had grown to include more than 200 member organizations in more than 100 countries. It is headquartered in London and has offices in Kuala Lumpur, Malay., and in Santiago.
CI defends what it considers to be eight basic consumer rights: the right to protection from unsafe products, the right to product information, the right to a range of product choices, the right to representation in government policy, the right to products that satisfy basic needs, the right to redress for grievances concerning unsatisfactory products, the right to consumer education, and the right to an environment that is not threatening to human well-being. CI acts through its member organizations to influence local and international policies that affect consumers, and it campaigns to promote corporate accountability and to protect consumers from deceptive marketing practices. To raise consumer awareness, the group also publishes research on product-safety issues and abuses in the marketplace.
CI is represented on a number of influential global-policy organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO), the Codex Alimentarius Commission, UNICEF (United Nations Children’s Fund), and the World Trade Organization (WTO). It is also involved in various issue-based campaigns with organizations such as the Baby Food Action Network, the Pesticide Action Network, and Health Action International.
CI is funded by membership fees and grants from governments, multilateral agencies, and nongovernmental organizations. It is governed by a general assembly that elects a president and a 13-member council to renewable four-year terms.
