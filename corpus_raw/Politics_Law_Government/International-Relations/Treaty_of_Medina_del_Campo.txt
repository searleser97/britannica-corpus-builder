Treaty of Medina del Campo,  (1489), treaty between Spain and England, which, although never fully accepted by either side, established the dominating themes in Anglo-Spanish relations in the late 15th and early 16th centuries. It was signed at Medina del Campo, in northern Spain, on March 27 and ratified by Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile the following day. It settled the details of a proposed marriage between the infanta Catherine, the youngest daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella, and Arthur (d. 1502), the eldest son of the English king Henry VII. It also effected a mutual reduction of tariffs between the two countries and attempted to arrive at a common policy in opposition to France. The terms of the anti-French alliance were unacceptable to Henry VII, who ratified it (Sept. 23, 1490) with amendments that were in turn rejected by Spain. The marriage was renegotiated in 1496 on terms similar to those proposed in 1489.
