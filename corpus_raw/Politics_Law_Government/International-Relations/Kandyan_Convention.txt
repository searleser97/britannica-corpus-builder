Kandyan Convention,  agreement in 1815 between the United Kingdom and the chiefs of the kingdom of Kandy in Ceylon (Sri Lanka). Under the terms of the convention, Kandy was annexed to the other British holdings in Ceylon, giving Britain complete control over the island. In addition, the South Indian king of Kandy was deposed and his sovereignty vested in the British crown.
It was the Kandyan chiefs themselves who, in opposition to their then oppressive South Indian king, had invited British intervention. The convention therefore upheld many of their traditional rights and powers. In addition, the convention specified that the traditional laws, customs, and institutions of the Kandyans were to be maintained and administered by the usual native authorities. The Kandyans came to regret this 1815 agreement and, in 1817, rebelled. By 1818 the rebellion was put down, and an ensuing British proclamation took away from the Kandyans most of the rights that had been guaranteed them by the convention.
