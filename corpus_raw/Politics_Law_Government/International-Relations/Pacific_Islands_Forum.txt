Pacific Islands Forum, formerly (1971â€“2000) South Pacific Forum,  organization established in 1971 to provide a setting for heads of government to discuss common issues and problems facing the independent and self-governing states of the South Pacific. Headquartered in Suva, Fiji, the Forum includes Australia, the Cook Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, and Western Samoa.
At its first meeting, senior officials of the Forum recommended that a permanent bureau be established to deal with economic matters, a measure approved the following year. The resulting group, the South Pacific Bureau for Economic Co-operation, was established in April 1973 and worked to facilitate member cooperation on trade, tourism, transportation, and economic development. In 2000 Forum leaders adopted the Biketawa Declaration, which was a response to regional political instability and which put forward a set of principles and actions for members to take to promote open, democratic, and clean government, as well as equal rights for citizens regardless of gender, race, colour, creed, or political belief.
The Forum holds an annual meeting of heads of government. After the annual meeting, a ministerial-level dialogue meeting is held with selected non-regional parties, including Canada, China, the European Union, France, Great Britain, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, and the United States.
