Stresa Front,  coalition of France, Britain, and Italy formed in April 1935 at Stresa, Italy, to oppose Adolf Hitlerâ€™s announced intention to rearm Germany, which violated terms of the Treaty of Versailles. When Italy invaded Ethiopia later that year, France and Britain tried to reconcile the action with the need to remain united against Germany, but the coalition soon dissolved.
