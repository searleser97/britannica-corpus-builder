Group of 77 (G-77),  loose alliance of developing countries established on June 15, 1964. The name of the group derives from the 77 original signatories to the Joint Declaration of the Seventy-Seven Countries at the conclusion of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in Geneva. The primary goals of the G-77 are to maintain the independence and sovereignty of all developing countries, to defend the economic interests of member countries by insisting on equal standing with developed countries in the global marketplace, to establish a united front on issues of common concern, and to strengthen ties between member countries. Because of the historical significance of the meeting, the name G-77 has been kept despite the groupâ€™s growth to include more than 130 countries.
The basic principles of the G-77 were outlined in the Charter of Algiers, which was adopted in 1967. The G-77 subsequently developed an institutional structure consisting of five chapters based in Geneva, Nairobi, Paris, Rome, and Vienna and an Intergovernmental Group of 24 based in Washington, D.C. Each chapter has a chairperson appointed on a one-year rotating basis from one of its member countries. The South Summit, the highest decision-making entity of the G-77, convenes every five years. In addition, the Annual Meeting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the G-77 occurs at the beginning of every regular session of the United Nations General Assembly.
