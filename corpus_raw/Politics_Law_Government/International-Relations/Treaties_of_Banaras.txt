Treaties of Banaras,  (1773 and 1775), two agreements regulating relations between the British government of Bengal and the ruler of the Muslim state of Oudh (Ayodhya). The defense of Oudh had been guaranteed in 1765 on the condition that the state’s ruler, Shujāʿ al-Dawlah, pay the cost of the necessary troops. The First Treaty of Banaras (1773) was the result of the Mughal emperor Shah ʿĀlam’s cession of Allahabad and Kora to the warlike Marathas as the price of their support. Warren Hastings, the British governor, ceded Allahabad and Kora to Shujāʿ and promised to support him against the menacing Afghan Rohillas in return for cash payments. This move, designed to strengthen Oudh as a buffer state between Bengal and the Marathas, led to the Rohilla War of 1774, which later became a major factor in Hastings’s impeachment (1788–95).
The Second Treaty of Banaras (1775) is otherwise known as the Treaty of Faizabad. It was forced on the new vizier of Oudh by the company’s governing council after the death of Shujāʿ. The vizier had to pay a larger subsidy for the use of British troops and cede Banaras (now Varanasi) to the East India Company. This treaty led to a revolt by the raja Chaith Singh of Banaras in 1781.
