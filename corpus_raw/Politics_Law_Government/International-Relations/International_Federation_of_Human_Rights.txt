International Federation of Human Rights, French Fédération Internationale des Droits de l’Homme (FIDH),  international nongovernmental organization of human rights groups focused on promoting adherence to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948). Established in 1922 with 10 members, the organization grew to include more than 150 human rights groups operating independently of religious or governmental influence. FIDH is headquartered in Paris.
FIDH has worked on a variety of campaigns, ranging from fighting impunity to promoting respect for human rights in the context of counterterrorism. FIDH works by documenting actions that violate basic human rights and by publicizing such abuses through reports and press releases. FIDH also conducts research and provides advocacy and litigation services.
FIDH’s international board, which is headed by a president, meets three times a year to discuss political strategies and establish a budget. All members of the group are volunteers.
