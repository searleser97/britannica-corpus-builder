World Union for Progressive Judaism,  in Judaism, an international federation of Reform congregations that seeks to coordinate old and newly established Reform groups in various parts of the world. Since its founding in London in 1926 it has grown considerably and now maintains headquarters in New York City. Its main support comes from private donations in the United States. In 1955 it set up an international centre in Paris for the training of rabbis, and every other year it holds an international conference on a predetermined topic. The United Nations has granted the World Union consultative status as a nongovernmental organization (NGO).
