New England Confederation, also called United Colonies of New England,  in British American colonial history, a federation of Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Haven, and Plymouth established in May 1643 by delegates from those four Puritan colonies. Several factors influenced the formation of this alliance, including the solution of trade, boundary, and religious disputes, but the principal impetus was a concern over defense against attacks by the French, the Dutch, or the Indians. Because of their divergence from accepted Puritan precepts, settlements in what later became Rhode Island and Maine were refused admission to the confederation.
According to its articles of agreement, the New England Confederation was to be “a firme and perpetual league of friendship and amytie,” and its government was to be composed of a directorate of eight commissioners, two from each colony. The commissioners were expected to meet annually or more often, if necessary. The articles authorized the commissioners to fix quotas for men and expenses during wartime, to arbitrate disputes with foreign powers or other colonies, to ensure extradition of escaped servants, prisoners, and other fugitives, and to regulate Indian affairs. Six affirmative votes were required to approve the decisions of the confederation; failing that, the pending issue would be referred to the legislatures of the member colonies.
The New England Confederation did achieve some of its goals, but the alliance ultimately proved to be weak, since its decisions were only advisory and were often ignored by Massachusetts, its strongest member. The confederation’s influence declined with the merger of Connecticut and New Haven (1662–65), though it continued to exist until the Massachusetts charter was forfeited in 1684. The New England Confederation had represented the first significant effort by English colonists to form an intercolonial alliance for mutual benefit.
