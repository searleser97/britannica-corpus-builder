Progressive Party,   (1948), in the United States, a dissident political faction founded in 1947 by Henry A. Wallace, who had broken with the Democratic administration of President Harry S. Truman. Unlike the Progressive organizations of 1912 and 1924, Wallaceâ€™s party campaigned on changes in foreign policy rather than domestic issues. It particularly advocated a more conciliatory policy toward the Soviet Union. The party won more than 1,000,000 popular votes in the 1948 election but was never again influential.
