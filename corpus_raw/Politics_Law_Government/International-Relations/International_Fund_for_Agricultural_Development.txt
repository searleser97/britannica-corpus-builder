International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD),  United Nations (UN) specialized agency that supports increased food production in poor communities. Partly in response to severe famines in the southern Sahara in the early 1970s, the 1974 World Food Conference adopted a resolution that established IFAD in November 1977. The organization is headquartered in Rome, Italy.
IFADâ€™s mandate is to provide funding and other resources for programs that help poor farmers and pastoralists as well as landless and indigenous peoples in rural areas. Its Governing Council, consisting of representatives of more than 160 member states, is the principal decision-making body, and its 18-member Executive Board oversees daily operations. Over the last decades of the 20th century, IFAD funded more than 500 projects in more than 100 countries.
