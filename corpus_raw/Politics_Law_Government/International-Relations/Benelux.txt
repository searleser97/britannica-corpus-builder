Benelux, in full Benelux Economic Union, French Union Ã‰conomique Benelux, or Dutch Benelux Economische Unie,  economic union of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, with the objective of bringing about total economic integration by ensuring free circulation of persons, goods, capital, and services; by following a coordinated policy in the economic, financial, and social fields; and by pursuing a common policy with regard to foreign trade.
Belgium and Luxembourg had bilaterally formed an economic union in 1921; plans for a customs union of the three countries were made in the London Customs Convention in September 1944 and became operative in 1948. By 1956 nearly all of the internal trade of the union was tariff-free. On February 3, 1958, the Treaty of the Benelux Economic Union was signed; it became operative in 1960. Benelux became the first completely free international labour market; the movement of capital and services was also made free. Postal and transport rates were standardized, and welfare policies were coordinated. In 1970 border controls were abolished.
The day-to-day operations of Benelux are conducted by the Secretariat-General; the executive authority of the organization rests with the Committee of Ministers, which meets quarterly.
Benelux was once regarded as a promising experiment by which neighbouring countries would form customs unions that might then merge into wider economic unions. Following the ratification of the treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community in 1952, however, interest in such developments shifted to plans for the European Economic Community (EEC; later succeeded by the European Union), of which Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg are original members. For practical issues of economic integration, Benelux served as a useful example for the EEC.
