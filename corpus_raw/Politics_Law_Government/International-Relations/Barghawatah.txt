Barghawāṭah,  Amazigh (Berber) tribal confederation that created a religio-political state in Morocco (8th–12th century). The Barghawāṭah, members of the Maṣmūdah family inhabiting the plain between the Middle Atlas (Moyen Atlas) mountain range and the Atlantic, had joined the Miknāsah and Ghumārah Amazigh in the Khārijite revolt against the Umayyad caliph in 740–742, seizing Tangier and defeating Umayyad armies from Spain in the Battle of the Nobles (740). Shortly afterward the rebellion was suppressed, but a new leader, Ṣāliḥ ibn Ṭarīf, emerged in 748–749 among the Barghawāṭah and presented himself as a prophet, teaching a mixture of Islamic, pagan, and astrological beliefs. His successors propagated this doctrine throughout the confederation. In the reign of Abū Ghufayl (885–913) the confederation became firmly established in Barghawāṭah territory and aided in the creation of a highly defensive state that also proved to be commercially prosperous.
By the mid-10th century the Barghawāṭah were influential enough to maintain diplomatic relations with the Umayyads of Córdoba, despite the nonconforming beliefs of the Amazigh and the rigid Sunnism of the Muslim court. Relations between the two powers were strained by the century’s end, however, and the Barghawāṭah were beset by two invasions from Spain (977–978; 998–999) and an attack by an agent of the Fāṭimid dynasty from the east (982–983). The Barghawāṭah successfully met these incursions, but in the 11th century they were conquered by their Amazigh neighbours, the Banū Īfran, allies of the Umayyads. The Almoravid invasion followed in 1059, and, though the Barghawāṭah killed the Almoravid spiritual leader ʿAbd Allāh ibn Yāsīn in battle, they themselves were soundly defeated. The remaining Barghawāṭah did not survive the Almohad assault and disappeared after their defeat in 1148–49.
