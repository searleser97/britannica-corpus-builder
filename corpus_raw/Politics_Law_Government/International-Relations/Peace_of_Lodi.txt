Peace of Lodi,  (April 9, 1454), treaty between Venice and Milan ending the war of succession to the Milanese duchy in favour of Francesco Sforza. It marked the beginning of a 40-year period of relative peace, during which power was balanced among the five states that dominated the Italian peninsula—Venice, Milan, Naples, Florence, and the Papal States.
Venice, faced with a threat to its commercial empire by the Ottoman Turks, was eager for peace in Italy. Sforza, a condottiere (mercenary general) who had been proclaimed duke by the people of Milan, also was eager to end the costly war. By the terms of the peace, Sforza was recognized as ruler of Milan, and Venice regained its considerable holdings in northern Italy, including Brescia and Bergamo. The other belligerents (Milan’s allies—Florence, Mantua, and Genoa—and Venice’s allies—Naples, Savoy, and Montferrat) had no choice but to acquiesce to the peace.
In conjunction with the treaty, a 25-year mutual defensive pact was concluded to maintain existing boundaries, and an Italian League (Lega Italica) was set up. The states of the league promised to defend one another in the event of attack and to support a contingent of soldiers to provide military aid. The league, officially proclaimed by Pope Nicholas V on March 2, 1455, was soon accepted by almost all the Italian states. Although the league was often renewed during the 15th century, the system was not entirely effective in preventing war, and individual states continued to pursue their own interests against others. The league definitely lapsed after the French invasion of the peninsula in 1494.
