Geneva Protocol, official name Protocol for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes,  (1924) League of Nations draft treaty to ensure collective security in Europe. Submitted by Edvard Bene≈°, the protocol proposed sanctions against an aggressor nation and provided a mechanism for the peaceful settlement of disputes. States would agree to submit all disputes to the Permanent Court of International Justice, and any state refusing arbitration was to be deemed the aggressor. The French enthusiastically supported the protocol, but it failed after it was rejected by the British.
