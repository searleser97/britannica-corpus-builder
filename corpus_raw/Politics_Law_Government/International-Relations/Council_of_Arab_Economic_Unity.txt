Council of Arab Economic Unity, Arabic al-Jamʿiyyah al-ʿArabiyyah Lil-wiḥdah al-Iqtisādiyyah,  Arab economic organization established in June 1957 by a resolution of the Arab Economic Council of the Arab League. Its first meeting was held in 1964. Members include Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Mauritania, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), Somalia, Sudan, Syria, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen.
The organization is devoted to achieving economic integration within a framework of economic and social development and to promoting freedom of movement for labour, capital, and services. In 1964 it approved a decision to create an Arab Common Market—which Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Libya, Mauritania, Syria, and Yemen announced an intention to join—to promote Arab integration by reducing tariffs. Although initial efforts to establish the market were unsuccessful, new proposals were put forward in the 1980s and ’90s.
The organization’s chief policy-making organ is the Council, which is composed of economic and trade and industry ministers. The Council meets twice each year to develop policies leading to a customs union. A permanent secretariat headquartered in Cairo, Egypt, is charged with implementing the Council’s decisions, conducting research, and compiling statistics.
