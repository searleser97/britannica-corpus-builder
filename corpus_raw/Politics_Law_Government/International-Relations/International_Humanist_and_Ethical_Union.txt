International Humanist and Ethical Union (IHEU),  global union of humanist and related organizations, founded in Amsterdam in 1952. In its first 50 years the IHEU grew to include more than 100 member organizations. Headquarters are in London.
The IHEU promotes humanism as an ethical philosophy, emphasizing reason, freedom of thought, and human-centred values. According to the IHEU, humanism entails respect for democracy and human rights, secularism, the obligation to make society more just and humane, and the rejection of all supernatural explanations of reality. (See also humanism.)
The IHEU sponsors international humanist conferences, including the triennial World Humanist Conference, and develops campaigns in cooperation with its member organizations. It also works with major international bodies such as UNICEF (the United Nations Children’s Fund) and UNESCO (the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization). The IHEU has consultative status with the United Nations (UN), UNICEF, and the Council of Europe and observer status with the African Commission on Human and People’s Rights. Member organizations have included the Bertrand Russell Society, the European Humanist Federation, and the International Academy of Humanism.
The IHEU is governed by an executive committee consisting of a president, a treasurer, and four vice presidents. The executive committee is elected by a general assembly representing member organizations. The IHEU is funded primarily through donations and membership fees.
