Treaty of Campo Formio,  (Oct. 17, 1797), a peace settlement between France and Austria, signed at Campo Formio (now Campoformido, Italy), a village in Venezia Giulia southwest of Udine, following the defeat of Austria in Napoleon Bonaparte’s first Italian campaign.
The treaty preserved most of the French conquests and marked the completion of Napoleon’s victory over the First Coalition. The Cisalpine and Ligurian republics in northern Italy were established under French influence, and France gained Venice’s Ionian Islands in the Adriatic Sea. In compensation for loss of possessions in Lombardy, Napoleon gave Austria the Venetian territory east of the Adige River, including Istria, Dalmatia, and the city of Venice. This act marked the end of 1,100 years of Venetian independence. Austria gave up its Belgian provinces to France and also agreed, pending ratification at a congress of the estates of the empire, that France could annex the territory it occupied on the left bank of the Rhine River from Basel to Andernach, including Mainz. In return, France promised to use its influence to help Austria obtain Salzburg and part of Bavaria. It was secretly agreed that Prussia, a former ally of Austria, was to receive no territorial compensation. Of the original anti-French coalition, only Britain remained hostile to France after the conclusion of this treaty; Prussia had made peace in March 1795 after the effectuation of the Third Partition of Poland in January 1795.
