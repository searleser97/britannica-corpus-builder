Montreux Convention,  (1936) agreement concerning the Dardanelles strait. In response to Turkeyâ€™s request to refortify the area, the signers of the Treaty of Lausanne and others met in Montreux, Switz., and agreed to return the zone to Turkish military control. The convention allowed Turkey to close the straits to all warships when it was at war and to permit merchant ships free passage. See also Straits Question.
