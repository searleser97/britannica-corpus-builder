Treaty of Waitangi,  (Feb. 6, 1840), historic pact between Great Britain and a number of New Zealand Maori tribes of North Island. It purported to protect Maori rights and was the immediate basis of the British annexation of New Zealand. Negotiated at the settlement of Waitangi on February 5–6 by Britain’s designated consul and lieutenant governor William Hobson and many leading Maori chiefs, the treaty’s three articles provided for (1) the Maori signatories’ acceptance of the British queen’s sovereignty in their lands, (2) the crown’s protection of Maori possessions, with the exclusive right of the queen to purchase Maori land, and (3) full rights of British subjects for the Maori signatories.
In May 1840 Britain annexed all of New Zealand, the North Island on the basis of the Waitangi treaty and the South Island by the (dubious in this case) right of discovery. The vital land-selling article of the treaty, designed to protect the Maori from large-scale private land purchase that would have cheated them and disrupted their society, remained in effect until 1862.
The arrangement had serious shortcomings in practice. The Maori were dissatisfied because the impoverished colonial government could not afford to buy much land, and the land it did buy was resold to Europeans at a substantial profit. British immigrants were also angered by government land profits and by the scarcity of land. The resulting interracial and intercultural tension led to warfare in 1844–47 and the New Zealand Wars of the 1860s. The land-selling article of the treaty ceased to be operative with the passage of the Native Land Act of 1862, which provided for private purchase of Maori land.
Since 1960, February 6 has been celebrated by New Zealanders as Waitangi Day, an occasion for thanksgiving.
