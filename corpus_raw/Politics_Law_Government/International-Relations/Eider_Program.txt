Eider Program,   (1848–64), the domestic and foreign policy cornerstone of Denmark’s National Liberal governments during the Schleswig-Holstein crises. The program, which called for the incorporation of the duchy of Schleswig into Denmark, was brought to an end by the German occupation of both duchies in 1864.
Along with Holstein, Schleswig—separated from its sister duchy by the Eider River—had long been affiliated with Denmark through personal, rather than national, union under the Danish kings. The National Liberal government sought to have Schleswig made part of Denmark by the provisions of the constitution of 1849 and fought for this end in the Schleswig War (1848–50) against rebels in Schleswig-Holstein, who were helped by Prussian armed intervention. When the war came to an end in 1850 with an international agreement to maintain the affiliation of the two duchies with the Danish crown, but to maintain as well the constitutional separation of Schleswig from Denmark, the National Liberals were turned out of office and the Eider Program was set aside. International tensions engendered by the status of the duchies continued, however, and the National Liberals returned to power in 1857. In 1863, with Prussia preoccupied with the Polish rebellion, the Danes thought the time right to incorporate Schleswig into Denmark. But Prussia invaded the duchies, and in the Danish-German war of 1864 Denmark lost Schleswig. See also Schleswig-Holstein.
