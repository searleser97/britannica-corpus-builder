League of Corinth,  offensive and defensive alliance of all the Greek states except Sparta, organized in 337 bce at Corinth under the leadership of Philip II of Macedon.
A “council of the Greeks,” to which each state elected delegates proportionate to its military and naval strength, decided all matters of federal government, including foreign policy. At its first meeting, the league decided to conduct a war against Persia and elected Philip commander of its armed forces. When he was murdered the following year (336), his son, Alexander the Great, succeeded him as head of the league. The Greek contribution of soldiers to Alexander’s Asian campaign was neither significant nor dependable, and the league’s major action seems to have been the condemnation of the Thebans to slavery and the distribution of their territory among neighbouring states following their revolts (336 and 335 bce). The league broke up after Alexander’s death (323) but was briefly restored by Demetrius I (302).
