Virginius affair,   (1873), seizure of the Cuban ship Virginius (fraudulently flying the U.S. flag and carrying U.S. registration) by Spanish authorities and the summary execution of 53 of its passengers and crew, among them U.S. and British citizens. Hostilities between the United States and Spain were averted when Spain returned the ship and paid an indemnity of $80,000 to the families of the executed Americans. Spain also paid an indemnity to Great Britain for the executed British subjects. A promise to punish the Spanish officers responsible for the incident was never fulfilled.
