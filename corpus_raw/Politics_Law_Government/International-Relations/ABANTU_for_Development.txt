ABANTU for Development,  a pan-African international nongovernmental organization that trains women for leadership in sustainable development. Abantu means “people” in several African languages. ABANTU was established in 1991 in London by African women. Its vision statement focuses on recognizing gender discrimination as the key obstacle to sustainable development and social justice. ABANTU’s main offices are located in the United Kingdom, Kenya, and Tanzania, with regional offices in Ghana and Nigeria.
ABANTU desires to empower African people, especially women, to participate in policy and decision making at local, national, regional, and international levels to make an impact on their lives socially and economically. ABANTU focuses on four key areas: gender and poverty, gender and conflict, gender and governance, and gender and information and communication technologies. Its main goal is to advance women’s interests in a way that is equally beneficial to men and women.
The organization has equipped over 500 African women “trainers” through its workshops throughout Africa and the U.K. Through using adult learning techniques and recognizing learning differences between genders, ABANTU trainers strive to both educate and solicit participant contributions. These women are skilled in gender and policy analysis and host workshops in their respective countries to address 
topics such as gender stereotypes, social change concepts, climate change adaptation strategies, and nondiscriminatory policy development for the protection and support of HIV-infected workers.
ABANTU also provides an assortment of reports and activities derived from its research and publishes a quarterly newsletter, ABANTU News. Additionally, the organization arranges seminars, public policy forums, and consultations with policy makers and other women’s groups to provide content for advocacy campaigns.
