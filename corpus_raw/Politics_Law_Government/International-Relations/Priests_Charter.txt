Priests’ Charter, German Pfaffenbrief,   (October 1370), treaty that unified the legal system in all the Swiss cantons, particularly highlighting two features: safety on the highways for traders and nonintervention by foreign priests. Bruno Brun, a provost wanting to escape punishment, was the catalyst for an amendment in the Zürich constitution, which ruled against the foreign clergy exercising jurisdiction while in Switzerland. The Priests’ Charter contained the first mention of “Confederation” (Eidgenossenschaft) and provided for a voting system based on majority rather than unanimity.
