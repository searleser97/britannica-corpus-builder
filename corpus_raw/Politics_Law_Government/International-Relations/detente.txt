Détente,  period of the easing of Cold War tensions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union from 1967 to 1979. The era was a time of increased trade and cooperation with the Soviet Union and the signing of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) treaties. Relations cooled again with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
U.S. Pres. Richard M. Nixon, who came into office at the beginning of 1969, believed that his track record as a staunch anti-communist and tough negotiator would win conservative support for his efforts at détente. In his inaugural address Nixon proclaimed, “We are entering an era of negotiation,” and he went on to say:
By improving U.S. relations with China and becoming the first U.S. president to visit that country since it came under communist rule, Nixon compelled the Soviet Union to be more open to political overtures from the United States. In May 1972, some three months after his visit to China, Nixon traveled to Moscow, where he met with Premier Aleksey N. Kosygin and Communist Party leader Leonid Brezhnev. They discussed matters such as arms limitation, prevention of nuclear war, and increased trade between the United States and the Soviet Union. The most important immediate outcome of that summit meeting was the signing, on May 26, of SALT I.
