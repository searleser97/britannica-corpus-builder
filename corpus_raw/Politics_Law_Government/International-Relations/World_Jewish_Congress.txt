World Jewish Congress (WJC),  international organization of Jewish communities, Jewish organizations, and individuals founded in Geneva in 1936. The WJC works to strengthen the bonds between Jews and to protect their rights and safety. It also works with governments and other authorities on matters concerning the Jewish people. By the early 21st century the WJC had grown to include member organizations in more than 80 countries. Headquarters are in New York City, with affiliate offices around the world.
The WJC was created to counter the rising tide of Nazism in Europe. It became the first organization to warn the world of the Nazis’ “final solution” when it sent a telegram to the Allied Powers in August 1942. The organization has been active in the quest for Holocaust reparations since the 1950s. In the 1990s the group also cofounded the World Jewish Restitution Organization, which is dedicated to restoring Jewish property that was seized during World War II. The WJC is a strong political supporter of Israel.
The organization is led by a president and other members of an executive committee, which is elected by a plenary assembly that meets every four years. A governing board meets annually between meetings of the plenary assembly. The WJC maintains consultative status and relations with various United Nations subsidiary organs and agencies.
