Trent Affair,   (1861), incident during the American Civil War involving the doctrine of freedom of the seas, which nearly precipitated war between Great Britain and the United States. On Nov. 8, 1861, Captain Charles Wilkes, commanding the Union frigate San Jacinto, seized from the neutral British ship Trent two Confederate commissioners, James Murray Mason and John Slidell, who were seeking the support of England and France for the cause of the Confederacy.
Despite initial rejoicing by the Northern populace and Congress, this unauthorized seizure aroused a storm of indignant protest and demands for war throughout Britain. The British government sent an ultimatum demanding an American apology and the release of Mason and Slidell. To avert armed conflict, Secretary of State William Seward, on December 26, replied that Wilkes had erred in failing to bring the Trent into port for adjudication, thus violating Americaâ€™s policy of freedom of the seas. The Confederate commissioners were released shortly thereafter.
