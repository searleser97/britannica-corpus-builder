International Rescue Committee (IRC),  international humanitarian aid organization based in the United States and Europe. Organized in 1933 at the request of Albert Einstein to assist German victims and enemies of Nazism, the IRC has since supported a wide variety of groups that are persecuted or displaced because of ethnic conflicts, war, or environmental crises. The IRC has headquarters in New York City, Washington, D.C., London, Brussels, and Geneva and branch offices in several countries throughout the world.
The IRC provides emergency services, health care, sanitation systems, children’s services, and educational infrastructure. It also works to maintain and improve local governments and civil society. The organization offers resettlement and educational services for refugees seeking asylum in the United States. Historically, the IRC helped provide badly needed assistance to victims of many of the world’s greatest catastrophes and conflicts. Relief projects included feeding the people of West Berlin during the Soviet blockade of the city in the 1940s, assisting refugees in the wake of the genocide and civil war in Rwanda in the 1990s, and aiding refugees displaced by the Iraq War in the early 21st century. Because the IRC commands substantial resources and is internationally recognized, it is often one of the first organizations to provide support in a crisis situation.
