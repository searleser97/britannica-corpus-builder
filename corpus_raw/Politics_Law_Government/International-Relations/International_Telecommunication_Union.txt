International Telecommunication Union (ITU),  specialized agency of the United Nations that was created to encourage international cooperation in all forms of telecommunication. Its activities include maintaining order in the allocation of radio frequencies, setting standards on technical and operational matters, and assisting countries in developing their own telecommunication systems.
The origin of the ITU can be traced to 1865, when the International Telegraph Union was established by a convention signed in Paris. The International Telecommunication Convention of 1932, which merged the International Telegraph Convention and the International Radiotelegraph Convention, provided that the International Telecommunication Union would succeed the International Telegraph Union when the convention became effective in 1934. It was made a specialized agency of the United Nations in 1947, and the convention has been revised several times.
The organization of the ITU includes: (1) the Plenipotentiary Conference, which is the supreme organ of the ITU and meets every four years; (2) World Administrative Conferences, which meet according to technical needs; (3) the ITU Council, which meets annually and is responsible for executing decisions of the Plenipotentiary Conference; (4) the General Secretariat, responsible for administrative and financial services; (5) the Radiocommunications Sector, which was formed by the merger of those activities of the former International Consultative Radio Committee and the former International Frequency Registration Board that were concerned with the assignment of radio frequencies; (6) the Telecommunication Standardization Sector, which was formed by the merger of the former International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee with the standards-setting activities of the International Consultative Radio Committee and conducts technical studies and sets international standards for telecommunications; and (7) the Telecommunication Development Sector, which facilitates the growth of telecommunications in developing nations.
The ITU has had its headquarters in Geneva since 1948, when it was moved from Bern.
