Linggadjati Agreement, also called Cheribon Agreement,  treaty between the Dutch and the Republic of Indonesia drafted on Nov. 15, 1946, at Linggadjati (now Linggajati) near Cheribon (now Cirebon, formerly Tjirebon, western Java). Soon after the capitulation of the Japanese in World War II, the independence of the Republic of Indonesia was declared, on Aug. 17, 1945, by the Indonesian nationalists. The Dutch attempted to restore their rule in Indonesia and hence came into conflict with the republican government, whose influence was still confined to Java and Sumatra. Upon the departure of the Allied troops, the Dutch and the republic began negotiations, which led to the Linggadjati Agreement that was signed in Batavia (now Jakarta) on March 25, 1947.
The main content of the agreement was that the Netherlands recognized the republic as the de facto authority in Java (including Madura) and Sumatra. Both governments were to cooperate in the formation of a sovereign, democratic, and federal United States of Indonesia, comprising the entire territories of the Dutch East Indies, including the Republic of Indonesia, Kalimantan (Borneo), and the Great East. Both governments were to cooperate in establishing a Netherlands–Indonesian Union with the Dutch queen as its head. Both the United States of Indonesia and the Netherlands–Indonesian Union were to be formed not later than Jan. 1, 1949. The two governments agreed to settle by arbitration any dispute that might arise and that they could not settle by themselves. The agreement was intended to lay down broad principles, leaving the details to be worked out later. Each party interpreted the agreement to suit its interests, however, and eventually open conflict developed between the Dutch and Indonesian governments.
