Fürstenbund, German League of Princes,  league founded on July 23, 1785, under the leadership of King Frederick II the Great of Prussia to preserve the status quo among the several German states and curb the ambitions in Germany of the Holy Roman emperor Joseph II. It represented the final phase of the conflict between Frederick and the Austrian Habsburgs. Earlier, Frederick had thwarted Joseph’s plan to annex Bavaria (in the War of the Bavarian Succession, 1778–79), but in the early 1780s, Joseph renewed his attempts. Frederick was able to persuade other princes—of Saxony, Hanover, and later Saxe-Weimar, Saxe-Gotha, Palatinate-Zweibrücken, Brunswick, Baden, Hesse-Kassel, Anhalt, Ansbach, Mecklenburg, the electorate of Mainz, and other lesser states—to join a league in opposition to Joseph. Joseph was daunted and dropped his Bavarian designs rather than risk another military defeat at the hands of Prussia. Although only temporary, the league represented the first organization of German states headed by Prussia, the state that later unified Germany, as well as another sign of the Holy Roman Empire’s ebbing influence on German affairs.
