Treaty of Bassein,  (Dec. 31, 1802), pact between Baji Rao II, the Maratha peshwa of Poona (now Pune) in India, and the British. It was a decisive step in the breakup of the Maratha confederacy. The pact led directly to the East India Company’s annexation of the peshwa’s territories in western India in 1818. The Maratha confederacy was distracted by dissensions following the death in 1800 of the peshwa’s minister Nana Fadnavis. The military chiefs Daulat Rao Sindhia and Jaswant Rao Holkar (Hulkar), both with disciplined forces at their back, contended for the control of the peshwa. In October 1802 Holkar defeated Sindhia and the peshwa and installed an adopted brother on the throne of Pune. Baji Rao fled to Bassein and appealed for British help.
By the Treaty of Bassein, the peshwa agreed to maintain a British subsidiary force of six battalions, for whose upkeep territory was ceded; to exclude all Europeans from his service; to give up his claims on Surat and Baroda; and to conduct his foreign relations in consultation with the British. In return, Arthur Wellesley (later 1st duke of Wellington) restored the peshwa to Pune in May 1803. The leading Maratha state had thus become a client of the British. This treaty led to the Second Maratha War (1803–05), between the British and the Marathas, and to the defeat of the three other principal Maratha powers.
