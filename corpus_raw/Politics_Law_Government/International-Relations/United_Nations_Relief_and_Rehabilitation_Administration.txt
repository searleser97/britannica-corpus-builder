United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA),  administrative body (1943–47) for an extensive social-welfare program that assisted nations ravaged by World War II. Created on Nov. 9, 1943, by a 44-nation agreement, its operations concentrated on distributing relief supplies, such as food, clothing, fuel, shelter, and medicines; providing relief services, with trained personnel; and aiding agricultural and economic rehabilitation. In addition, it also provided camps, personnel, and food for the care and repatriation of millions of displaced persons and refugees after the war. UNRRA discontinued its activities in 1947; unfinished projects were turned over to the International Refugee Organization, the World Health Organization, and the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (now the United Nations Children’s Fund).
