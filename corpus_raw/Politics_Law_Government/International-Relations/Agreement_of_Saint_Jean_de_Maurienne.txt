Agreement of Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne,  (April 1917), pact concluded at Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne, on the French-Italian border, between Great Britain, France, and Italy to reconcile conflicting claims of France and Italy over southwestern Anatolia in the event of dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire at the end of World War I, then in progress.
Under its terms France would be allotted the Adana region, while Italy would receive the remainder of southwestern Anatolia, including İzmir (Smyrna). The agreement was endorsed (Aug. 18–Sept. 26, 1917) by the three powers, subject to the assent of Russia, which, because of the collapse of the tsarist regime, was not represented at Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne.
In 1919 the Greek prime minister, Eleuthérios Venizélos, by obtaining the permission of the Paris Peace Conference for Greece to occupy İzmir, overrode the provisions of the agreement despite Italian opposition.
