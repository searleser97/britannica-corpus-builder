Treaty of Riga,  (1921) treaty between Poland and Russia signed in Riga, Latvia, that ended the Russo-Polish War of 1919â€“20 and set their mutual border. The treaty, which gave Poland parts of Belorussia (now Belarus) and Ukraine, lasted until World War II, after which a new treaty established a new border.
