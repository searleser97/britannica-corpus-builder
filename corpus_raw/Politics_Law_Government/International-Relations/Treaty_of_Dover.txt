Treaty of Dover,  (1670), pact by which Charles II of England promised to support French policy in Europe in return for a French subsidy that would free him from financial dependence on Parliament.
There were actually two treaties of Dover in 1670: one, which was secret (and known to only two of Charles’s councillors) was concerned with the conversion of England to the Roman Catholic faith, which was favoured by Charles II; and the other, which was formal, was concerned with an Anglo-French military and naval alliance designed to subjugate the United Provinces of the Netherlands, which was desired by Louis XIV. The secret treaty—in the negotiation of which Charles’s sister Henrietta Anna, duchesse d’Orléans, was deeply involved—was concluded on June 1 (May 22, old style). By it, Charles II was to receive £200,000 in money and the support of 6,000 French troops, if needed, so that he might declare himself a Roman Catholic, and a further £300,000 a year to enable him to join a war against the Dutch. Among other clauses it was stipulated that England would support any claims that Louis might get to the Spanish succession. To allay suspicion, the formal treaty was concluded through the ordinary diplomatic channels on December 31 (December 21, old style), omitting all mention of religion.
The conversion clause never came into effect, for Louis XIV was really interested only in war, and Charles II’s ambition was not so much the restoration of the Catholic religion as the establishment of the monarchical power that he thought Catholicism would secure. Charles came to promote that religion instead by a policy of religious toleration.
