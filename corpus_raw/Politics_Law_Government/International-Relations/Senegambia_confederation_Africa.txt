Senegambia,  limited confederation (1982–89) of the sovereign countries of Senegal and The Gambia. The two countries reached a merger agreement in November 1981, and the Senegambia confederation came into being three months later. The terms of the agreement required Senegal and The Gambia to take the following steps toward union: integrate their military and security forces; form an economic and monetary union; coordinate their foreign policies and communications; and establish confederal institutions. The larger Senegal would dominate these institutions, controlling the confederal presidency and two-thirds of the seats in a confederal parliament. Despite the merger, each country would maintain its independence. In July 1982 Senegal and The Gambia began implementing the agreement, and a Senegambian executive and legislature were established. The Gambia’s growing concern over its autonomy, however, led to the dissolution of the confederation in 1989.
