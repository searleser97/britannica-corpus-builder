North German Confederation, German Norddeutscher Bund,  union of the German states north of the Main River formed in 1867 under Prussian hegemony after Prussia’s victory over Austria in the Seven Weeks’ War (1866). Berlin was its capital, the king of Prussia was its president, and the Prussian chancellor was also its chancellor. Its constitution served as a model for that of the German Empire, with which it merged in 1871.
