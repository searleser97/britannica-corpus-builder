Treaty of Rome, originally (1957–93)  Treaty Establishing the European Economic Community, succeeded by (1993–2009) Treaty Establishing the European Community and (2009– )  Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union; also called, together with the Treaty Establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, Treaties of Rome,  international agreement, signed in Rome on March 25, 1957, by Belgium, France, the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany), Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, that established the European Economic Community (EEC), creating a common market and customs union among its members. The Treaty Establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, for the purpose of developing peaceful applications of atomic energy, was signed by the same countries on the same day, and therefore the two treaties together are often called the Treaties of Rome. Following the advent of the European Union (EU) in 1993, the treaty that had established the EEC remained one of the EU’s core documents, though the EEC itself was renamed the European Community (EC), and the EC was embedded into the EU. With the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty in 2009, the EC was eliminated, and the Treaty of Rome that had established it was formally renamed the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.
