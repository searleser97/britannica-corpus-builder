Lifan Yuan, Wade-Giles romanization Li-fan Yüan,  government bureau established in the 17th century by China’s Qing (Manchu) dynasty to handle relations with the peoples of Inner Asia. It signified the growing interest of China in Central Asia.
The office appointed governors to supervise Chinese territory in Central Asia and Tibet, granted permits to merchants to trade in these areas, took charge of Russian students and traders who came to China, and supervised the Russian religious mission in Beijing. In 1861 responsibility for Russian affairs was taken over by the newly created foreign office, the Zongli Yamen. The Lifan Yuan continued in existence until 1907, when it was reorganized as the Ministry of Dependencies.
