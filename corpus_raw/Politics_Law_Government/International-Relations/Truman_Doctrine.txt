Truman Doctrine,  pronouncement by U.S. Pres. Harry S. Truman declaring immediate economic and military aid to the governments of Greece, threatened by communist insurrection, and Turkey, under pressure from Soviet expansion in the Mediterranean area.

Congress responded to Trumanâ€™s message by promptly appropriating $400 million to support Greece and Turkey.
