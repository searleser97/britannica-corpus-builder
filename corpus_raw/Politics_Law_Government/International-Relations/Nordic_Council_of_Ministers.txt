Nordic Council of Ministers,   organization of the Nordic states of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden for the purpose of consultation and cooperation on matters of common interest. The Council was established in February 1971 under an amendment to the Helsinki Convention (1962) between the Nordic countries. It consists of the ministers of state of the member countries, as well as other ministers with responsibility for the subject under discussion. Formal decisions are usually binding on the member governments. The Council of Ministers provides funds for a large number of joint Nordic institutions and projects in such fields as investment finance, scientific research and development, culture, education, and social welfare and health. A related organization, the Nordic Council, serves as an advisory body.
