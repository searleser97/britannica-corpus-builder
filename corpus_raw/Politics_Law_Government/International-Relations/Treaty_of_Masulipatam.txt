Treaty of Masulipatam,  (Feb. 23, 1768), agreement by which the state of Hyderabad, India, submitted to British control. The First Mysore War began in 1767 and concerned the East India Companyâ€™s attempts to check the expansionary policies of the ruler of Mysore, Hyder Ali. Although originally allied to the British, the nizam of Hyderabad soon deserted his British allies and then finally made peace with them at Masulipatam when the British recognized the nizam as ruler of Balaghat. At the conclusion of the war in 1769, however, the British recognized the sovereignty of Mysore over Hyderabad. The double cross eventually prompted the nizam to join in a confederacy with Hyder Ali against the British in 1779, but the subsequent war ended in the solidification of British control over both Mysore and Hyderabad.
