Treaty of Breda,  (July 31, 1667), treaty between England, the Dutch Republic, France, and Denmark, which brought to an inconclusive end the second Anglo-Dutch War (1665–67), in which France and Denmark had supported the Dutch. The Dutch had the military advantage during the war (fought mostly at sea) but were compelled to make peace quickly to deal with Louis XIV’s invasion of the Spanish Netherlands in the War of Devolution. The English Navigation Acts were changed in favour of the Dutch to permit Dutch ships to carry to England goods that had come down the Rhine River. Several Dutch trading principles were accepted, including confining the definition of “contraband” to implements of war. The Dutch position in world trade had not been shaken, and England had failed to take over a part of the spice trade. England, however, received the New Netherland (New York, New Jersey) and some outposts in Africa from the Dutch, and recovered Antigua, Montserrat, and St. Kitts, in the West Indies, from France. The Dutch retained Surinam and, in the East Indies, Pulo Run. France retained French Guiana and recovered Acadia from England.
