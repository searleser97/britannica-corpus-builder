Treaty of Bucharest,  settlement, signed on Aug. 10, 1913, that ended the Second Balkan War (1913), in which Bulgaria was defeated by the combined forces of Serbia, Greece, and Romania. Bulgaria had unsuccessfully contested the distribution by its former allies of territory taken from the Turks during the First Balkan War (1912–13). According to the terms of the treaty, Bulgaria was granted a small portion of Macedonia and a strip of Aegean coastline including the port of Dedeağaç (Alexandroúpolis). Serbia took northern and central Macedonia; Greece acquired southern Macedonia; and Romania was given southern Dobruja.
