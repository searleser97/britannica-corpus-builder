Center for International Policy (CIP),  privately funded nongovernmental organization dedicated to promoting a U.S. foreign policy that is based on demilitarization, international cooperation, and respect for human rights. Headquarters are in Washington, D.C.
The CIP was created in 1975 by former diplomats and peace activists who opposed U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. The group formed alliances with members of Congress and was influential in a number of notable foreign-policy achievements, including making sure the U.S. government considered a country’s human rights record when allocating foreign aid and ensuring the acceptance by four Central American countries of the peace plan conceived in the 1980s by Costa Rican Pres. Oscar Arias.
In 2002 the CIP created the Win Without War coalition in response to anticipated U.S. military involvement in Iraq after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Win Without War was opposed to the George W. Bush administration’s doctrine of unilateral preemptive military attack and sought the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq once the Iraq War had been launched.
The CIP also created the Avoided Deforestation Partners group, a coalition of international groups opposed to tropical deforestation. Other programs associated with the CIP include the Global Financial Integrity program, which seeks to stop the international flow of illicit funds, and several programs dedicated to regional security. The CIP is funded by donations from businesses, religious organizations, foundations, and individuals. It does not accept government or political funding.
