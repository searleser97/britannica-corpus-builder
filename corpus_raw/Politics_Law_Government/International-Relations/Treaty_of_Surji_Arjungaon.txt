Treaty of Surji-Arjungaon,  (Dec. 30, 1803), settlement between the Maratha chief Daulat Rao Sindhia and the British, the result of Lord Lake’s campaign in upper India in the first phase of the Second Maratha War (1803–05).
Lake captured Aligarh and defeated Sindhia’s French-trained army at Delhi and Laswari (September–November 1803). By this treaty the Mughal emperor Shah ʿĀlam II passed under British protection; the Ganges-Yamuna doab (territory between the rivers), Agra, and Sindhia’s territories in Gohad and Gujarat were entrusted to the British East India Company; and Sindhia’s control over Rajasthan was relaxed. In addition, Sindhia received a British resident and signed a defensive treaty.
In November 1805 the defensive treaty was revised by the acting governor-general, Sir George Barlow, in accordance with the British policy of withdrawal. Gwalior and Gohad were restored to Sindhia, the defensive treaty was abrogated, and the East India Company’s protectorate over Rajasthan was withdrawn.
On Nov. 5, 1817, the treaty was again revised under pressure from the British on the eve of the Third Maratha War. Sindhia promised to help the British against the Pindari marauders and surrendered his rights in Rajasthan. Shortly afterward, British treaties of protection were concluded with 19 Rajput states.
