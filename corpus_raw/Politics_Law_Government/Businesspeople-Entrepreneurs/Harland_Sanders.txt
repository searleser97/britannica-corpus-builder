Harland Sanders, byname Colonel Sanders,  (born September 9, 1890, near Henryville, Indiana, U.S.—died  December 16, 1980, Shelbyville, Kentucky), American business executive, a dapper self-styled Southern gentleman whose white hair, white goatee, white double-breasted suits, and black string ties became a trademark in countries worldwide for Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Sanders, who quit school in seventh grade, held a variety of jobs before opening (1929) Sanders’ Cafe in the rear of a service station in Corbin, Kentucky. The cafe, which offered family-style dinners, soon gained a large clientele; and in 1935 Sanders received his honorary colonel’s title from the governor of Kentucky. He perfected his recipe for “finger lickin’ good chicken” in 1939 by using a secret blend of 11 spices and a pressure cooker to seal in flavour and moisture. After selling his restaurant, Sanders took to the road armed with his recipe but signed up only five restaurants in two years. By 1964, however, there were more than 600 franchises in the United States and Canada, and Sanders was making $300,000 a year.
In the same year, Sanders signed most of his fast-food empire over to John Brown of Kentucky and Jack Massey of Tennessee, providing that he received $2,000,000, a lifetime salary of $40,000 a year, and a seat on the board of directors. In 1971 the company, which boasted 3,500 franchises and $700,000,000 a year in business, was acquired by Heublein Corporation. Sanders remained active as an official ambassador and appeared in advertisements and commercials for the company even as a nonagenarian.
