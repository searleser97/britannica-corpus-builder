Otto Frank,  (born May 12, 1889, Frankfurt am Main, Germany—died August 20, 1980, Basel, Switzerland), German-born merchant best known as the father of Anne Frank, whose diary, published after her death in 1945, became world famous.
Frank, decorated for bravery as a German officer in World War I, escaped with his family from the Nazi anti-Jewish persecutions in Germany before the outbreak of World War II. Living in Amsterdam, he and his family went into hiding in 1942 to avoid deportation from the Netherlands, which was occupied by Germany in 1940. Their hiding place in the “Secret Annex”—a cramped space that the Franks shared with Auguste and Hermann van Pels and their son, Peter, and a dentist, Fritz Pfeffer—was betrayed by an informant, and they were discovered. They were arrested on August 4, 1944, and sent to Auschwitz, where they were separated. Anne and her elder sister, Margot, were moved to the Nazi concentration camp at Bergen-Belsen, where they both died of typhus in March 1945. Their mother died in Auschwitz, but Frank was freed by the Soviets in January 1945. He returned to Amsterdam, where Miep Gies (who had smuggled food and supplies to the Secret Annex) gave him the remains of Anne’s diary that had been recovered after the family’s capture. Although he was reluctant to do so, Frank was persuaded to publish the diary, which he edited, in 1947. It was later translated into more than 65 languages, dramatized, and filmed. Frank, who moved to Switzerland in the 1950s, turned over all the proceeds from the diary’s sales to the Anne Frank Foundation in Amsterdam.
