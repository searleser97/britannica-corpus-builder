Henry Clay Folger, in full Henry Clay Folger, Jr.,  (born June 18, 1857, New York, NewYork, U.S.—died June 11, 1930, Brooklyn, NewYork), American lawyer and  business executive who is chiefly remembered as the founder of the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C.
Henry’s father of the same name was a ninth-generation descendant of the Nantucket settler Peter Folger, whose daughter, Abiah, was Benjamin Franklin’s mother. Henry Jr. was a nephew of J.A. Folger, the founder of Folgers Coffee. Henry attended Adelphi Academy in Brooklyn before entering Amherst College in 1875. At Amherst Folger won prizes in English composition and oratory, sang in the glee club and in a fraternity quartet, and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. It was there that he developed an interest in William Shakespeare, which deepened during his senior year after he heard a lecture by Ralph Waldo Emerson.
Upon his graduation from Amherst in 1879, Folger took nighttime classes in law at Columbia University (LL.B., 1881) while working as a clerk for Charles Pratt & Company, part of the Standard Oil group of companies. In 1908 he became a director of the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, and in 1911 he became president of Standard Oil Company of New York. Under his direction the firm prospered, and he was made chairman of the board in 1923. He retired in 1928.
He and his wife, Emily Jordan Folger (1858–1936), planned for nine years to build a library of Shakespearean materials on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., and in 1928 the U.S. Congress approved their project, thereby permitting the Folgers to purchase land that had been intended for the expansion of the Library of Congress. Although Henry died just as construction began in 1930, Emily oversaw the completion of the library and assisted with funding in the midst of the Great Depression, personally contributing millions of dollars to the completion of the project. She remained active with the library until her death in 1936.
