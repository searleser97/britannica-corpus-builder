Fred Harvey, byname of Frederick Henry Harvey,  (born 1835, London, Eng.—died  Feb. 9, 1901, Leavenworth, Kan., U.S.), American restaurateur, who operated a chain of restaurants along the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad, each called the Harvey House and often staffed by “Harvey Girls.”
Harvey emigrated from Liverpool, Eng., to New York City in 1850 and began working in restaurants there and in New Orleans. He opened a restaurant in St. Louis, and when it failed he worked as a freight agent for a railroad and traveled throughout the Great Plains. Observing that the dining accommodations for railroad passengers in the American West were primitive and of extremely poor quality, Harvey in 1876 entered into an agreement with the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad to operate a restaurant at that railroad’s depot in Topeka, Kan. Harvey’s efforts to provide well-prepared meals in attractive settings proved immediately popular, and demand was such that within a few years he had opened several more restaurants at various Santa Fe Railroad depots. As his chain of Harvey House restaurants became famous for their appetizing cuisine, Harvey began establishing a series of clean, efficient hotels and then a string of railroad dining cars. By the time of his death, his enterprises included 47 restaurants, 30 dining cars, and 15 hotels. The hundreds (eventually thousands) of young women that Harvey brought out west to staff his restaurants eventually provided wives for many bachelors there. The humorist Will Rogers memorialized Harvey by saying that he “kept the West in food and wives.”
