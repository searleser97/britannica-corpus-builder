Leo Burnett,  (born Oct. 21, 1891, St. Johns, Mich., U.S.—died  June 7, 1971, Lake Zurich, Ill.), pioneer American advertising executive who founded a worldwide agency that ranks among the giants of the industry.
Burnett was a journalism major at the University of Michigan, who got his first job as a reporter on the Peoria (Ill.) Journal. He then wrote advertising copy for two auto manufacturers and for two advertising agencies before starting his own firm in 1935. By 1948 the firm’s billings (i.e., commissionable advertising expenditures by its clients) exceeded $10,000,000 and a decade later, $90,000,000.
Burnett was one of the developers of what has been called the “Chicago school of advertising.” Its objective was to build an advertisement around the inherent importance or appeal of a product itself rather than around clever copy or a catchy slogan. He detested “slick” advertising that he felt was typical of New York agencies or “opportunistic” copy from—as he saw it—the U.S. West Coast. He occasionally scrapped an advertising campaign that had been accepted by a client because he was not satisfied with its quality.
It was Burnett’s antagonism toward slickness that moved him to employ models who looked like ordinary people instead of movie stars, and this approach led him in 1954 to the cowboys in Marlboro cigarette ads for the Philip Morris Company, a campaign that turned a minor cigarette with a feminine image into a major brand with a rugged male image. Burnett also served at various times as a director and as chairman of the Advertising Council.
