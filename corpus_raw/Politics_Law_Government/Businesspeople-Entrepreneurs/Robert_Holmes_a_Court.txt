Robert Holmes à Court, in full Michael Robert Hamilton Holmes À Court,  (born July 27, 1937, Johannesburg, S. Afr.—died  Sept. 2, 1990, Heytesbury, near Perth, Western Australia), Australian entrepreneur nicknamed “the Great Acquirer” for his billion-dollar raids on major companies in England and Australia.
Holmes à Court received his early schooling in South Africa, moved with his family to New Zealand in the 1950s, and earned degrees in agricultural science at Massey University (1962) and in law at the University of Western Australia, Perth (1965). He became a barrister and solicitor. In 1970 he acquired Western Australia Worsted and Woollen Mills, a failing company that he had advised; he revived it and made it his vehicle for acquiring (1973) a declining freight and civil engineering firm that he turned into Bell Group Ltd. This firm became the cornerstone of his financial empire, which included interests in Texaco, Sears, and Standard Chartered Bank.
After heavy losses in the 1987 stock market crash, Holmes à Court formed the private Heytesbury Holdings Ltd. and began to rebuild. At his death his empire included 13 West End (London) theatres; interests in the transportation, media, and building-supplies industries; a network of thoroughbred stud farms; and Australia’s largest cattle ranch.
