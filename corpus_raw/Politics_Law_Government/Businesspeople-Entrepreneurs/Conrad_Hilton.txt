Conrad Hilton, in full Conrad Nicholson Hilton,  (born Dec. 25, 1887, San Antonio, N.M., U.S.—died  Jan. 3, 1979, Santa Monica, Calif.), American businessman and founder of one of the world’s largest hotel organizations.
As a boy in the little New Mexican desert town of San Antonio, Hilton helped his enterprising father turn the family’s large adobe house into an inn for traveling salesmen. By 1915 he was president as well as partner in the A.H. Hilton and Son general store. He served a term in the state legislature and went to France as a second lieutenant in World War I.
After his father’s death in 1918, Hilton sought to continue expansion of the family business. In Cisco, Texas, where he had gone to negotiate purchase of a bank, he bought the Mobley Hotel. Finding the hotel business lucrative, he bought others in Dallas, Fort Worth, Waco, and elsewhere in Texas. The depression of the 1930s hurt but did not destroy the Hilton chain, and by 1939 he was building, leasing, or buying (and sometimes selling) hotels in California, New York, Illinois, and elsewhere. In 1946 the Hilton Hotels Corporation was formed, followed in 1948 by the Hilton International Company, as he expanded his operations to other countries. In 1954 he bought the Statler Hotel chain. Diversification included a credit corporation, the origin of Carte Blanche credit cards, and a car-rental corporation.
By the 1960s the company reorganized its foreign operations, going into partnership with outside corporations and foreign governments. Many Hilton hotels became franchises or were only partially owned by the Hilton chain. Conrad Hilton was succeeded as president of the corporation by his son Barron in 1966.
Hilton was author of Be My Guest (1957) and Inspirations of an Innkeeper (1963).
