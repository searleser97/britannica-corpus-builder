Charles E. Mitchell,  (born Oct. 6, 1877, Chelsea, Mass., U.S.—died  Dec. 14, 1955, New York, N.Y.), American banker and chairman of the National City organization.
Mitchell took his first job with the Western Electric Company in Chicago and became the president’s assistant in 1903. Three years later he left the firm and became assistant to the president at The Trust Company of America in New York City, a position he held for five years. Mitchell formed his own investment house, C.E. Mitchell & Co., in 1911. Five years later he took part in the reorganization of the National City Company, which oversaw investments for the National City Bank, and he soon became its president. The company was capitalized at $55,000,000 and had 50 offices throughout the world. Mitchell also became president of the National City Bank of New York and maintained both positions until 1929. He resigned them to head the National City organization, the parent company for several banks and financial institutions.
After the collapse of the stock market in 1929, Mitchell became a major target for government investigations. He left his posts at National City when it was disclosed that he had made illegal stock transactions, speculated in his own bank’s securities, and engaged in income tax evasion. The passage of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Banking Acts of 1933 and 1935 was largely in response to Mitchellʾs example of financial chicanery.
After resigning from the National City organization, Mitchell founded his own financial consulting firm, C.E. Mitchell, Inc. At the same time, he assumed the position of chairman of the board for the investment banking firm of Blyth & Co.
