Charles Eugene Bedaux,  (born Oct. 26, 1887, Charonton, near Paris, France—died  Feb. 18, 1944, Miami, Fla., U.S.), French-born American efficiency engineer who developed the Bedaux plan for measuring and compensating industrial labour.
Bedaux immigrated to the United States at the age of about 20 and became a naturalized citizen in 1917. During and after World War I he organized management consulting firms in both North America and Europe. Bedaux’s wage-incentive plan measured productivity in Bedaux units, one unit indicating the work to be done by one man in one minute. A bonus was paid for work done in excess of 60 units per hour. This plan was widely used to improve labour productivity and management efficiency, but unions were critical of its complexity and of the speed-up that sometimes resulted from the use of improper standards.
In 1937 Bedaux gave up management of his American management consultant enterprises, settled in France, and collaborated with the Nazis and the Vichy French government during World War II. He was arrested in Algiers during the Allied invasion of North Africa and was returned to the United States, where he committed suicide after having been charged with treason.
