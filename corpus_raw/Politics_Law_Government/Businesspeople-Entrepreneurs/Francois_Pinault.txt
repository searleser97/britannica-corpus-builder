François Pinault,  (born Aug. 21, 1936, Champs Géraux, Côtes-du-Nord, France), French businessman and art collector who created a retail empire, especially noted for its luxury goods.
Pinault’s earliest jobs were with his father’s timber company; in 1963 he founded Société Pinault, a timber and building materials firm (reorganized as Pinault SA in 1988). Pinault acquired department store Au Printemps SA in 1992, and, after purchasing mail-order company La Redoute, he formed Pinault-Printemps-Redoute in 1994 (renamed PPR in 2005). Working through his holding company, Artémis SA (founded in 1992), he added a wide range of firms. Pinault’s purchase of a nearly 30 percent stake in British auction house Christie’s in 1998 signaled his shift toward expensive brands—and affirmed his interest in art. After acquiring 42 percent of luxury-goods retailer Gucci Group NV in 1992, Pinault transformed it into a luxury-brand conglomerate, and in 2004 he gained a controlling stake. His American holdings included Samsonite luggage and a ski resort in Vail, Colo.
Pinault was also an avid art collector, and by the early 21st century he had acquired some 3,000 works. After efforts to build a museum in France failed, Pinault in 2005 bought the Palazzo Grassi in Venice, and the following year he began displaying a small percentage of his collection—including works by Cindy Sherman and Jeff Koons—at the villa. In 2007 Pinault and the Palazzo Grassi were selected to create a contemporary art museum at the Punta della Dogana, an unused Venetian customs house on the Grand Canal. The museum, with an interior designed by Japanese architect Ando Tadao, opened in 2009 and housed a number of works from Pinault’s collection.
