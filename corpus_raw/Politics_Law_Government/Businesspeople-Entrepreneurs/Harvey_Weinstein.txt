Harvey Weinstein,  (born March 19, 1952, Flushing, Queens, New York, U.S.), American film producer who—with his brother, Bob—was cofounder and cochairman of Miramax Films (1979–2005) and later the Weinstein Company (2005–17). Once a powerful figure in Hollywood, his career was halted amid numerous allegations of sexual harassment and assault.
Weinstein attended the University of Buffalo, New York, where he began promoting rock concerts with his brother. Their interests soon turned to movies, and in 1979 the brothers established the Miramax Film Corp. (named after their parents, Miriam and Max) and began buying the rights to films and distributing them. Weinstein proved to be a risk taker, purchasing films that were quirky and often controversial, and in 1989 he bought the rights to the provocative sex, lies, and videotape, which became Miramax’s first major hit.
The company’s presence continued to grow in the early 1990s as the brothers began producing more films, and Harvey, who was the more flamboyant and outgoing of the two, became the public face of Miramax. In 1993 the Walt Disney Company purchased the company for an estimated $60 million, but the brothers continued as cochairmen. A string of acclaimed films followed, including Quentin Tarantino’s Pulp Fiction (1994) and Smoke (1995), and in 1997 Weinstein and Miramax won their first Academy Award for best picture for The English Patient (1996). Weinstein released a series of highly successful films—most notably Good Will Hunting (1997), Shakespeare in Love (1998; Academy Award for best picture), and The Cider House Rules (1999)—and by the late 1990s his movies had garnered nearly 40 Oscars.
As Miramax evolved from a distributor into a ministudio—with annual box-office receipts of more than $1 billion—Weinstein began to position the company as an entertainment empire. A television division was launched in 1998, and the following year Talk magazine, a joint venture with Hearst Publishing, hit the newsstands. In 2000 Talk Miramax Books was established. As the new ventures struggled, however, some believed that the diversion of Weinstein’s attention was causing the film division to suffer, and in 2002 Miramax received only one Academy Award. That year also saw the end of Talk magazine. In 2003, however, Weinstein’s films were nominated for 40 Academy Awards—the most nominations received by a studio in more than 60 years—and ended up winning 9 awards, including the best picture nod for Chicago (2002). Later films distributed by Weinstein through Miramax Films included Fahrenheit 9/11 (2004), a documentary by Michael Moore, and Finding Neverland (2004), in which Johnny Depp starred as James M. Barrie.
In 2005 Harvey and Bob left Miramax Films to form the Weinstein Company. The company’s early notable releases included Grindhouse (2007), which consisted of two feature-length films directed by Robert Rodriguez (Planet Terror) and Tarantino (Death Proof); I’m Not There (2007), an unconventional biopic of Bob Dylan; and The Great Debaters (2007), a drama—directed by and starring Denzel Washington—about an underdog debate team from an African American college that competed against Harvard for the 1935 national championship. The Weinstein Company later released such Oscar-winning films as the Holocaust-themed The Reader (2008), the Woody Allen comedy Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008), Tarantino’s Inglourious Basterds (2009) and Django Unchained (2012), the historical drama The King’s Speech (2010), the silent-film homage The Artist (2011), and The Imitation Game (2014), a biopic about Alan Turing.
In October 2017 reports emerged of numerous sexual harassment and assault allegations against Harvey Weinstein, which spanned decades. He initially took a leave of absence from the Weinstein Company, but within days he was fired. Shortly thereafter he was expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Authorities in New York launched an investigation into Weinstein, and in May 2018 he was charged with several crimes, including rape, in connection to incidents involving two different women. Weinstein pled not guilty to those charges as well as to others that were subsequently filed. His trial began in January 2020, and the following month he was found guilty of a criminal sexual act and rape. He was sentenced to 23 years in prison.
