William Stephenson, byname Intrepid,  (born Jan. 11, 1896, Point Douglas, Man., Can.—died  Jan. 31, 1989, Paget, Bermuda), Canadian-born millionaire industrialist whose role as Britain’s intelligence chief in the Western Hemisphere in World War II was chronicled in A Man Called Intrepid (1979).
The son of a lumber-mill owner, Stephenson dropped out of college to serve in the Royal Canadian Engineers (1914–15) and the British Royal Flying Corps (1915–18) in France. After the war he pursued various business ventures and inventions and launched himself on a career as an industrialist, manufacturing such diverse products as radios, phonographs, automobiles, and airplanes; he also moved into construction, real estate, and steel. Through his many business contacts, Stephenson gained valuable information in the 1930s about the buildup of German armaments and the development of the cipher machine Enigma. He conveyed this information to the British secret service. When Winston Churchill became prime minister in 1940, he sent Stephenson to New York City to direct the U.S.-based British Security Coordination (BSC). Stephenson coordinated all British overseas espionage activities in the Western Hemisphere, recruited agents, established a secret base in Canada to train agents for missions behind enemy lines, and functioned as liaison between the BSC and the U.S. government until the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) assumed responsibility for U.S. intelligence in 1942. Stephenson himself financed many of the BSC’s operations. He was knighted in 1945.
After the war Stephenson returned to his business interests, operating mainly from Jamaica; he retired to Bermuda in 1968.
