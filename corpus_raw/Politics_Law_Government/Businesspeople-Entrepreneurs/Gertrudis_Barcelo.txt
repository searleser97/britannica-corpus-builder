Gertrudis Barcelo, in full Maria Gertrudis Barcelo,  (born 1800, Sonora state, Mexico—died 1852, Santa Fe, N.M., U.S.),  Mexican-born businesswoman who built her fortune through casinos and trade ventures in the early American Southwest.
Barcelo’s wealthy parents saw that she received an education, and in the early 1820s the family moved to a small village just south of Albuquerque, which at the time was part of Mexico. As a result of her upbringing and education, Barcelo grew to be an unusually independent and financially astute woman. When she married at age 23, she—contrary to custom—retained her own property, her right to make contracts, and her maiden name. She and her husband moved to the Santa Fe area in 1825 and established a highly profitable game-of-chance operation near a mining camp. Several years later Barcelo bought her own casino in Santa Fe. The opulent casino soon became a favourite with Santa Fe’s fashionable society, with Barcelo, who became known as “La Tules,” presiding as one of the dealers. As Santa Fe was a trade hub, Barcelo further increased her wealth and status through shrewd trade deals and investments.
After the United States declared war on Mexico, an American civilian government established itself in Santa Fe in 1846. Barcelo sided with the Americans during the war; she uncovered a conspiracy and reported it to American officials and even loaned money to the occupying forces so they could buy provisions. After the war ended in 1848, New Mexico became a part of the United States. Barcelo continued operating her gambling hall, but it was no longer the elite rendezvous it had once been. Outwardly, the new Anglo leaders held Barcelo in disdain, but they nonetheless accepted her offers of financial support and acknowledged her as a person of considerable influence among the native Mexican population.
