Simon McKeon,  (born December 19, 1955, Dandenong, Victoria, Australia), Australian philanthropist and investment banker who was named Australian of the Year in 2011 in recognition of his involvement in a variety of charitable organizations.
McKeon studied at the University of Melbourne, where he earned bachelor’s degrees in commerce (1976) and law (1978). After working in Sydney as an attorney for the law firm Blake Dawson Waldron, he joined the Macquarie Group in 1984, serving as executive chairman of the Melbourne office and specializing in mergers and acquisitions. Aside from building a successful business career, McKeon also became an accomplished yachtsman, teaming in 1993 with copilot Tim Daddo to set a 500-metre world speed sailing record (46.52 knots) that lasted for more than a decade.
In 1994 McKeon reduced his hours at Macquarie in order to focus on philanthropy. As the director (1994–2005) of World Vision Australia, he oversaw the country’s largest humanitarian organization. Despite being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) in 2001—which for a time left McKeon blind and paralyzed from the waist down—he continued to pursue charitable work. After guiding the establishment of MS Research Australia, he served as its first chairman (2004–10). His other notable posts included chairman of Business for Millennium Development, an organization that encouraged Australian companies to create economic opportunities for the poor; director of Red Dust Role Models, a mentoring group that aided disadvantaged youths living in remote Australian communities; and a director of the Global Poverty Project. From 2010 to 2015 he served as chairman of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, the national science agency of Australia. McKeon became chancellor of Monash University in 2016.
