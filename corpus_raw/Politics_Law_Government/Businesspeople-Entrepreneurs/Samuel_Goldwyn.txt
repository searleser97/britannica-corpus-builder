Samuel Goldwyn, original name Schmuel Gelbfisz,  also called Samuel Goldfish,  (born July 1879, Warsaw, Poland, Russian Empire—died  Jan. 31, 1974, Los Angeles, Calif., U.S.), pioneer American filmmaker and one of Hollywood’s most prominent producers for more than 30 years.
Orphaned as a child, Goldwyn emigrated first to London and eventually to a small town in New York state, where he worked in a glove factory. By the age of 18 he was one of the top glove salesmen in the world and a partner in his company. With his brother-in-law Jesse Lasky, then a vaudeville producer, he cofounded the Jesse Lasky Feature Play Company. Their initial release was Cecil B. deMille’s Squaw Man (1913), one of the first full-length feature films made in Hollywood. In 1917 the company merged with Adolph Zukor’s Famous Players Film Company, and Goldwyn became the chairman of the board of the Famous Players–Lasky Company. That same year he established the Goldwyn Pictures Corporation, which was incorporated into Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1924. He thereafter worked as an independent producer, distributing his films through the United Artists Corporation until 1940, then through RKO.
As a producer Goldwyn made it a practice to hire the finest writers, directors, actors, and cinematographers available, and consequently his pictures maintained a high level of excellence. Many of his films have a literary flavour, among them Dodsworth (1936), Wuthering Heights (1939), and The Little Foxes (1941). He is also remembered for more purely cinematic features, such as The Best Years of Our Lives (1946), and a series of Technicolor musicals, such as Guys and Dolls (1955) and Porgy and Bess (1959). He was instrumental in introducing to films such stars as Bebe Daniels, Pola Negri, Will Rogers, Vilma Banky, and Ronald Colman. Malapropos but expressive “Goldwynisms”—such as “Include me out”—were widely quoted and attributed to him, often apocryphally.
