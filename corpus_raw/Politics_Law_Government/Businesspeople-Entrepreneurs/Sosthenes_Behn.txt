Sosthenes Behn,  (born Jan. 30, 1882, St. Thomas, Danish Virgin Islands—died  June 6, 1957, New York City), telephone executive, president and founder, with his brother Hernand, of the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation (itt), one of the largest communications companies in the world.
Educated on the island of Corsica and in Paris, Behn began his career in 1901 with a New York City bank. Five years later he and his brother Hernand took over the sugar business of their stepfather in Puerto Rico and, while living on that island, purchased the Puerto Rican Telephone Company; they later acquired the Cuban Telephone Company. The brothers’ business activities were interrupted by World War I; Behn served in the United States Army Signal Corps.
In 1920 the Behns and a third partner organized Itt, into which they incorporated their Puerto Rican and Cuban holdings. They later obtained telephone concessions for Spain and Romania. The onset of the depression in 1931 brought financial difficulties, but Behn’s skillful handling of the firm’s indebtedness enabled Itt to survive and grow. Hernand died in 1933, leaving his brother in full control. World War II brought more problems when certain European holdings were seized by Adolf Hitler; nevertheless, the company was able to sell its Romanian holdings and in 1945–46 disposed successfully of properties in Spain and Argentina. Operations in Latin America were expanded both during and after the war. Behn retired in 1956.
