Hayami Masaru,  (born March 24, 1925, Kobe, Japan—died May 16, 2009, Tokyo), Japanese banker and business executive who, as governor (1998–2003) of the Bank of Japan (BOJ), introduced striking reforms to the country’s banking system.
Hayami graduated from the Tokyo University of Commerce in 1947 and joined the BOJ that year. He remained with the central bank for the next 34 years. In 1967 Hayami was named manager of the bank’s Ōita branch, and four years later he became the BOJ’s chief representative in Europe. He was appointed director of the foreign department in 1975. After another stint as a branch manager—this time in Nagoya from 1976 to 1978—he was named an executive director, a position he held for three years.
In 1981 Hayami left the BOJ to take a position as senior managing director at the trading firm Nissho Iwai Corporation. He rose to become president of the firm in 1984 and served as its chairman from 1987 to 1994. During his tenure at Nissho Iwai, he also headed the Japan Association of Corporate Executives (Keizai Doyukai), one of the country’s most prominent business organizations. From 1992 until his appointment as BOJ governor in 1998, he served as chairman of the board of trustees at Tokyo Women’s Christian University.
As the new governor of the BOJ, Hayami was charged with restoring the institution’s prestige; his predecessor, Yasuo Matsushita, had resigned over a bribery scandal. Along with his sterling credentials as a banker, Hayami brought to the job a market-oriented philosophy and a reformist agenda. In the wake of an economic downturn that had gripped Japan since the early 1990s, he stressed the need for starting the process of corporate restructuring and helping banks rid themselves of their nonperforming loans. To that end, he cut interest rates to zero in 1999, and in 2002 he announced that the BOJ would buy some $24 billion in stock holdings from the country’s largest commercial banks.
Hayami’s announcement ignited a rally on the Nikkei 225 stock index, but the recovery was momentary. During his tenure as BOJ governor, which ended in 2003, the Nikkei ultimately lost nearly half its value, and deflation remained a problem. Nevertheless, Hayami maintained that there would be positive consequences of his policies in the long run. Indeed, by the time of his death in 2009, central banks across the globe had adopted his approach, and the BOJ once again had begun to purchase corporate shares to ease economic crisis.
