James Manning,   (born Oct. 22, 1738, Piscataway, N.J.—died  July 29, 1791, Providence, R.I., U.S.), U.S. Baptist clergyman who founded Rhode Island College (renamed Brown University in 1804) and served as its first president.
Manning, a graduate of Princeton in 1762, was ordained to the Baptist ministry the following year. Baptist authorities, intent on founding a college, put Manning, who had graduated second in his class, in charge of the project. A site was selected in Rhode Island, which was near the geographical centre of the colonies, and a charter was granted by the Rhode Island Assembly in March 1764. The next year the college opened in Warren, R.I., with Manning as its first president (1765–91). In 1770 it was moved to its present location in Providence, where Manning was also minister of the First Baptist Church. Although instruction was interrupted by the outbreak of the American Revolution, the college was firmly established by the end of Manning’s administration. He also helped form the Warren Association, a New England Baptist organization named for the church in which Manning served as pastor. Manning represented Rhode Island in the Congress of the Confederation in 1786, which governed the United States until the Constitution went into effect. In 1791 he drafted a report urging the establishment of free public schools.
