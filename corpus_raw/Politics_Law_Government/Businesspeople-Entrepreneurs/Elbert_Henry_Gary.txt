Elbert Henry Gary,  (born Oct. 8, 1846, near Wheaton, Ill., U.S.—died  Aug. 15, 1927, New York City), U.S. jurist and chief organizer of the United States Steel Corporation.
In 1871 Gary entered law practice in Chicago. He served as judge of Du Page County, Ill., from 1882 to 1890 and was president of the Chicago Bar Association from 1893 to 1894.
A leader and an authority in corporate law and the insurance business, Gary became general counsel and a director in a number of large railroads, banks, and industrial corporations. In 1898 he became the first president of the newly organized Federal Steel Company, which was backed by the financier J.P. Morgan. Federal Steel merged with the U.S. Steel Corporation in 1901. Gary was elected chairman of the board of directors and was the corporation’s chief executive officer during 26 years of remarkable development and growth of the steel industry.
As chairman of U.S. Steel, Gary helped improve the workers’ conditions by promoting stock ownership and profit sharing by the employees, higher wages, and safe, sanitary working conditions. He was a firm advocate of the open shop, however, and his unwillingness to negotiate that issue led to the steel strike of 1919–20. The strike forced him to give his support to abolishing the 7-day week and the 12-hour day in the steel mills. The town of Gary, Ind., named in his honour, was laid out in 1906 by U.S. Steel.
