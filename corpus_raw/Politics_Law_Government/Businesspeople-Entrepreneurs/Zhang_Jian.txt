Zhang Jian, Wade-Giles romanization Chang Chien,  (born July 1, 1853, Haimen, Jiangsu province, Chinaâ€”died August 24, 1926, Nantong, Jiangsu), a leading social reformer and industrial entrepreneur in early 20th-century China.
Zhang received a traditional Confucian education, and in 1894 he passed the top level of the civil service examination. The following year China was defeated in the Sino-Japanese War, and Zhang retired from office to develop industry in his native Jiangsu and make it an example of modernization for all of China. With government encouragement and tax benefits, he built the famous Dasheng (Dah Sun) Cotton Mill, which became the only private mill in China operating at a profit. He expanded this enterprise to include a flour mill, an oil mill, shipping lines, a distillery, and a machine shop. Concerned about the welfare of his workers, he built schools, roads, parks, orphanages, medical clinics, libraries, and a home for the aged.
After a short trip to Japan in 1903 he became an ardent advocate of constitutionalism and, in 1909, was elected president of the Provisional Assembly of Jiangsu. After the Chinese Revolution of 1911, he served as minister of agriculture and commerce in the new government.
