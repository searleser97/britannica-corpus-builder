Paul G. Hoffman, in full Paul Gray Hoffman,  (born April 26, 1891, Chicago—died  Oct. 8, 1974, New York City), American automobile-manufacturing executive who administered international assistance programs of the United States and the United Nations.
An employee of the Studebaker Corporation from 1911, he rose to become chairman of the board of directors in 1953 and chairman of the board of the company’s successor, the Studebaker–Packard Corporation, in 1954. From 1948 to 1950 Hoffman headed the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration, which, with the Organization for European Economic Cooperation, directed the post-World War II European Recovery Program (Marshall Plan). During 1951–53 he was president of the Ford Foundation. A U.S. delegate to the UN General Assembly in 1956–57, he became managing director of the Special United Nations Fund for Economic Development in 1959. In 1966 the fund was incorporated into the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), of which Hoffman was named administrator; he held that post till 1972. During his tenure Hoffman argued that the UNDP should be far more ambitious in sponsoring aggressive development programs. Subsequent debates led to major UN reforms, such as the establishment of indicative planning figures (IPFs, or funds a country could expect to receive over a five-year time frame) to assist with long-term development planning. Hoffman was a director of Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc., and of Encyclopædia Britannica Educational Corporation.
