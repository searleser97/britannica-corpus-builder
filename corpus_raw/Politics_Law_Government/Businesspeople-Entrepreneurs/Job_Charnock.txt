Job Charnock,  (died January 10, 1693, Calcutta [now Kolkata], India), controversial administrator in the British East India Company who is credited with establishing a British trading post at what is today Kolkata.
Arriving in India in 1655/56, Charnock was stationed first at Cossimbazar, north of present-day Kolkata, and then at Patna, in Bihar, eventually becoming chief agent of the East India Company at Hugli, on the Hugli (Hooghly) River, in 1686. Threatened there by the Mughal viceroy in Bengal, in 1690 he moved his operations 27 miles (43 km) south to Sutanati, one of several local villages already inhabited by local merchants that would later become part of Calcutta (now Kolkata). The selection of Calcutta as the capital of British India was largely the result of his persistence. Frequently at odds with Indian leaders and his superiors, Charnock was at times accused of mismanagement, theft, brutality to Indian prisoners, and having questionable morals; he was once recommended for dismissal. He lived with an Indian widow, whom he had rescued from her husband’s funeral pyre, and fathered several of her children.
Although Charnock was traditionally recognized as the founder of Kolkata, in 2003 the high court there ruled that, because settlement on the site long predated Charnock’s arrival, his role in establishing the city was not sufficient for him to be recognized as such.
