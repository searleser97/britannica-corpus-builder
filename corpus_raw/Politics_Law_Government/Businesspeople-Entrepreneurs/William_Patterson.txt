William Patterson, in full William Allan Patterson,  (born October 1, 1899, Honolulu, Hawaii—died June 13, 1980, Glenview, Illinois, U.S.), American airline executive who played a major role in shaping the history of aviation as the pioneering first president of United Airlines (1934–63), which became the world’s largest commercial air carrier.
In 1929 Patterson persuaded Philip G. Johnson (president of the Boeing Airplane Co. and Boeing Air Transport) and W.E. Boeing (chairman of the Boeing companies and the United Aircraft and Transport Corp.) to purchase Pacific Air Transport. Pacific and Boeing merged to form United Airlines, with Patterson as general manager and later as president. United flights eventually spanned the nation from coast to coast and were the first to carry female flight attendants and have pilots who were guaranteed a monthly salary regardless of their hours in the air. Patterson was also instrumental in helping the Douglas Aircraft Co. develop the DC-4, the first airliner equipped solely for passengers. After retiring as president in 1963, Patterson was elected chairman of the board. He held the position until 1966, when he was named director emeritus and honorary chairman of both United Airlines and its parent company, UAL Inc.
