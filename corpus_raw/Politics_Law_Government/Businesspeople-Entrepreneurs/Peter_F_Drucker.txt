Peter F. Drucker, in full Peter Ferdinand Drucker,  (born November 19, 1909, Vienna, Austria—died November 11, 2005, Claremont, California, U.S.), Austrian-born American management consultant, educator, and author, whose writings contributed to the philosophical and practical foundations of the modern business corporation. He was also a leader in the development of management education, and he invented the concept known as management by objectives.
Drucker, who received a doctoral degree in international and public law at the University of Frankfurt (1931), worked as a journalist in Germany but fled to England when Adolf Hitler rose to power in 1933. He remained in England until 1937, when he moved to the United States to work as an adviser to British banks and as a foreign correspondent for several British newspapers; he became a U.S. citizen in 1943. Drucker later taught at New York University (1950–71) and at Claremont Graduate University (1971–2005).
Although Drucker was known to shun the term consultant, it was through consulting that he wielded the greatest influence, starting with his 1943 invitation to analyze the organizational structure of the General Motors Corporation. The resulting book, Concept of the Corporation, offered the first complete assessment of a large corporation as a social institution. Drucker later served as a consultant to a number of corporations, organizations, and governments.
Some observers divide Drucker’s numerous books and articles into four categories. His early works—such as The End of Economic Man (1939) and The New Society (1950)—discuss the nature of industrial society. A second line of books—including Concept of the Corporation (1946) and The Practice of Management (1954)—explains general ideas about modern business management. A third body of work—including America’s Next Twenty Years (1957) and Technology, Management and Society (1970)—offers speculation on the future impact of such developments as technological change. Finally, there are writings that address questions of practical corporate management, notably Managing in Turbulent Times (1980) and the essay collection The Changing World of the Executive (1982). He vitalized the concept of the entrepreneur with Innovation and Entrepreneurship (1985). Drucker also wrote two novels. In 1990 the Peter F. Drucker Foundation for Nonprofit Management (renamed the Leader to Leader Institute in 2003) was established in his honour.
