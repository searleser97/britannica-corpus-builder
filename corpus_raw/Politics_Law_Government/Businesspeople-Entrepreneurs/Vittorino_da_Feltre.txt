Vittorino da Feltre, original name Vittore dei Ramboldini,  (born 1378, Feltre [Italy]—died February 2, 1446, Mantua), Italian educator who is frequently considered the greatest humanist schoolmaster of the Renaissance.
After 20 years as a student and teacher at the University of Padua, Vittorino was asked, in 1423, to become tutor to the children of the Gonzaga family, the rulers of Mantua. He agreed to do so if he could set up a school away from the court and, hence, from political influence. In addition to his royal charges, about 70 other children enrolled in his school, La Giocosa (“The Pleasant House”). These included boys of other noble families and poor boys chosen for their ability.
The central features of the curriculum were the languages and literature of Rome and Greece. Other subjects included arithmetic, geometry, and music, as well as games and physical exercises, for the school followed the Greek ideal of development of the body as well as the mind. Vittorino saw education, however, as a pathway to the Christian life. His pupils pictured him as a successful teacher who loved them, cared for their health and character, and adapted his methods to their abilities. Further, he used no corporal punishment. La Giocosa was possibly Europe’s first boarding school for younger students.
Vittorino not only educated future Italian rulers and professional men but also taught many Latin and Greek scholars who came to him from the East—thus fostering the translation of the Greek manuscripts that served to inspire the Renaissance.
