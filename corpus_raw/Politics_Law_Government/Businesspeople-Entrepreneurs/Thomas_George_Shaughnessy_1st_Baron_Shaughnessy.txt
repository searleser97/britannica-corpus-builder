Thomas George Shaughnessy, 1st Baron Shaughnessy,  (born October 6, 1853, Milwaukee—died December 10, 1923, Montreal), Canadian railway magnate.
Born the son of Irish immigrants, he began railway service at the age of 16 out of Milwaukee and in 1882 joined the staff of the Canadian Pacific Railway as general purchasing agent. In 1891 he was appointed its vice president, and from 1899 to 1923 he was either president or chairman and also director of all the allied lines. His tenure corresponded with the greatest expansion in the railroad’s history, with shipping and other industries being added to the company’s enterprises. He was knighted in 1901 and created a baron in 1916.
