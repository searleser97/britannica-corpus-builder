Pierre Chouteau, Jr.,  (born Jan. 19, 1789, St. Louis [U.S.]—died  Sept. 6, 1865, St. Louis, Mo.), American western entrepreneur who started in the Indian trade and died a multimillionaire.
Chouteau’s father, born Jean Pierre Chouteau, was a half brother of Auguste Chouteau, being the son of Marie Thérèse (Bourgeois) Chouteau and Pierre Laclède Liguest. Pierre junior worked briefly in his father’s store, but by the second decade of the 19th century he was in business for himself, trading with the Indians in the upper Mississippi and Missouri valleys.
In 1831 Chouteau joined the firm that acted as the western agent for the American Fur Company of John Jacob Astor. Three years later Chouteau bought out Astor’s interest, and in 1838 the firm of Pierre Chouteau, Jr., & Company enjoyed almost complete control over the Indian trade in the area.
But his business interests extended well beyond the Indian trade. In the 1830s he launched the first steamboat on the upper Missouri, and he later was an owner of an Illinois railroad. To augment his interests in trade and transportation, he was also associated with an iron-mining company in Missouri.
Chouteau’s business acumen was matched by his generosity. He exerted himself to help the Indians, western travelers, scientific expeditions, and many others. A fort and a city (Pierre, capital of South Dakota) were named after him.
