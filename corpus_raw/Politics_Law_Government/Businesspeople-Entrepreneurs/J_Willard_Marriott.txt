J. Willard Marriott,  (born Sept. 17, 1900, Marriott, Utah, U.S.—died  Aug. 13, 1985, Wolfeboro, N.H.), American businessman who founded one of the largest hotel and restaurant organizations in the United States.
The son of a Mormon rancher, Marriott worked his way through Weber College in Ogden and the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, graduating in 1926. He opened a small root beer and barbecue stand in Washington, D.C., in 1927 and by 1932 had expanded his Hot Shoppe chain of inexpensive family restaurants to seven in the area. By the end of World War II his restaurant chain had spread over the entire East Coast, and Marriott had started an airline catering service as well. In 1957 Marriott opened his company’s first motel, and during the 1950s and ’60s Marriott-Hot Shoppes, Inc., as the company was then called, became known as the fastest growing and most profitable organization in the American food and lodging business.
Marriott’s son J. Willard Marriott, Jr., succeeded his father as president of the renamed Marriott Corporation in 1964 and became the corporation’s chief executive officer in 1972; his father remained chairman of the board until his death. By the time of the elder Marriott’s death in 1985, the Marriott Corporation had 140,000 employees in 26 countries, operated 1,400 restaurants and 143 hotels and resorts in 95 cities, and had total annual sales of $3,500,000,000. Although the company’s stock was offered to the public in 1952, the Marriott family retained a controlling share of it.
Marriott, Sr., was an active supporter of Republican Party presidential candidates. He was awarded (posthumously) the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1988.
