William Cooper Procter,  (born August 25, 1862, Glendale, near Cincinnati, Ohio, U.S.—died May 2, 1934, Cincinnati), American manufacturer who established the nation’s first profit-sharing plan for employees.
The soapmaking firm of Procter & Gamble was founded in Cincinnati by Procter’s grandfather William Procter, a candlemaker, who joined with James Gamble, an Irish soapmaker, in 1837. The company expanded steadily with the successful marketing of Ivory soap, introduced in 1879, and with other products subsequently introduced during the presidency (1890–1907) of his father, William Alexander Procter.
William Cooper Procter started to work at the company in 1883 and became general manager in 1890, after working in every department of the plant. He was president from 1907 until 1930, during which time sales rose from $20 million to over $200 million. From 1930 until his death four years later, he was chairman of the board. During his career with Procter & Gamble, the company built plants in five states, Canada, and England, operated its own cottonseed oil mills, and offered new product lines such as Crisco shortening and Camay and Oxydol soaps.
Under his management, the company pioneered in labour relations. At his suggestion, in 1887, Procter & Gamble was the first American company to give a half-holiday on Saturdays. That same year he originated a profit-sharing plan.
In 1920 Procter changed the company’s retailing practices so that he could guarantee his employees 48 weeks of work every calendar year, year-round. His other innovations included a disability pension plan, a life insurance plan, and employee representation on the board of directors.
Procter was head of the Cincinnati Red Cross chapter for 20 years. His philanthropic activities included giving large donations to the Cincinnati children’s hospital and to Princeton University.
