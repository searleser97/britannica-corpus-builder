Jean Ango,  (born c. 1480, Dieppe, France—died 1551, Dieppe), French shipowner who, succeeding to his father’s import-export business, eventually controlled, by himself or in association with others, a fleet of 70 ships.
By means of his extensive fleet of commerce vessels, Ango was able, during the reign of Francis I, to ensure representation for France in maritime exploration. In 1524 he equipped the Dauphine, in which Giovanni da Verrazzano explored the east coast of North America and discovered the site of the future New York City. Jean and Raoul Parmentier in 1529 reached the coast of Sumatra in two of Ango’s ships, the Pensée and the Sacre.
Ango also sponsored privateering. One of his captains, Jean Fleury, seized three ships carrying Aztec treasures from Mexico to Spain in 1523. Francis I, who generally upheld Ango, borrowed his ships for use against Spain and England. In 1530 Francis authorized Ango to raid Portuguese shipping to compensate for losses sustained at Portuguese hands. Alarmed, the Portuguese ambassador came to terms with Francis.
On the king’s death, Ango became a victim of rivals and was imprisoned for a time in 1549 on a charge of official misconduct.
