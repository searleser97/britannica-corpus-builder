Maggie Lena Draper Walker, née Maggie Lena Draper,  (born July 15, 1867, Richmond, Virginia, U.S.—died December 15, 1934, Richmond), American businesswoman, who played a major role in the organizational and commercial life of Richmond’s African American community in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
Maggie Draper was the daughter of a former slave. She graduated from the Armstrong Normal School (1883) and then taught at the Lancaster School until her marriage in 1886 to Armstead Walker, Jr. Thereafter Walker devoted much of her time to the Grand United Order of St. Luke, an African American fraternal and cooperative insurance society. Working her way up through various local and general offices, Walker became executive secretary-treasurer of the renamed Independent Order of St. Luke in 1899. At the time she took office, the order had some 3,400 members in 57 local chapters and was in debt.
Walker went to work with remarkable energy and showed considerable business acumen. In 1902 she founded the St. Luke Herald to carry news of the order to local chapters and to help in its educational work. This included information regarding the training of children in habits of thrift, industry, and hygiene. In 1903 she opened the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank, of which she was president. By 1924 the main office staff of the order had grown to 50 individuals who served a membership of more than 50,000 in 1,500 local chapters. From 1929 to 1930 the Penny Savings Bank absorbed all other banks in Richmond owned by African Americans and became the Consolidated Bank and Trust Company. Walker served thereafter as the bank’s chairman of the board. She also helped found the Richmond Council of Colored Women (1912). Serving as president, she helped raise large sums for the support of such institutions as Janie Porter Barrett’s Virginia Industrial School for Colored Girls. Walker’s house was designated a national historic landmark in 1975.
