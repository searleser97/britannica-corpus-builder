John Henry Patterson,  (born December 13, 1844, near Dayton, Ohio, U.S.—died May 7, 1922, near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania), American manufacturer who helped popularize the modern cash register by means of aggressive and innovative sales techniques.
Patterson began his career as a toll collector for the Miami & Erie Canal and then went into business selling coal with his brother. Convinced that petty pilfering by clerks was cheating him of profits, he bought three new machines called cash registers, invented in 1879 by a Dayton tavern owner, James Ritty. The store eventually showed a profit, and Patterson bought Ritty out and renamed the firm the National Cash Register Company, later to be known familiarly as NCR.
Because the cash register was new and not readily accepted by merchants, Patterson devised a number of mechanical improvements to make the machine easier to use and pioneered several marketing innovations to stimulate sales. He introduced the idea of exclusive territory for each of his salesmen, and he opened a school to train them, a first in marketing history. He also made extensive use of direct-mail advertising and paid generous commissions to his sales staff. To upgrade the quality of his product, he improved working conditions for his labourers at a time when such actions seemed almost unethical to his fellow manufacturers. When Patterson took over Ritty’s operation, he transformed the ugly slum factory into an attractive workplace and established an industrial welfare organization, with programs aimed at improving the health, education, and working conditions of the employees. In return for these benefits, however, he demanded absolute devotion and high productivity from his subordinates.
Patterson became nationally known when he spearheaded the relief work after a flood devastated Dayton in 1913 and raised $2 million to fund a flood control and prevention plan.
