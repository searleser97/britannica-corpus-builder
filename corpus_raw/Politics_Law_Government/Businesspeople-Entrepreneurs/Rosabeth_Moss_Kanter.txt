Rosabeth Moss Kanter,  (born March 15, 1943, Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.), American social scientist and writer whose interests centred on the dynamics of corporate culture, management approaches, and corporate change.
Kanter graduated from Bryn Mawr College with honours (1964), after which she studied sociology at the University of Michigan (M.A., 1965; Ph.D., 1967) and completed postdoctoral studies at Harvard University (1975–76). Kanter taught sociology at the University of Michigan (1967), Brandeis University (1967–73, 1974–77), and Yale University (1977–86). In 1986 she was appointed to an endowed chair at the Harvard Business School as professor of business administration; she had previously taught sociology at Harvard (1973–74).
Whereas her earliest books concern the organization of life in communes, Kanter became interested in the structure and management of corporations in a changing society. Men and Women of the Corporation (1977) documents a bureaucratic corporate model that is about to be replaced; the video A Tale of “O”: On Being Different (1979) reveals how corporate culture discriminates against those who do not fit its stereotypes and assumptions; and The Change Masters: Innovation and Entrepreneurship in the American Corporation (1984) investigates the factors that promote corporate growth in contrast to those that suppress initiative. When Giants Learn to Dance: Mastering the Challenge of Strategy, Management, and Careers (1989) resulted from a five-year study of top American corporations; it documents the changing management strategies that, in Kanter’s view, represent the future of successful businesses in the United States.
Her other books included Work and Family in the USA: Critical Review and Research and Policy Agenda (1977), World Class: Thriving Locally in the Global Economy (1995), Rosabeth Moss Kanter on the Frontiers of Management (1997), Move: Putting America’s Infrastructure Back in the Lead (2015), and Think Outside the Building: How Advanced Leaders Can Change the World One Smart Innovation at a Time (2020). She also contributed to many texts on sociology, gender roles, and organizational development and was editor of the Harvard Business Review (1989–92).
