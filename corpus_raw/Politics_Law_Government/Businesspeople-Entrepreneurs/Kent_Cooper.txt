Kent Cooper,  (born March 22, 1880, Columbus, Indiana, U.S.—died January 31, 1965, West Palm Beach, Florida), American journalist who achieved prominence as executive director of the Associated Press (AP).
Cooper’s father was a successful Democratic politician. As a youth Cooper had an after-school reporting job at the local newspaper. After he spent two years at Indiana University, the death of his father forced him to go to work, and he became a reporter on the Indianapolis Press. His newspaper career took him to the Scripps-McRae Press Association, a precursor to the United Press, and then into his own agency, where he developed innovations that took him back to Scripps-McRae and soon brought him to the attention of Melville Stone, editor of the AP. He was hired as traveling inspector in 1910 and became chief of the traffic department in 1912. In 1920 Cooper was made assistant general manager. In subsequent years he helped make the AP a leader among the world’s news agencies, in part by encouraging writers to use livelier prose and features. Innovations adopted during his period of service included the first high-speed telegraph printing machines for the transmission of news and the first system of transmitting news photographs by wire, which he conceived. The latter, established in 1935, became Wide World Photos, Inc.
Cooper was a longtime and vigorous advocate of international freedom of the press and may have been the first journalist to introduce the phrase “the right to know” into the public lexicon. He was the author of Barriers Down (1942), Anna Zenger, Mother of Freedom (1946), The Right to Know (1956), and Kent Cooper and the Associated Press (1959).
