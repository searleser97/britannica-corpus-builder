Sir Reginald Myles Ansett,  (born February 13, 1909, Inglewood, Victoria, Australia—died December 23, 1981, Mount Eliza, Victoria), Australian pilot and businessman who started his own airline and subsidiary services.
Ansett was educated at Swinburne Technical College (now Swinburne University), Victoria, and, starting with one £A50 car, built up a taxi fleet in western Victoria. He also learned to fly airplanes, and, when local transport regulations prevented him from extending his taxi business to Melbourne, he bought a small monoplane that could carry up to six passengers. Ansett founded Ansett Airways Ltd. (later Ansett Transport Industries Ltd.) in 1936 and built it into one of the major airlines in Australia. Ansett’s air transport business expanded rapidly, and by 1957 he was able to purchase Australian National Airways for over £A3 million. His other business interests included hotels, television, and road transport. Ansett was knighted in 1969. In 1979 his company was taken over by media mogul Rupert Murdoch.
