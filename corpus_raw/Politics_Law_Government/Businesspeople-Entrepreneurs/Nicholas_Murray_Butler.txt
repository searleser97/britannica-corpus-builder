Nicholas Murray Butler,   (born April 2, 1862, Elizabeth, N.J., U.S.—died  Dec. 7, 1947, New York, N.Y.), American educator, publicist, and political figure who (with Jane Addams) shared the Nobel Prize for Peace in 1931 and served as president of Columbia University from 1901 to 1945.
Butler was educated at Columbia College, which became his intellectual and occupational home for the rest of his life. There, under the influence of Frederick Barnard (president of the college), he decided to prepare for a professional career in education. After completing his undergraduate work in 1882, Butler continued at Columbia as a graduate fellow in philosophy, taking his doctorate in 1884. A year in Paris and Berlin completed his formal education.
Butler was appointed an assistant in philosophy at Columbia in 1885, becoming professor of philosophy and education in 1890 and president of the university in 1901. He held the latter post until his retirement in 1945. Under his leadership Columbia grew from a provincial college into a university of world renown.
As a young man Butler strongly criticized the pedagogical methods of his time. As founder and president of the Industrial Education Association (1886–91), he played a central role in the establishment of the New York College for the Training of Teachers (renamed Teachers College, Columbia University in 1892). In later years Butler criticized pedagogical reform, steadfastly defending the “great tradition” of humanism in education and lashing out against such contemporary trends as vocationalism in education and behaviourism in psychology as the “new barbarism.”
Butler was a champion of international understanding, helping to establish the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, of which he was a trustee and later president (1925–45). He was active in the councils of the Republican Party for more than half a century, attending many national conventions. He was also president of the American Academy of Arts and Letters (1928–41).
