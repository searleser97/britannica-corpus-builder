Alfred Whitney Griswold,  (born Oct. 27, 1906, Morristown, N.J., U.S.—died  April 19, 1963, New Haven, Conn.), president of Yale University from 1950 to 1963 who greatly enhanced the school’s endowment and expanded its educational facilities.
Educated at private schools and at Yale (B.A., 1929; Ph.D., 1933), Griswold taught English at Yale for a year and then changed his academic concentration to history, which he taught at Yale from 1933, becoming assistant professor in 1938, associate professor in 1942, and full professor of history in 1947.
He founded the Yale Political Union (1934) to spur student interest in and debate about world events. During World War II he headed special U.S. Army training programs in languages and civil affairs. After the war Griswold’s efforts to bring Yale alumni into more active association with the university led to the creation (1948) of the Yale University Council, an advisory alumni organization.
In July 1950 Griswold became Yale’s 16th president and presided over the trebling of Yale’s endowment to $375,000,000, the construction of 26 new buildings, with greatly expanded facilities for engineering and the sciences, and the creation of two undergraduate residential colleges. His approach to faculty recruitment and retention more than doubled faculty salaries during his tenure. Griswold was an ardent believer in the liberal arts as opposed to a vocationally oriented curriculum. He was deeply committed to teacher training, and in 1952 Yale established a new master of arts program in teaching, affiliated with the traditional liberal arts departments.
Griswold wrote a number of influential books on foreign policy and on education, including The Far Eastern Policy of the United States (1938), Farming and Democracy (1948), Essays on Education (1954), In the University Tradition (1957), and Liberal Education and the Democratic Ideal (1959).
