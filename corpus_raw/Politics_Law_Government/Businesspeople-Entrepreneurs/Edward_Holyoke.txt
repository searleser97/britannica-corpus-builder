Edward Holyoke,  (born June 25, 1689, Boston—died  Jan. 1, 1769, Cambridge, Mass.), 10th president of Harvard College, who liberalized and strengthened its academic program.
Born into a distinguished Massachusetts family, Holyoke attended the most prestigious schools in Boston before entering Harvard, from which he was graduated with high honours in 1705. He stayed at the college for seven years, first in the dual capacity of tutor and librarian and then as a fellow of the Harvard Corporation. Holyoke then embarked upon theological studies and was ordained as pastor of the Marblehead (Mass.) Congregational Church (1716–37). In 1737 Holyoke was appointed president of Harvard.
Holyoke proved to be a popular president. He liberalized the curriculum and granted aid to deserving students. Harvard College prospered during his long administration (1737–69), despite the loss of its library in a disastrous fire. Though not considered a commanding intellect by his contemporaries, Holyoke strengthened Harvard’s academic program in mathematics and science, and during his tenure Harvard established the first laboratory for experimental physics in North America.
