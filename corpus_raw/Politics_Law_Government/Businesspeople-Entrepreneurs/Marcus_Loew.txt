Marcus Loew,  (born May 7, 1870, New York City—died  Sept. 5, 1927, New York City), American motion-picture executive and pioneer motion-picture theatre owner whose consolidation and expansion of his business interests helped establish Hollywood as the centre of the film industry.
Loew was the son of an Austrian immigrant and left school at the age of nine to help support his family, later finding modest prosperity in the fur business. Attracted by the new popularity of moving pictures, Loew owned a chain of nickelodeons by 1905, and thereafter he acquired many leading theatres for combined vaudeville and motion-picture exhibition. In 1920 Loew’s, Inc., purchased a production company named Metro Pictures Corporation; and in 1924 the Goldwyn Pictures Corporation, from which Samuel Goldwyn had resigned, was absorbed. The following year the name became Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), Inc., after Louis B. Mayer Pictures joined the group. Loew amassed an enormous fortune, and after his death MGM became the largest producer of motion pictures in the world.
