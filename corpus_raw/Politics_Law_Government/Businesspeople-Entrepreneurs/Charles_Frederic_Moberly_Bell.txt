Charles Frederic Moberly Bell,  (born April 2, 1847, Alexandria, Egypt—died April 5, 1911, London, England), British journalist who played a significant part in the management of The Times (London) during a troubled period.
Educated privately in England, Bell returned to Alexandria in 1865 to work for a commercial firm but soon established an informal connection with The Times; in 1875 he became its official correspondent. In 1880 he helped to found the Egyptian Gazette.
It was after a visit to Egypt by A.F. Walter, chief proprietor of The Times, that Bell was invited, in 1890, to assist in the paper’s management. The Times was then at a low ebb following its erroneous reporting about the Irish nationalist Charles Parnell. Although Bell was somewhat out of touch with technical developments, his strong will, courage, and industry enabled him to keep the paper alive. He reorganized the foreign department, writing personally to correspondents abroad, formed a publications department, and founded The Times Literary Supplement (1902) and The Times Educational Supplement (1910). He was associated with H.E. Hooper in the sale of the reprintings of the 9th (1898) and 10th (1902–03) editions of the Encyclopædia Britannica. He was also an enthusiastic supporter of Hooper in the formation of the Times Book Club in 1905. In 1908, despite much opposition, he brought about the sale of The Times to Lord Northcliffe, becoming managing director of the newly formed publishing company. Bell held that position for just three years. A tireless force until the end, he died at his editorial desk in 1911.
