Adolph Zukor,  (born Jan. 7, 1873, Ricse, Hung.—died  June 10, 1976, Los Angeles, Calif., U.S.), American entrepreneur who built the powerful Famous Players–Paramount motion-picture studio.
Immigrating to the United States at age 15, Zukor entered the penny-arcade business in 1903. Between 1904 and 1912 he and his partner Marcus Loew controlled a chain of theatres; in 1912 he left Loew, bought the American rights to the British-French motion picture La Reine Elisabeth (Queen Elizabeth, or Queen Beth) starring Sarah Bernhardt, and made a fortune as the film’s exclusive distributor. Zukor then devised the idea of making films featuring Broadway stage actors in their current successes. He formed Famous Players with the slogan “Famous Players in Famous Plays” and made The Count of Monte Cristo and The Prisoner of Zenda. He later hired Mary Pickford to act in motion pictures in Hollywood.
In 1916 Zukor merged Famous Players with Jesse L. Lasky’s Feature Play Company; Zukor became president and, in 1917, head of Paramount, which was Famous Players–Lasky’s distribution company. In 1935 he became chairman of the board of Paramount Pictures, a figurehead position but one he retained (emeritus) until his death at the age of 103.
Zukor was one of the first to recognize the potential of the star system and to pay his screen actors large salaries. The other key to his success was the huge number of movie theatres he controlled, which showed the films produced by the studio. His autobiography is The Public Is Never Wrong (1953).
