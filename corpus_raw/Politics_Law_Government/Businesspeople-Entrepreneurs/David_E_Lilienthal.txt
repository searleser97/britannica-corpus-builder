David E. Lilienthal, in full David Eli Lilienthal,  (born July 8, 1899, Morton, Ill., U.S.—died  Jan. 15, 1981, New York, N.Y.), American businessman and government official, who was codirector (1933) and first chairman (1941) of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and first chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC).
After graduation from DePauw University (Greencastle, Ind.) and Harvard Law School (1923), Lilienthal practiced law, engaging especially in cases of labour and public utilities. His winning a telephone-rate case that resulted in a refund of $20,000,000 to Chicago subscribers brought him to the attention of the governor of Wisconsin, who made him a member of the Wisconsin Public Service Commission in 1931. In this capacity he reorganized the utilities statutes for that state in such a way that they became a model for six other states.
Such accomplishments drew the attention of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and when the TVA flood-control project was approved by Congress, Roosevelt named Lilienthal one of the three codirectors of the TVA’s power program in 1933. In 1941 Lilienthal was appointed chairman of the project.
By becoming the first chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission in 1947, Lilienthal assumed power over the U.S. nuclear-development program, which had previously been supervised by the U.S. Army. As chairman, he was committed to improving and expanding nuclear-power plants, to building up a stockpile of atomic bombs, and to developing nuclear weapons.
Lilienthal resigned from the AEC in 1950 and in 1953 became chairman and chief executive officer of Development and Research Corp., where he continued formulating a resource development program that included dams, irrigation, electric power, and flood control. His books included Big Business, a New Era (1953), Change, Hope and the Bomb (1963), and Atomic Energy, a New Start (1980).
