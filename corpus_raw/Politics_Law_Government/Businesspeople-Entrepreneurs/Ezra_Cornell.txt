Ezra Cornell,   (born Jan. 11, 1807, Westchester Landing, N.Y., U.S.â€”died  Dec. 9, 1874, Ithaca, N.Y.), businessman, a founder of the Western Union Telegraph Company, and a guiding force in the establishment of Cornell University. Settling at Ithaca (1828), he became associated with Samuel F.B. Morse (1842) and superintended the construction of the first telegraph line in America, opened between Baltimore and Washington, D.C. (1844). In establishing telegraph lines throughout the U.S. he accumulated a substantial fortune and, for a time, was the largest stockholder of Western Union (organized 1855).
Settled on a farm near Ithaca, Cornell became interested in agricultural development. Following passage of the Morrill Act (1862), which provided federal support for agricultural colleges, he led in the founding at Ithaca of Cornell University, opened in 1868. His endowment to the new institution, eventually in excess of $3 million, helped place it in the front rank of U.S. universities. He also established the Ithaca Public Library (1864) and built railway lines facilitating access to the town.
