John Robert Russell, 13th duke of Bedford,  (born May 24, 1917—died October 25, 2002, Sante Fe, New Mexico, U.S.), elder son of the 12th duke (Hastings William Sackville Russell), succeeding to the title in 1953.
Faced with paying heavy death duties on his father’s estate, including Woburn Abbey, the 13th duke developed to the full the commercial possibilities inherent in opening a “stately home” to the public. He added to the show of magnificent collections of furniture and art treasures a number of popular attractions on the grounds, including a safari park that was initially administered by a famous circus family, the Chipperfields; the park became home to such animals as elephants, giraffes, rhinoceroses, and lions. The estate, situated on 3,000 acres (1,214 hectares), also featured a unique collection of some 10 species of deer. The 13th duke showed himself to be a resourceful publicist, and both he and Woburn Abbey became well known to the British public and to foreign tourists. By the early 21st century, Woburn Abbey was attracting some 1.5 million visitors annually. He wrote A Silver-Plated Spoon (1959), Book of Snobs (with George Mikes; 1965), The Flying Duchess (1968), and How To Run a Stately Home (with George Mikes; 1971).
