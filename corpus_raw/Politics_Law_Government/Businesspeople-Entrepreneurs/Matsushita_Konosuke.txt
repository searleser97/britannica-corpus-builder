Matsushita Konosuke,  (born Nov. 27, 1894, Wakayama prefecture, Japan—died  April 27, 1989, Ōsaka), Japanese industrialist who founded the Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd., the largest manufacturer of consumer electric appliances in the world.
His parents having died, Matsushita began work at age 9 as an errand boy. At age 16 he began working for the Ōsaka Electric Light Company, and he quit his job as an inspector there at age 23 to start a company that would sell electric plug attachments of his own design. His inventive marketing strategies helped the Matsushita Electric grow, and in 1935 he reorganized the company under the name it still holds. Matsushita managed to prevent his company from being broken up by the U.S. occupation authorities after World War II, and by the 1950s the Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. was the chief manufacturer of washing machines, refrigerators, and television sets for Japanese homes. In the decades that followed, the company became internationally famous for such products as electrical equipment, computer chips, and videocassette recorders under such brand names as Panasonic, Quasar, and National.
Matsushita was president of the company until 1961, at which time he became chairman of the board of directors. His influential business philosophy, which called for the production of essential consumer goods in abundance at the lowest possible prices, was widely adopted in the egalitarian, consumer-oriented society that emerged in Japan in the second half of the 20th century.
