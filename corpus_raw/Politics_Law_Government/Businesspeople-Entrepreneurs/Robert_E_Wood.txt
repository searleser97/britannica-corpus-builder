Robert E. Wood,  (born June 13, 1879, Kansas City, Mo., U.S.—died  Nov. 6, 1969, Lake Forest, Ill.), U.S. business executive under whose leadership Sears, Roebuck and Co. grew to become the world’s largest merchandising company.
Wood, a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy in 1900, was sent in 1905 to the Panama Canal Zone and worked with Gen. George W. Goethals, then in charge of constructing the canal. After completion of the canal late in 1914, Wood resigned his army commission and entered private business in 1915. During World War I, he returned to the service as a lieutenant colonel with the Rainbow Division in France. In April 1918 he returned to the U.S., was promoted to brigadier general, and served briefly as acting quartermaster general. Leaving the army again in 1919 to enter private industry, Wood worked for five years with Montgomery Ward & Company. He then moved to Sears, Roebuck and Co., where he became president in 1928, chairman of the board in 1939, and continued as a director of the company after his retirement in 1954. Active in public affairs, Wood supported Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal policies in the early 1930s but denounced them toward the end of the decade as “disastrous.” During the period immediately preceding entry of the U.S. into World War II, he headed the America First Committee, whose purpose was to keep the nation out of war. In December 1941 Wood left Sears temporarily to serve as a civilian adviser to the army. The company continued to grow, and in December 1967 Sears became the first retailer to record a single month’s sales of more than $1,000,000,000.
