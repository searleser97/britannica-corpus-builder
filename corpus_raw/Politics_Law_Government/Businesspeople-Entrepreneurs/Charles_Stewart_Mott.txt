Charles Stewart Mott,  (born June 2, 1875, Newark, N.J., U.S.—died  Feb. 18, 1973, Flint, Mich.), American automotive industrialist and philanthropist.
In 1900, when Mott started managing the Weston-Mott Co., his family’s bicycle-tire manufacturing firm in Utica, N.Y., he expanded the business by manufacturing wheels for automobiles as well as bicycles. As president of the company from 1903 to 1913, Mott moved the company to Flint in 1906 to be close to the production centre of the growing automobile industry.
When General Motors was formed in 1908, Mott acquired a great quantity of their stock in exchange for 49 percent of his Weston-Mott holdings. In 1913, when Weston-Mott had become the world’s leading supplier of automobile axles, Mott traded in the remaining 51 percent of his Weston-Mott stock for General Motors stock. (By 1942 he was the corporation’s largest stockholder.) Mott was active in General Motors leadership as a corporation director from 1913 until his death and was also a vice president from 1916 to 1937.
Mott was mayor of Flint three times between 1912 and 1918. In 1926 he created the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation. His subsequent gifts of cash and stock made his foundation one of the largest in the country, with $300 million in assets by the time of his death. The foundation funded a wide range of social and educational services for Flint, among other projects.
