Ellsworth Milton Statler,  (born Oct. 26, 1863, Somerset County, Pa., U.S.—died  April 16, 1928, New York City), U.S. hotel owner, founder of the Statler chain.
Statler grew up in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, and in Bridgeport, Ohio. Through most of his childhood he had to work because of his family’s poverty, and at 13 he got a job as a bellboy in a hotel in Wheeling, W.Va. He advanced to hotel clerk and studied hotel management and bookkeeping. Within a few years he was running his own lunch room and billiard hall in Wheeling. In 1896 he moved to Buffalo, N.Y., and took over the restaurant concession at the Ellicott Square Building. Two years later, when Buffalo was designated as the site of the Pan-American Exposition to be held in 1901, Statler built his first hotel, a temporary building of 2,100 rooms, near the exposition grounds. The reputation he earned from this venture won him the task of building the Inside Inn at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis in 1904. The same year he built the Statler Hotel in Buffalo, and his holdings were soon expanded into a chain of hotels in Detroit, Cleveland, St. Louis, and New York City.
The slogan of his hotel business was “The customer is always right,” and he took pains to provide for comfort and convenience in his hotels. The Statler Hotel in Buffalo was the first in the country in which each room had running water and a private bath. By the mid-1920s the Statler hotel properties were the largest in the nation owned by a single individual. In 1927 he opened his last hotel, in Boston. He died the following year.
