Sanofi-Aventis,  French pharmaceutical company founded in 2004 through the merger of Sanofi-Synthélabo SA and a much larger French firm, Aventis. Primarily focused on the development and sale of prescription medications, Sanofi-Aventis is one of Europe’s largest pharmaceutical firms.
Sanofi originated in 1973 as a subsidiary of French petrochemical firm Elf Aquitaine (acquired by Total in 2000). Synthélabo, another pharmaceutical firm, was founded in 1970. In 1973 French cosmetics firm L’Oréal purchased a majority ownership in Synthélabo and continued to develop the company’s global market for prescription drugs. International competition and consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry, however, led to the merger that created Sanofi-Synthélabo SA in 1999. Soon after the merger, Sanofi’s profitable cosmetics business (which included luxury brands such as Yves Saint Laurent) was sold. This left Sanofi-Synthélabo solidly focused on pharmaceutical research, development, and marketing. Elf Aquitaine and L’Oréal retained significant stakes in the new firm.
In 2004 a proposed bid for Aventis by Swiss firm Novartis AG prompted Sanofi-Synthélabo to acquire its larger domestic rival. The French government had expressed an interest in keeping a pharmaceutical industry leader within France, and the creation of Sanofi-Aventis was seen as a means toward that end. Following lengthy negotiations, Sanofi-Aventis announced in 2011 that it was purchasing the U.S. biotechnology company Genzyme for about $20 billion.
