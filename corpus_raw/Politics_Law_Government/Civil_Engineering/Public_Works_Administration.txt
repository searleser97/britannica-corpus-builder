Public Works Administration (PWA),  in U.S. history, New Deal government agency (1933–39) designed to reduce unemployment and increase purchasing power through the construction of highways and public buildings. Authorized by the National Industrial Recovery Act (June 1933), the Public Works Administration (PWA) was set up by Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt under the administration of his secretary of the interior, Harold L. Ickes. During its existence, the PWA spent about $4 billion in the construction of more than 70 percent of the nation’s new educational buildings; 65 percent of its new courthouses, city halls, and sewage-disposal plants; 35 percent of its new public health facilities; and 10 percent of all new roads, bridges, and subways. As the country moved into a war economy, beginning in 1939, the PWA was gradually liquidated.
