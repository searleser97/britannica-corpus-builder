Victor Riqueti, marquis de Mirabeau,  (born Oct. 5, 1715, Pertuis, Fr.—died  July 13, 1789, Argenteuil), French political economist, the forerunner and later patron of the Physiocratic school of economic thought. He was the father of the renowned French revolutionary the Comte de Mirabeau.
After serving as an officer in the War of the Polish Succession (1733–38) and the War of the Austrian Succession (1740–48), Mirabeau left the army to devote himself to the study of political economy. In his first major work, Mémoire concernant l’utilité des états provinciaux . . . (1750; “Memorandum Concerning the Usefulness of the Provincial Estates . . .”), he criticized the highly centralized governmental system that had been set up by King Louis XIV and proposed that the provincial assemblies, which then existed in only a small part of France, be established throughout the kingdom. In his popular Ami des hommes, ou Traité de la population (1756–58; “The Friend of Man, or Treatise on Population”), Mirabeau borrowed heavily from the ideas of Richard Cantillon, an earlier 18th-century British writer, in stressing the primacy of agriculture over commerce as a source of wealth. Mirabeau’s approach to economics had anticipated the doctrines that were being formulated by the Physiocratic school of François Quesnay, and the Marquis soon associated himself with the Physiocrats’ attempts to reform France’s antiquated, inefficient system of taxation. In his Théorie de l’impôt (1760; “Theory of Taxation”) he attacked the tax farmers (financiers who purchased from the crown the right to collect indirect taxes) and proposed that they be replaced with a system of direct taxes on land and on personal income. Although the tax farmers pressured the government into exiling Mirabeau to his estates at Bignon, he continued to devote his efforts to the advancement of Physiocracy.
