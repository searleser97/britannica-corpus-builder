German Salaried Employees’ Union, German Deutsche Angestellten-Gewerkschaft (DAG),  white-collar labour organization in Germany. The DAG was organized in 1945, shortly after the end of World War II, and became established throughout West Germany; after 1990, workers joined from the former East Germany. The original belief was that white-collar workers should have a single organization separate from blue-collar workers. Several unsuccessful attempts were made, however, to integrate the DAG with the German Trade Union Federation, Germany’s largest labour federation. In the 1990s the DAG had about 580,000 members.
