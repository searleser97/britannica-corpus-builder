Oskar Ryszard Lange,  (born July 27, 1904, Tomaszów Mazowiecki (near Lódz), Poland—died October 2, 1965, London, England), Polish-born economist who taught in the United States and Poland and was active in Polish politics. Lange’s belief that a state-run economy could be as efficient as (or more efficient than) a market economy prompted his return to Poland after World War II, where he worked for the country’s Stalinist government in an attempt to prove his views.
Lange studied law and economics in Poznań and Kraków, writing his Ph.D. thesis (1928) on the topic of Polish business cycles. In 1934 a Rockefeller fellowship funded further studies in England and the United States. His experiences made him fluent in both Marxist and Western economics, especially as they were expressed in American universities. After publishing On the Economic Theory of Socialism (1938), he taught statistics and economics at the University of Chicago (1938–45). In the aftermath of World War II, he was appointed Poland’s ambassador to the United States (1945–46) and became Poland’s delegate to the United Nations Security Council (1946–47).
He devoted much of his later work to reconciling Marxist economics with neoclassical (supply-oriented) pricing theories, insisting throughout that state-controlled industries would do a better job of setting prices. “There is not the slightest reason why trial and error procedure, similar to that in a competitive market, could not work in a socialist economy to determine the accounting prices of capital goods and of the productive resources in public ownership,” he wrote. Although his reputation in the West was undermined by his association with Joseph Stalin (Lange lauded him as an economic theorist), Lange’s assertions about centrally planned economies remained influential past his death, though they were ultimately rejected with the fall of Polish communism in 1989.
