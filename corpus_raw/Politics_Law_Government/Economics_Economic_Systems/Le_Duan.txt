Le Duan, also called Le Dung,  (born April 7, 1908, Quang Tri province [now Binh Tri Thien province], Vietnam—died  July 10, 1986, Hanoi), Vietnamese communist politician.
Le Duan was a founding member of the Indochina Communist Party in 1930. Twice imprisoned by the French, he joined the Viet Minh, Ho Chi Minh’s anti-French communist-led front, and attained an influential position on the Central Committee of Ho’s new Republic of Vietnam in Hanoi in 1945. After Vietnam’s division in 1954, Le Duan was put in charge of establishing an underground Communist Party organization in South Vietnam. He thus oversaw the creation in 1962 of the People’s Revolutionary Party, a crucial component of the National Liberation Front.
Upon Ho’s death in 1969, Le Duan, as first secretary to the Vietnam Worker’s Party, assumed party leadership—a position that he retained after the party’s reorganization as the Vietnamese Communist Party in 1976. At that time, his official title became secretary-general. After the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, Le Duan led the party through a difficult period that witnessed the formal reunification of Vietnam, the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia, and the country’s break with China and the expulsion of much of its ethnic Chinese community. Vietnam under Le Duan entered into a close alliance with the Soviet Union and became a member of Comecon (Council for Mutual Economic Assistance).
Though adept at party organizing and at mobilizing human resources in pursuit of victory during the Vietnam War, Le Duan proved less pragmatic afterward as a maker of peacetime economic and foreign policy.
