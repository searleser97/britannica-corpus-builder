Whitley Council, also called Joint Industrial Council,  in Great Britain, any of the bodies made up of representatives of labour and management for the promotion of better industrial relations. An original series of councils, named for J.H. Whitley, chairman of the investigatory committee (1916â€“19) who recommended their formation, were first instituted as a means of remedying industrial unrest. Many of them later developed into wage negotiating bodies.
The Whitley Council principle was extended and applied to nonindustrial sectors as well. Thus in 1919 a National Whitley Council was formed for the entire nonindustrial civil service in Britain.
