Liberal Front Party (PFL), Portuguese Partido da Frente Liberal,  centre-right Brazilian political party that supports free-market policies.
Founded in 1984, the Liberal Front Party (PFL) was established ostensibly to oppose the presidential candidacy of Paulo Maluf in Brazil’s 1985 elections—the first civilian democratic elections since 1964. The new party subsequently joined the Democratic Alliance (Aliança Democrática; AD) in support of the candidacy of Tancredo de Almeida Neves. José Sarney, a cofounder of the PFL, was selected as Neves’s vice presidential candidate. The Neves-Sarney ticket won the balloting, but when Neves fell ill and died before taking office, Sarney became president; he served in the post until 1990. In 1987 the PFL withdrew from the AD, and in 1988 Sarney left the party in an unsuccessful attempt to form a winning coalition for the 1989 presidential election.
The PFL later became one of the most important groups that supported the presidential candidacy of Brazilian Social Democratic Party (Partido da Social Democracia Brasileira; PSDB) cofounder Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who won election handily in both 1994 and 1998. The party has had particular success in national legislative elections. In 1992, for example, it was the largest pro-government group in the Chamber of Deputies, the legislature’s lower house, and in 1998 it emerged as the chamber’s largest party. With support particularly concentrated in the poorer Amazon regions, in the northeast, and in small and medium-sized towns, the PFL is well represented at the state and municipal level. During Cardoso’s second term, relations between the PFL and the PSDB increasingly grew tense, and in 2001 the alliance of the two parties formally ended. In the elections of 2002, the PFL finished second, capturing one-sixth of the seats in the Chamber of Deputies.
