Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences,   independent nongovernmental organization headquartered in Stockholm and primarily composed of Swedish members. The main goal of the academy is to promote scientific research and defend the freedom of science.
The academy was founded in 1739; it based itself on the Royal Society of London and the Royal Academy of Sciences in Paris. Through relations with these other academies, the Royal Swedish Academy helps to maintain international contact and communication among scientific researchers. Other goals include keeping the Swedish public informed of accomplishments and discoveries in science and rewarding those who make scientific discoveries. One way in which the academy achieves the latter goal is by selecting the annual winners of the Nobel Prizes for Physics, Chemistry, and Economics. See also Nobel Prizes.
