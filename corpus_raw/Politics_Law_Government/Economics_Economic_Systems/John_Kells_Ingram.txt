John Kells Ingram,  (born July 7, 1823, Temple Carne, County Donegal, Ireland—died May 1, 1907, Dublin), Irish economic historian who also achieved fame as a scholar and poet.
Ingram graduated from Trinity College in Dublin in 1843. He showed considerable promise in both mathematics and classics and achieved early popularity as a poet. In 1852 he became a professor of oratory at Trinity College, and he wrote extensively on Shakespeare. He then became Regius Professor of Greek (1866–77), librarian (1879–87), and vice provost (1898–99).
In 1847 Ingram helped to found the Dublin Statistical Society. His early economic writings dealt mainly with the Poor Law, which in theory was to provide relief for the poor but in reality did little to alleviate the distress in Ireland. Strongly influenced by the French sociologist Auguste Comte, Ingram rejected the more isolated approach of classical economics (which builds on the assumption that people try to do the best they can) and instead sought to develop a unified theory of economics along the lines of Comtean positivist philosophy (which sought ways for economic policies to contribute to the good of society). His writings on this topic include the essay “Present Position and Prospects of Political Economy” (1878) and A History of Political Economy (1888).
