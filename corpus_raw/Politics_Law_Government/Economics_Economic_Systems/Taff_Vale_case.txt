Taff Vale case,   (1900–01), in Great Britain, the successful trial of a suit brought by the Taff Vale Railway Company against the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants (ASRS) in which the courts held that a union could be sued for damages caused by the actions of its officials in industrial disputes. Opposition to the decision did much to spur the growth of the nascent British Labour Party.
In August 1900, members of the ASRS went on strike for higher wages and union recognition but settled within a fortnight when the company employed strikebreakers; the workers gained virtually nothing but the company’s promise of reemployment. During the strike the company began legal action against the union, claiming that picketing was in violation of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act of 1875. The ASRS held that because it was neither a corporation nor an individual it could not be held liable. Justice Sir George Farwell decided against the union, and in 1901 his decision was upheld in the House of Lords. The verdict, in effect, eliminated the strike as a weapon of organized labour. Workers turned to the Labour Party for redress; between 1900 and 1906 the number of Labour members of Parliament rose from 2 to 29, and the Liberal government’s Trade Disputes Act of 1906 nullified the effect of the decision.
