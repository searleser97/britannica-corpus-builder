Anticonsumerism movement,  a social ideology that decries the excessive purchasing and consumption of material possessions. Anticonsumerism (and consumerism itself) focuses largely on the reasons goods are acquired—that is, on why and how certain commodities are bought and consumed by individuals. Much contemporary criticism of consumerism is concerned with social issues and problems seen as inextricably linked to consumerism’s growth and expansion. One primary concern of anticonsumerism is the purchase of consumer goods on the basis of novelty or because of artificially manufactured perceived needs. The movement holds that such consumerism produces or contributes to resource depletion and environmental degradation, consumer debt, competitive or conspicuous consumption, unequal distribution of wealth, and global poverty. Anticonsumerism has been encouraged by both religious and secular groups to curb the demand for a continual supply of novel products.
