Emil Steinbach,  (born June 11, 1846, Vienna, —died  May 26, 1907, Vienna), Austrian economist, jurist, and statesman noted for his social reforms while serving in the ministries of justice and finance under Eduard, Graf von Taaffe (1879–93).
Entering the Austrian Ministry of Justice in 1874, Steinbach rose quickly through the ranks of the legislative section and became departmental head in 1887. Between 1885 and 1891, he successfully developed legislation providing sickness and accident insurance for workers, and he elaborated programs that included industrial relations and the formation of workers’ councils. Appointed minister of finance in 1891, he reformed the system of personal taxation. His proposal for voting reform, a democratic measure designed to blunt the appeal of nationalism among non-German minorities, brought the downfall of the Taaffe ministry (October 1893). After 1904 Steinbach served as president of the Supreme Court of Justice.
