Postindustrial society,  society marked by a transition from a manufacturing-based economy to a service-based economy, a transition that is also connected with subsequent societal restructuring. Postindustrialization is the next evolutionary step from an industrialized society and is most evident in countries and regions that were among the first to experience the Industrial Revolution, such as the United States, western Europe, and Japan.
American sociologist Daniel Bell  first coined the term postindustrial in 1973 in his book The Coming of Post-Industrial Society: A Venture in Social Forecasting, which describes several features of a postindustrial society. Postindustrial societies are characterized by:
In addition to the  economic characteristics of a postindustrial society, changing values and norms reflect the changing influences on the society. Outsourcing of manufactured goods, for example, changes how members of a society see and treat foreigners or immigrants. Also, those individuals previously occupied in the manufacturing sector find themselves with no clearly defined social role.
There are a number of direct effects of postindustrialism on the community. For the first time, the term community is associated less with geographical proximity and more with scattered, but like-minded, individuals. Advances in telecommunications and the Internet mean that telecommuting becomes more common, placing people farther away from their place of work and their coworkers.
The relationship between manufacturing and services changes in a postindustrial society. Moving to a service-based economy means that manufacturing must occur elsewhere and is often outsourced (that is, sent away from a company to a contracted supplier) to industrial economies. While this gives the illusion that the postindustrial society is merely service-based, it is still highly connected with those industrial economies to which the manufacturing is outsourced.
