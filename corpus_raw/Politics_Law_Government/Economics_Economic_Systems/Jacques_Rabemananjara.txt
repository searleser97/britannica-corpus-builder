Jacques Rabemananjara,  (born June 23, 1913, Tananarive, Madagascar—died April 1, 2005, Paris, France), Malagasy politician, playwright, and poet.
Rabemananjara began writing in the early 1940s and published his first volume of verse, Sur les marches du soir (“On the Edges of Evening”), in 1942. A death sentence imposed on him for his alleged participation in the 1947 revolt in Madagascar embittered him, despite a later reprieve, and the poems of Antidote, written while he was imprisoned in 1947–50 and published in 1961, reflect his anger at the injustice imposed on him and his political hopes for the future.
By the mid-1960s, when he was Madagascar’s minister of economic affairs, Rabemananjara had published five volumes of verse and several plays, many of them glorifying the history and culture of his country. In his writing he defended and proclaimed the values of African culture, particularly its closeness to nature, contact with ancestral tradition, and ancient rhythm of life. His plays, Les Dieux malgaches (1947; “The Malagasy Gods”), Les Boutriers de l’aurore (1957; untranslatable), and Les Agapes des dieux: Tritivatragédie malgache (1962; “Love Feasts of the Gods”), and his somewhat rhetorical poems were well received, and he became one of Madagascar’s most prominent writers.
Rabemananjara was also an influential politician. He held several government posts, including minister of foreign affairs, and in the late 1960s he was considered a possible presidential candidate. His popularity subsequently waned, however, in part because of allegations of corruption, and in 1972 he moved to Paris. In 1992 Rabemananjara ran for president of Madagascar, but he was easily defeated.
