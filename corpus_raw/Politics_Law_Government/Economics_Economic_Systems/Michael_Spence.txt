A. Michael Spence,  (born 1943, Montclair, New Jersey, U.S.), American economist who, with George A. Akerlof and Joseph E. Stiglitz, won the Nobel Prize for Economics in 2001 for laying the foundations for the theory of markets with asymmetric information.
Spence studied at Yale University (B.A., 1966), the University of Oxford (B.A., M.A., 1968), and Harvard University (Ph.D., 1972). He taught at Harvard and at Stanford University, serving as dean of the latter’s business school from 1990 to 1999. In 2010 he became a professor at New York University’s Leonard N. Stern School of Business.
Through his research on markets with asymmetric information, Spence developed the theory of “signaling” to show how better-informed individuals in the market communicate their information to the less-well-informed to avoid the problems associated with adverse selection. In his 1973 seminal paper “Job Market Signaling,” Spence demonstrated how a college degree signals a job seeker’s intelligence and ability to a prospective employer. Other examples of signaling included corporations giving large dividends to demonstrate profitability and manufacturers issuing guarantees to convey the high quality of a product.
