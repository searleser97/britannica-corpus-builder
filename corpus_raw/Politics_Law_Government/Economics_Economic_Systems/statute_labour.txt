Statute labour,   unpaid work on public projects that is required by law. Under the Roman Empire, certain classes of the population owed personal services to the state or to private proprietors—for example, labour in lieu of taxes for the upkeep of roads, bridges, and dikes; unpaid labour by coloni (tenant farmers) and freedmen on the estates of landed proprietors; and labour requisitioned for the maintenance of the postal systems of various regions. The feudal system of corvée—regular work that vassals owed their lord—developed from this Roman tradition. (The term corvée, meaning contribution, is now often used synonymously with statute labour.)
Similar labour obligations have existed in other parts of the world. In Japan the yō system of imposing compulsory labour on the farmers was incorporated in the tax system in the 7th century. The Egyptians used the corvée for centuries to obtain labour to remove the mud left at the bottom of the canals by the rising of the Nile River. In various times and places the corvée has been used when money payment did not provide sufficient labour for public projects. In wartime the corvée was sometimes used to augment regular troops in auxiliary capacities.
The corvée differs from forced labour in being a general and periodic short-term obligation; forced labour is usually prescribed for a long or indefinite period as a method of punishment or of discrimination.
