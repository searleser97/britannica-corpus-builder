Thane, also spelled Thegn,  in English history before the Norman Conquest (1066), a free retainer or lord, corresponding in its various grades to the post-Conquest baron and knight. The word is extant only once in the laws before the time of King Aethelstan (d. 939).
The thane became a member of a territorial nobility, and the dignity of thanehood was attainable by those who fulfilled certain conditions. In like manner a successful thane might hope to become an earl. There were others who were thanes because of their birth, and thus thanehood was partly inherited and partly acquired. The thane was inferior to members of a kingly family, but he was superior to the ceorl.
The increase in the number of thanes produced in time a subdivision of the order. There arose a class of king’s thanes, corresponding to the earlier thanes, and a larger class of inferior thanes, some of them the thanes of bishops or of other thanes. A king’s thane was a person of great importance, the contemporary idea being shown by the Latin translation of the word as comes (the Latin for what became “count”). He had certain special privileges. No one but the king had the right of jurisdiction over him.
The 12 senior thanes of the hundred (a territorial division) played some part in the development of the English system of justice. By a law of Ethelred II they seem to have acted as the judicial committee of the court for the purposes of accusation, and thus they have some connection with the grand jury of modern times.
The word thane was used in Scotland until the 15th century to describe a hereditary nonmilitary tenant of the crown.
