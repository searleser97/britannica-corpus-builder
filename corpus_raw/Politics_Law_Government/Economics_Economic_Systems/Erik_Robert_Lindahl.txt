Erik Robert Lindahl,  (born November 21, 1891, Stockholm, Sweden—died January 6, 1960, Uppsala), Swedish economist who was one of the members of the Stockholm school of economics that developed during the late 1920s and early ’30s from the macroeconomic theory of Knut Wicksell.
Lindahl held positions at the Universities of Lund, Gothenburg, and Uppsala (1942–60). His main work in English is Studies in the Theory of Money and Capital (1939). One of his most important achievements was the development of the sequence analysis in economics, which influenced Gunnar Myrdal’s concepts of saving and investment.
Lindahl, along with Swedish economists Myrdal and Bertil Ohlin, furthered Wicksell’s monetary theory by applying it to conditions other than full employment. Lindahl also developed the benefit principle in taxation, described in his book Die Gerechtigkeit der Besteuerung (1919; “The Justness of Taxation”). That principle holds that each person’s share of taxes paid for government-provided goods and services should equal the share of benefits each person receives. Lindahl argued that not only would such a payment scale be just and fair, but it would also lead to the optimum levels of government provision.
In elaborating this principle, Lindahl built on an idea originally set forth by Wicksell. He also advanced Wicksell’s development of the Austrian economic school’s theory of capital. He was interested in the development of economic accounting systems that would have general validity, and he made statistical studies of income and prices.
