Tozama daimyo,   (Japanese: “outside daimyo”), nonhereditary feudal lord or daimyo in Japan during the Tokugawa period (1603–1867), whose house had been equal to the Tokugawa house before the establishment of the shogunate (hereditary military dictatorship). Despite their lack of hereditary ties to the shogunate, these houses, because of their importance and status, were allowed to retain their domains.
As potential rivals, the tozama daimyo were excluded from participation in the government, and many of their estates were reduced in size. Their numbers declined from 119 in 1602 to 97 by the mid-19th century, when some of them began to acquire Western armaments to use against the shogunate. The Tokugawa attempted to counter this movement by opening their government to participation from some of the tozama houses, but it was too late. In 1868 discontented daimyo, led by men from the two large anti-Tokugawa fiefs of Satsuma and Chōshū, overthrew the regime and established the new centralized Imperial state under the emperor Meiji (see Meiji Restoration).
