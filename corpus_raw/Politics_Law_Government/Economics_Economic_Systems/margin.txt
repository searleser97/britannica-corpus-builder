Margin,   in finance, the amount by which the value of collateral provided as security for a loan exceeds the amount of the loan. This excess represents the borrower’s equity contribution in a transaction that is partly financed by borrowed funds; thus it provides a “margin” of safety to the lender over and above the collateral that is pledged. The size of the margin that is required varies with the type of collateral, the stability of its market price, expectations with regard to its future price, and the credit standing of the borrower.
The term margin is used especially in connection with transactions in securities and commodity futures. When securities are purchased “on margin,” the buyer supplies only a percentage, or margin, of the purchase price and borrows the remainder from his broker, pledging the security as collateral for the loan. A fall in the price of the security subsequent to the purchase reduces the margin available to the lender, and the customer may be called upon to restore his margin to a prearranged level. This level is determined by the lending broker but may not be below minimum levels stipulated by the organized exchange in which the transaction takes place.
Minimum initial margin requirements on loans made for the purpose of purchasing securities are required in the United States by the Federal Reserve Board, under authority granted by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The purpose of the margin requirement is to prevent excessive use of credit for speculation in stocks. Dealings on margin are not allowed on British stock exchanges.
