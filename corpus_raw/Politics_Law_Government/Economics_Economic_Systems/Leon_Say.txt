Léon Say,  (born June 6, 1826, Paris, Fr.—died  April 22, 1896, Paris), economist who served as finance minister in the Third Republic of France.
Say was born into a prominent Protestant family and was the grandson of another well-known economist, Jean-Baptiste Say. Early in his career, Say worked for the Journal des Débats, later becoming its editor. He became known for his opposition to the Second Empire in general and the policies of Baron Haussmann in particular. He refused to support the monarchy in 1875 and voted instead for a constitutional republic. In addition to his terms as deputy (1871–76, 1889–96) and senator (1876–89), Say served as finance minister in the cabinets of seven administrations (1872–73, 1875–76, 1876–79, and 1882). During his first term as finance minister he demonstrated his financial genius by paying off the massive debt that France had incurred in the course of the Franco-German War (1870–71). In his later terms as finance minister, Say voiced his disapproval of the constant state of indebtedness of the Third Republic and tried to maintain free trade.
Along with his ministerial duties, Say was ambassador to London in 1880 and served as president of the Senate (1880–82). His politics in the legislature became increasingly antisocialist, but, after 1883, Say finally recognized the need for government to support public works. He wrote extensively on economics, his works including the classic Les finances de la France sous la troisième République (1898–1901), and directed publication of Nouveau dictionnaire d’économie politique (1891–92).
