Silent trade, also called dumb barter, or depot trade,  specialized form of barter in which goods are exchanged without any direct contact between the traders. Generally, one group goes to a customary spot, deposits the goods to be traded, and withdraws, sometimes giving a signal such as a call or a gong stroke. Another group then comes to leave a second set of articles and retreats. The first group returns, removing these new goods if satisfied or leaving them until additions are made. The second group then takes the original wares to conclude the transaction.
The classical description of silent trade comes from the works of Herodotus, who mentioned the exchanges of goods between the Carthaginians and peoples of the west coast of Africa. This widespread institution has also been reported from Siberia, Lapland, west Africa, Timor, Sumatra, India, Sri Lanka, and New Guinea. Silent trade is often a response to difficulties in communication due to language barriers or to inequality of cultural advancement between neighbouring peoples.
