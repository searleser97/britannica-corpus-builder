Nikolay D. Kondratyev, in full Nikolay Dmitriyevich Kondratyev,  (born March 4, 1892—died  1938?), Russian economist and statistician noted among Western economists for his analysis and theory of major (50-year) business cycles—the so-called Kondratieff waves.
Kondratyev attended St. Petersburg University. He was a member of the Russian Socialist Revolutionary Party from 1917 to 1919. From 1920 to 1928 he taught at the Timiriazev Agricultural Academy and was director of the Institute for the Study of Business Activity. He established contact with foreign economic agencies, and in 1924 he lectured in the United States and Great Britain. During this period he helped to develop the first of the Soviet five-year plans, as well as devising methodology for the analysis of economic factors that would stimulate Soviet economic growth. Although he had approved of the New Economic Policy (1921–28), he opposed the total collectivization of agriculture and criticized the disproportionate development of industry and agriculture in Joseph Stalin’s plan, which was eventually adopted. In 1928 he was dismissed from his post in the institute. Two years later he was arrested on charges of leading the Working Peasants’ Party, and in 1931 he was tried and sentenced to eight years in prison. In 1938 his sentence was reviewed, and he received the death penalty. The date and place of his death are unknown. In 1987, together with many others tried on false accusations, Kondratyev was cleared of all charges against him.
