Le Duc Tho, original name Phan Dinh Khai,  (born October 14, 1911, Nam Ha province, Vietnam—died October 13, 1990, Hanoi), Vietnamese politician who, acting as an adviser to North Vietnam, negotiated a cease-fire agreement with U.S. official Henry Kissinger during the Vietnam War. The two men were jointly awarded the 1973 Nobel Prize for Peace, but Tho declined it.
Le Duc Tho was one of the founders of the Indochinese Communist Party in 1930. For his political activities, he was imprisoned by the French in 1930–36 and 1939–44. After his second release he returned to Hanoi in 1945 and helped lead the Viet Minh, the Vietnamese independence organization, as well as a revived communist party called the Vietnam Workers’ Party. He was the senior Viet Minh official in southern Vietnam until the Geneva Accords of 1954. From 1955 he was a member of the Politburo of the Vietnam Workers’ Party, or the Communist Party of Vietnam, as it was renamed in 1976. During the Vietnam War (1955–75) Tho oversaw the Viet Cong insurgency that began against the South Vietnamese government in the late 1950s. He carried out most of his duties during the war while in hiding in South Vietnam.
Tho is best known for his part in the cease-fire of 1973, when he served as special adviser to the North Vietnamese delegation to the Paris Peace Conferences in 1968–73. He eventually became his delegation’s principal spokesman, in which capacity he negotiated with Kissinger, the U.S. national security adviser, the cease-fire agreement that led to the withdrawal of the last American troops from South Vietnam. It was for this accomplishment that he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Tho oversaw the North Vietnamese offensive that overthrew the South Vietnamese government in 1975, and he played a similar role in the first stages of Vietnam’s invasion of Cambodia in 1978. He remained a member of the Politburo until 1986.
