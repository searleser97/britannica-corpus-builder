Camilla Ravera,  (born June 18, 1889, Acqui Terme, Italy—died April 14, 1988, Rome), Italian politician and leading figure in the Italian Communist Party (PCI).
Ravera taught school in Turin (1908–09), and in 1918 she joined the Italian Socialist Party (PSI). She gravitated toward the left wing of the PSI under the leadership of Antonio Gramsci, wrote a column for Gramsci’s newspaper, L’Ordine Nuovo, and edited the journal La Compagna. Ravera remained loyal to Gramsci when his leftist faction split from the PSI (1921) and formed the PCI. She served on the PCI Central Committee (1922–30) and coordinated clandestine activities after the fascist government of Benito Mussolini outlawed the party and arrested Gramsci in 1926. Ravera was arrested in 1930 and sentenced by a special tribunal to 15 years in jail. She was imprisoned for five years and then remained in internal exile until 1943. Ravera was expelled from the PCI in 1943 because of her opposition to the 1939 German-Soviet nonaggression pact, but her party membership was reinstated in 1945. As a member of the Chamber of Deputies (lower house) from 1948 and later as the first woman elected to the Senate (upper house), she was a powerful advocate of women’s rights. In 1983 Ravera was appointed senator for life by Pres. Alessandro Pertini.
