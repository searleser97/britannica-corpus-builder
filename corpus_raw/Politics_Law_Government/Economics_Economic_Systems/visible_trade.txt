Visible trade,   in economics, exchange of physically tangible goods between countries, involving the export, import, and re-export of goods at various stages of production. It is distinguished from invisible trade, which involves the export and import of physically intangible items such as services.
Countries lacking various raw materials will import needed substances such as coal or crude oil from nations able to export such materials. Sometimes raw materials will be partially processed or converted into producer goods within the country from which they originate. Goods may also be processed into consumer goods prior to export or import and prior to the ultimate purchase by the buyer. These consumer goods may be durable (consumed over a period of time), as are appliances or automobiles, or nondurable (consumed almost immediately), as is food. Visible trade also includes the export and import of goods used directly in the production of other goods and services (capital goods) such as industrial machinery and equipment.
The relationship of visible trade exports to imports is reflected in a country’s balance of trade or visible balance. A surplus in the balance of trade occurs when exports exceed imports and a deficit occurs when imports are greater than exports. The balance of trade is the major component of a country’s balance of payments, which includes debits and credits resulting from invisible trade.
