Sylvia Field Porter, née Sylvia Field Feldman,  (born June 18, 1913, Patchogue, Long Island, N.Y., U.S.—died June 5, 1991, Pound Ridge, N.Y.),  American economist and journalist whose financial advice—in newspaper columns, books, and magazines—garnered a wide audience in a field dominated by men.
Porter graduated from Hunter College in New York City in 1932. She worked as an assistant in a Wall Street investment house, and while learning firsthand the intricacies of the market in government bonds she took supplementary courses at the School of Business Administration of New York University. During 1934–35 she published Reporting on Governments, a pioneer weekly newsletter on the government bond market. In 1935 she began contributing a thrice-weekly financial column to the New York Post, and within a short time she was the paper’s regular financial reporter.
Porter’s column became a daily feature in 1938 under the title “Financial Post Marks” and was later syndicated to more than 400 newspapers across the country. To avoid the possibility of prejudice against a woman in the traditionally male field of finance, she signed the column S.F. Porter for many years; later it was titled “S.F. Porter Says” and still later simply “Sylvia Porter.” Her column did not stop at financial reporting and investment tips; many of her investigations of practices in commodities and securities markets prompted reforms. She received a number of awards for her writing.
In 1978 Porter moved her column to the New York Daily News, where it remained until 1991. She also wrote for several magazines, notably the Ladies’ Home Journal, of which she was also a contributing editor. Her books include How to Make Money in Government Bonds (1939), If War Comes to the American Home (1941), Managing Your Money (1953; with J.K. Lasser), Sylvia Porter’s Money Book (1975), Planning Your Retirement (1991), and from 1961 the annual Sylvia Porter’s Income Tax Guide. In 1984 she launched Sylvia Porter’s Personal Finance Magazine, which quickly grew to be the third largest periodical in its field, but she sold it in 1989.
