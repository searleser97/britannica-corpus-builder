Hendricus Sneevliet, in full Hendricus Josephus Franciscus Marie Sneevliet,  (born May 13, 1883, Rotterdam, Neth.—died April 13, 1942, Amersfoort), Dutch communist politician who founded the Indies Social Democratic Association in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) and whose oratory stimulated the nationalist movement there.
Sneevliet began working for the Dutch railroads and by 1909 was president of the Union of Rail and Tram Employees. He also was involved with the Social Democratic Workers Party. After a disagreement with other union leaders, he went to the East Indies (1912), where he wrote for the Soerabajaasch Handelsblad (“Surabaya Trade Journal”) and served as secretary to a trade company in Semarang, then the centre of radicalism in the East Indies.
Sneevliet then devoted his life to the Indonesian nationalist movement. In 1914 he founded the Social Democratic Association, whose members were socialists of varying degrees of radicalism. After the party split in 1917, Sneevliet led its more revolutionary wing. His party gained a strong hold over the Semarang railway union, and its members worked their way into the Sarekat Islām (a powerful Muslim party with nationalist aims). An inflammatory orator, Sneevliet was deported from the East Indies in 1917 because of his revolutionary activities.
On returning to Europe, Sneevliet was employed by the Communist International. After 1924 he limited his activities to the Netherlands, where he founded the Revolutionary Socialist Party in 1929 and sat in Parliament as one of its representatives from 1933 to 1937. The Germans executed him in 1942.
