Expenditure tax,  tax levied on the total consumption expenditure of an individual. It may be a proportional or a progressive tax; its advantage is that it eliminates the supposed adverse effect of the personal income tax on investment and saving incentives. Difficult to administer, it has been applied with only limited success in India and Sri Lanka.
