Władysław Anders,  (born Aug. 11, 1892, Błonie, Pol., Russian Empire—died May 12, 1970, London, Eng.), commanding officer of the Polish army in the Middle East and Italy during World War II who became a leading figure among the anticommunist Poles who refused to return to their homeland after the war.
After service in the Russian army during World War I, Anders entered the armed forces of the newly reconstituted Polish state and fought the Red Army in the Russo-Polish War of 1919–20. Campaigning against both Germany and the Soviet Union at the outbreak of World War II (September 1939), he was captured by the Soviets and imprisoned until the Polish-Soviet agreement of August 1941. Allowed to form a Polish fighting force on Russian soil from former prisoners of war and deportees, Anders soon had 80,000 men, but he realized that he had no chance of liberating Poland from the East with an army under Soviet control. As a result of both Polish and British pressure, Joseph Stalin allowed Anders to march into Iran and Iraq (1942). The Poles subsequently distinguished themselves in the Italian campaign, capturing Monte Cassino. A staunch anticommunist, Anders remained in Great Britain after World War II; the new communist Polish government deprived him of his citizenship in 1946. Thereafter he became a prominent leader of Polish exiles in the West.
