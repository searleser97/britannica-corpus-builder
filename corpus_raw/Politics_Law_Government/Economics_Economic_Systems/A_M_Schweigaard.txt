A.M. Schweigaard, in full Anton Martin Schweigaard,  (born April 11, 1808, Kragerø, Nor.—died  Feb. 1, 1870, Christiania [now Oslo]), Norwegian jurist and economic reformer who helped bring about Norway’s change to a capitalist economy.
A professor of jurisprudence and economics in the 1830s and ’40s and an extremely influential publicist for economic liberalism, Schweigaard was elected to the Storting (parliament) in 1842, serving in that body until 1869. As a legislator and as a member of various parliamentary and governmental committees, he was a leader in Norway’s transition from a mercantilist-agricultural economy to one of free enterprise. Coordinating his activities with Frederik Stang, his kindred spirit in the government, Schweigaard helped to bring about such essential economic reforms as free trade, freedom of choice of occupation, and road and railway development. He was also a supporter of a modern, as opposed to a classical, educational curriculum and a zealous champion of the temperance movement. When he left Parliament in 1869, Norway was well on its way to a modernized economy.
