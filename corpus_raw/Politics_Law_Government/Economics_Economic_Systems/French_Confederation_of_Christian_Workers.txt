French Confederation of Christian Workers, French Confédération Française des Travailleurs Chrétiens (CFTC),  French labour-union federation that was founded in 1919 by Roman Catholic workers who opposed both the syndicalist and communist movements of the day. The confederation, based on Catholic social and anti-Marxist principles, rejected the theory of class warfare but occasionally collaborated on strikes with the leftist General Confederation of Labour (Confédération Générale du Travail, or CGT). The CFTC stressed efforts to raise wages and had its main strength among white-collar workers and textile workers. The CFTC was banned by the Vichy government during World War II. 
After the war, a growing body of reformers within the revived CFTC sought to weaken its ties to the Roman Catholic church. These reformers eventually achieved a majority within the CFTC, and in 1964 a special congress, in a secularizing action, modified the union’s constitution and changed its name to French Democratic Confederation of Labour (Confédération Française Démocratique du Travail, or CFDT). A minority opposed to these changes left the renamed CFDT and began their own labour confederation, retaining both the CFTC’s name and its Social Christian orientation. This renewed CFTC remained considerably smaller than the CFDT and the CGT.
