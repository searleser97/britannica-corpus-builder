Silver standard,  monetary standard under which the basic unit of currency is defined as a stated quantity of silver and which is usually characterized by the coinage and circulation of silver, unrestricted convertibility of other money into silver, and the free import and export of silver for the settlement of international obligations.
No country presently operates under a silver standard. During the 1870s most European countries adopted the gold standard, and by the early 1900s only China and Mexico and a few small countries still used the silver standard. In 1873 the U.S. Treasury stopped coining silver. This led to the Free Silver Movement, whose supporters (miners, farmers, and debtors) advocated the return of silver coin. After the defeat of William Jennings Bryan, who ran for U.S. president on a platform advocating free and unlimited coinage of silver in 1896, agitation for free silver died in the United States. The U.S. Congress adopted the gold standard in 1900.
