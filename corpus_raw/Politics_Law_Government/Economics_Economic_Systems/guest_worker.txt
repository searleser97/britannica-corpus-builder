Guest worker,  foreign national who is permitted to live and work temporarily in a host country. Most guest workers perform manual labour.
The term guest worker is most commonly associated with its German translation, Gastarbeiter, designating the mainly Turkish workers admitted to West Germany after World War II to help rebuild the countryâ€™s infrastructure. Many of the Gastarbeiter became permanent residents, and in the early 21st century they and their descendants constituted a large ethnic group within Germany. Sizable numbers of Gastarbeiter also came from Italy, Spain, Yugoslavia, Morocco, Portugal, and Tunisia. Most of the Gastarbeiter were men seeking to support their wives and children back home or to save enough to secure a comfortable life there. Many of them did not intend to stay in Germany for more than a few years.
Guest workers have also existed in sizable numbers outside Europe. For example, a large community of Korean guest workers existed in Japan from the early 1990s.
In the United States, guest-worker programs have been developed to match workers to specified gaps in the labour market; this has particularly been the case in the agricultural sector. The H-2A program, for example, enables employers to import agricultural workers, while H-1B visas have been issued to allow recruitment of skilled workers. Many migrant workers have continued to work illegally in the United States, in particular those who entered the country from Mexico. This has been a contentious issue for U.S. politicians, who in the early 2010s in particular faced pressure from those who sought to protect illegal workers by offering them guest-worker status and from those who wanted to protect employment opportunities for U.S. citizens, especially in the agricultural sector.
