Exit interview,  typically a survey given by an employer to a departing employee, though exit interviews can also involve people leaving other types of organizations or institutions, such as an educational facility. The purpose of exit interviews is to understand why talent is leaving, what might have prevented these people from leaving, and their attitudes toward the organization. In addition, an exit interview might cover information that will be helpful to an individualâ€™s replacement.
Most exit interviews are conducted by someone in human resources, and the departing employee is typically leaving the organization voluntarily. There are essentially three options for administering an exit survey: paper-and-pencil, Internet, or interviews, the latter of which can be in person or over the telephone. The questions address how the employee perceived his or her compensation, benefits, working conditions, opportunities for career advancement, workload, and manager quality as well as the relationships between coworkers and supervisors. The information can then be used to enhance recruiting, retention, and employee engagement efforts. However, a major drawback of exit interviews is false or misleading responses from employees.
