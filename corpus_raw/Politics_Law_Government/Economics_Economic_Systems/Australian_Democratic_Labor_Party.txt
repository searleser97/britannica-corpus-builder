Australian Democratic Labor Party,  (ADLP), right-wing political party in Australia founded in 1956–57 by Roman Catholic and other defectors from the Australian Labor Party. Militantly anticommunist, the ADLP supported Western and other anticommunist powers in Oceania and Southeast Asia and strongly backed Australia’s involvement in the Vietnam War. The party in effect supported the Liberal-Country coalition governments to keep its parent, the Australian Labor Party, out of power. Electorally it occasionally won a few seats in the Senate but never won seats in the House of Representatives. The decline of communism as an issue in the country and the improved vitality of the Australian Labor Party diminished the influence of the ADLP after 1970, and it disbanded in 1978.
