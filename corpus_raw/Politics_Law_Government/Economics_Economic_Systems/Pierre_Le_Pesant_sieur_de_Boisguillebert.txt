Pierre Le Pesant, sieur de Boisguillebert,  (born 1646, Rouen, France—died  1714, Rouen), French economist who was a precursor of the Physiocrats and an advocate of economic and fiscal reforms for France during the reign of Louis XIV.
Boisguillebert was opposed to the economic policy of Jean-Baptiste Colbert, finance minister to Louis XIV, who attempted to increase the manufacturing potential of France by keeping agricultural prices at a low level in the hope that low-wage goods would be an incentive to industry. Like his Physiocratic successors, Boisguillebert thought that national wealth was dependent on the prosperity of agriculture. He was an agricultural protectionist, but his belief in the natural order of economic and social relationships and his opposition to the medieval economic restrictions that had proliferated brought him close to a laissez-faire position. In fiscal reform he advocated direct rather than indirect taxes; reform of the taille, a direct tax from which the French kings derived the major part of their revenue; and a 10 percent income tax. For his views and his support of the disgraced Sébastien de Vauban, another advocate of reform, Boisguillebert was dishonoured and for a time exiled.
