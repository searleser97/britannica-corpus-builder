Thomas Fortune Ryan,  (born Oct. 17, 1851, Lovingston, Va., U.S.—died Nov. 23, 1928, New York, N.Y.), American financier who played a key role in numerous mergers and business reorganizations that took place about the turn of the 20th century, including those resulting in the creation of the Metropolitan Street Railway Company and the American Tobacco Company.
Born in poverty and orphaned at the age of 14, Ryan came to New York at 21, joining the New York Stock Exchange in 1874. Later, in company with such notable financial manipulators as William C. Whitney, he became involved in the consolidation of utility companies in New York and elsewhere. In 1892 he organized the Metropolitan Street Railway Co., a large traction syndicate in New York City whose securities-holding firm, the Metropolitan Traction Company, is considered to have been the first holding company in the United States. The syndicate ultimately merged with August Belmont’s Interborough Rapid Transit Company in 1905. Through a series of mergers, the American Tobacco Company, organized in the 1890s, enjoyed a virtual monopoly of the American tobacco market until the company was ordered dissolved by the federal government in 1911. Ryan also had interests in railroads, coke, coal, diamonds in the Belgian Congo, oil, rubber, and lead.
Shrouding his operations in secrecy most of his life, Ryan was little known to the public until 1905, when he purchased control of the floundering Equitable Life Assurance Co., arousing the protest of policyholders. Later he turned the firm over to trustees. In 1908 Ryan was accused of misdealings, but a grand-jury investigation failed to substantiate any charges. At the time of his death Ryan left a fortune of more than $200 million.
