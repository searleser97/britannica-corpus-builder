cafeteria,  self-service restaurant in which customers select various dishes from an open-counter display. The food is usually placed on a tray, paid for at a cashier’s station, and carried to a dining table by the customer. The modern cafeteria, designed to facilitate a smooth flow of patrons, is particularly well adapted to the needs of institutions—schools, hospitals, corporations—attempting to serve large numbers of people efficiently and inexpensively. In addition to providing quick service, the cafeteria requires fewer service personnel than most other commercial eating establishments.
Early versions of self-service restaurants began to appear in the late 19th century in the United States. In 1891 the Young Women’s Christian Association (YWCA) of Kansas City, Missouri, established what some food-industry historians consider the first cafeteria. This institution, founded to provide low-cost meals for working women, was patterned after a Chicago luncheon club for women where some aspects of self-service were already in practice. Cafeterias catering to the public opened in several U.S. cities in the 1890s, but cafeteria service did not become widespread until shortly after the turn of the century, when it became the accepted method of providing food for employees of factories and other large businesses.
