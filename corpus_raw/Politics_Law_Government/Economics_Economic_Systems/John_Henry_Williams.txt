John Henry Williams,  (born June 21, 1887, Wales—died  Dec. 24, 1980, Southbridge, Mass., U.S.), American economist, banker, and government adviser who achieved world renown as an expert on international trade.
Williams was educated at Brown University and Harvard, where he obtained his Ph.D. (1919). He was a professor of economics at Harvard (1921–57) and then became professor emeritus. For 10 years (1937–47) Williams served as the first dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Public Administration. He also taught at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy (1957–63). Outside of academia, Williams was economic adviser to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (1933–56) and vice president (1936–47). Throughout World War II and afterward, he was a top government adviser on economics.
Williams’ principal fame as an economist rests upon his writings in the field of international trade. A major early work was Argentine International Trade under Inconvertible Paper Money (1920), which successfully tested the classical theory of international transfer and takes its place alongside classic studies by Frank Taussig and Jacob Viner. He had earlier produced, with others, pioneering data on the historical development of the U.S. balance of payments. He contributed vigorously to the debates during and after World War II on the postwar monetary arrangements and is regarded as the inventor of the key-currency principle that stressed the pivotal role of the dollar in the international monetary system.
