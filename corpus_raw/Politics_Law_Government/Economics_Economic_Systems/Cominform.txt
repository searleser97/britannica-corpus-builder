Cominform, formally Communist Information Bureau, or Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers’ Parties, Russian Informatsionnoye Byuro Kommunisticheskikh i Rabochikh Party,  agency of international communism founded under Soviet auspices in 1947 and dissolved by Soviet initiative in 1956.
The Communist Information Bureau was founded at Wilcza Góra, Pol., in September 1947, with nine members—the communist parties of the U.S.S.R., Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Yugoslavia, France, and Italy. The most vehement supporters of the Cominform were the Yugoslav communists under the leadership of Tito; therefore, Belgrade was selected as the seat of the organization. Mounting tension, however, between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union led ultimately to the expulsion of Tito’s party from the Cominform in June 1948, and the seat of the bureau was moved to Bucharest, Rom.
The Cominform’s activities consisted mainly of publishing propaganda to encourage international communist solidarity. The French and Italian parties were ineffective in carrying out the chief task assigned to them by the Cominform—to obstruct the implementation of the Marshall Plan and the Truman Doctrine. Like the Third International (Comintern) in its later phases, the Cominform served more as a tool of Soviet policy than as an agent of international revolution.
On April 17, 1956, as part of a Soviet program of reconciliation with Yugoslavia, the Soviets disbanded the Cominform.
