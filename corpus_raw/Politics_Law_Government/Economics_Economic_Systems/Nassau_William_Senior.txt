Nassau William Senior,  (born September 26, 1790, Compton Beauchamp, Berkshire, England—died June 4, 1864, London), British classical economist who influenced the political and economic policies of his day.
Senior was educated at Eton and at the University of Oxford, from which he graduated in 1812. He qualified as a lawyer in 1819. It was as an economist, however, that Senior made his greatest contributions. He became one of the leading economic theorists of the first half of the 19th century and was the first Drummond Professor of Political Economy at Oxford (1825–30, 1847–52).
In An Outline of the Science of Political Economy (1836), he introduced the view—later attacked by Marxists—that savings and the accumulation of capital should be considered parts of the cost of production. He also worked on the concept of rent, advanced the abstinence theory of profits (which described a reward for abstaining from spending one’s accumulated capital), and led the revolt among the classical economists against the Malthusian theory of population. In his two lectures on population (1829), which were some of the first criticisms of Thomas Malthus, Senior argued that the combination of rising living standards and population growth offered strong evidence against Malthus’s pessimistic theory. He also contributed to theories on the distribution of precious metals and showed the relationship between productivity and price levels.
Actively involved in the setting of economic policy, Senior served as adviser to the Whig Party and wrote the New Poor Law of 1834. He was also one of the commissioners on handloom weavers (1841) and advised the government of Prime Minister William Melbourne to oppose trade unions.
