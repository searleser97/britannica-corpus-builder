Quota,   in international trade, government-imposed limit on the quantity, or in exceptional cases the value, of the goods or services that may be exported or imported over a specified period of time. Quotas are more effective in restricting trade than tariffs, particularly if domestic demand for a commodity is not sensitive to increases in price. Because the effects of quotas cannot be offset by depreciation of the foreign currency or by an export subsidy, quotas may be more disturbing to the international trade mechanism than tariffs. Applied selectively to various countries, quotas can also be a coercive economic weapon.
Tariff quotas may be distinguished from import quotas. A tariff quota permits the import of a certain quantity of a commodity duty-free or at a lower duty rate, while quantities exceeding the quota are subject to a higher duty rate. An import quota, on the other hand, restricts imports absolutely.
If the quantity imported under a quota is less than would be imported in the absence of a quota, the domestic price of the commodity in question may rise. Unless the government maintains some system of licensing importers in order to capture as revenue the difference between the higher domestic price and the foreign price, the importing of such commodities can prove a lucrative source of private profit.
Quantitative trade restrictions were first imposed on a large scale during and immediately after World War I. During the 1920s quotas were progressively abolished and replaced by tariffs. The next great wave of quota protection came during the Great Depression in the early 1930s, with France leading the European countries in introducing a comprehensive quota system in 1931. After World War II, the western European countries began a gradual dismantling of quantitative import restrictions, but the United States tended to make more use of them.
