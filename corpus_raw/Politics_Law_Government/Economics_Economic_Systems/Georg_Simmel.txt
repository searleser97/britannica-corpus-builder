Georg Simmel,  (born March 1, 1858, Berlin, Germany—died Sept. 26, 1918, Strassburg), German sociologist and Neo-Kantian philosopher whose fame rests chiefly on works concerning sociological methodology. He taught philosophy at the Universities of Berlin (1885–1914) and Strassburg (1914–18), and his insightful essays on personal and social interaction inspired the development of qualitative analysis in sociology.
Simmel sought to isolate the general or recurring forms of social interaction from the more specific kinds of activity, such as political, economic, and aesthetic. He gave special attention to the problem of authority and obedience. In Philosophie des Geldes (1900; 6th ed., 1958; The Philosophy of Money, 1978), he applied his general principles to a particular subject, economics, stressing the role of a money economy in specializing social activity and depersonalizing individual and social relationships. In the last decade of his life, he devoted himself to metaphysics and aesthetics.
Simmel’s sociology first became influential in the United States through translations and commentaries by Albion W. Small (1854–1926), one of the first important American sociologists. The Sociology of Georg Simmel (trans. and ed. by Kurt H. Wolff, 1950) comprises translations from Soziologie (1908) and other works.
