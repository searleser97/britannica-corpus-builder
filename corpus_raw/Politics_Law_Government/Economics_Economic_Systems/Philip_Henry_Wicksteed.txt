Philip Henry Wicksteed,  (born Oct. 25, 1844, Leeds, West Yorkshire, Eng.—died  March 18, 1927, Childrey, Berkshire), British economist, classicist, literary critic, and theologian.
Wicksteed, who was for some years a Unitarian minister, was a writer on literature, classics, theology, and philosophy, and his fame at the time of his death was greater in these contexts than as an economist. He wrote, among many works, Dante and Aquinas (1913) and Dogma and Philosophy (1920).
His membership in the Fabian Society turned his interest to economics, and among his writings in this field are The Alphabet of Economic Science (1888) and The Common Sense of Political Economy (2 vols., 1910). Influenced by William Jevons and the Austrian economists, Wicksteed wrote on the theory of economic choice and the allocation of scarce resources. His most famous contribution to distribution theory, presented in An Essay on the Co-ordination of the Laws of Distribution (1894), was the use of Euler’s Theorem to advance the view that distribution according to the principle of marginal productivity exhausted total product. It is believed that it was Wicksteed who turned George Bernard Shaw and the Fabians away from Marxism.
