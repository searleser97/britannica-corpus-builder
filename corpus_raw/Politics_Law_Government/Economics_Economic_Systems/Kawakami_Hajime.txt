Kawakami Hajime,  (born Oct. 20, 1879, Iwakuni, Japan—died Jan. 30, 1946, Tokyo), journalist, poet, and university professor who was one of Japan’s first Marxist theoreticians.
While working as a journalist after his graduation from Tokyo University in 1902, Kawakami translated from the English E.R.A. Seligman’s Economic Interpretation of History, the first analysis of dialectical materialism to appear in Japanese. In 1913 he went to Europe for further study. Upon his return in 1915 he became professor of economics at Kyōto Imperial University, where he remained until 1928, when his political activities forced his resignation. While in Kyōto he began publishing his own magazine, Shakai mondai kenkyū (“Studies on Social Problems”), which he used as a vehicle to educate students and workers in Marxist economics. His Keizagaku taikō (“Outline of Economics”), published in 1928, and his introduction to the Japanese edition of Karl Marx’s Das Kapital was crucial in the development of theoretical economics in Japan during the 1920s and ’30s.
During the 1920s Kawakami gradually became more directly involved in politics; he ran unsuccessfully for the national Diet (parliament) as a candidate of the Proletarian Party. He also engaged in the activities of the outlawed Japan Communist Party, his arrest for illegal political activities ending his active political involvement. Upon his release from jail in 1937, he began writing his Autobiography, which discusses the gradual evolution of his thought from the Tolstoyan nationalism he espoused as a youth to Marxism. During the winter of 1945–46, in the days after World War II, Kawakami, a broken old man, died of malnutrition. Four volumes of his poetry were published posthumously in 1946.
