GMB, formerly (1924–74) National Union of General and Municipal Workers (NUGMW),1974–82 General and Municipal Workers’ Union (GMWU), and (1982–89) General, Municipal, Boilermakers and Allied Trade Union (GMBATU),  one of the largest trade unions in Great Britain and one of the two giant general unions (the other being Unite). The National Union of General and Municipal Workers (NUGMW) was formed in 1924 by the merger of the National Union of Gas and General Workers, the National Amalgamated Union of Labour, and the Municipal Employees’ Association. The union’s membership originally comprised unskilled workers spread across a wide range of industries—particularly public utilities, local government, chemicals and rubber, engineering and shipbuilding, food processing, and drink manufacturing. Later in the 20th century the NUGMW—which eventually became known as the General and Municipal Workers’ Union—drew increasing numbers of skilled and white-collar workers. Thus, in 1982 it merged with the craft-based Amalgamated Society of Boilermakers to form the General, Municipal, Boilermakers and Allied Trade Union (GMBATU), which in 1989 merged with the white-collar Association of Professional, Executive, Clerical, and Computer Staff. Thereafter the union was known simply as GMB. Its membership amounted to some 700,000 in the early 21st century.
