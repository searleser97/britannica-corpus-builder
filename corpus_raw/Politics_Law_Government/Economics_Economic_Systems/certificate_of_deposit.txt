Certificate of deposit (CD),  a receipt from a bank acknowledging the deposit of a sum of money. Among the common types are demand certificates of deposit and time certificates of deposit. Demand certificates of deposit are payable on demand but do not draw interest; they are used primarily by contractors as evidence of good faith when submitting a bid or as a guaranty of performance, and they may also be used as collateral to secure a loan. Time certificates of deposit bear interest and are payable on or after a specific date. Interest on time deposits is higher than for regular savings accounts. Because of this, a depositor who withdraws money deposited on a time basis before the maturity date of the certificate is subject to loss of interest.
In the United States, treasury-rate certificates of deposit pay interest according to the discount rate for treasury bills at the time that the certificate of deposit was purchased, and the interest rate is guaranteed for the life of the certificate. Sterling certificates of deposit are subject to the controls of the Bank of England.
