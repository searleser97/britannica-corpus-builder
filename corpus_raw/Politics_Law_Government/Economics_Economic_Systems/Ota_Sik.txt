Ota Šik,  (born Sept. 11, 1919, Plzeň, Czech. [now Czech Republic]—died Aug. 22, 2004, Sankt Gallen, Switz.), Czech economist who laid the economic groundwork for the reforms of the Prague Spring of 1968.
Šik studied art in Prague before World War II. After Germany invaded Czechoslovakia in 1939, he was involved with the resistance. In 1940 he was arrested and subsequently sent to the Mauthausen concentration camp. After the war, Šik studied politics and social sciences in Prague before joining the Czechoslovak Academy of Science as head of its economics institute.
In April 1968 he was named vice-premier and economics minister under Alexander Dubček. By proposing a “third way” between free-market capitalism and a Soviet-style planned economy, Šik sought to bring “socialism with a human face” to the Czechoslovak government. Vehemently opposed to such liberalizing reforms, the Soviet Union sent Warsaw Pact troops to occupy Czechoslovakia in August 1968. Šik was vacationing in Yugoslavia at the time and therefore avoided the crackdown. He spent the next two decades in exile in Switzerland, becoming a citizen there in 1983. Šik briefly returned to public life when, in the wake of the Velvet Revolution of 1989, he was appointed to Pres. Václav Havel’s board of economic advisers.
