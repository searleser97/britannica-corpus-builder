Chō,  produce tax of early Japan, payable in commodities other than rice—usually raw silk and cotton, though occasionally timber and fish. Although instituted earlier in some areas of the country, the tax was not generally adopted until the Taika  reforms (645–649 ce) established strong imperial control. The chō was levied on peasant communities according to capability and age. Males between the ages of 21 and 60 paid the full tax; those between 60 and 65, half the standard rate; and those between 17 and 21, a fourth of the standard. The chō tax gradually disappeared around the middle of the 9th century during the Heian period (794–1185) with the decline of central authority over the outlying areas of the country.
