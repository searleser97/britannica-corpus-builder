William Z. Foster, in full William Zebulon Foster,  (born February 25, 1881, Taunton, Massachusetts, U.S.—died September 1, 1961, Moscow, Russia, U.S.S.R.), American labour agitator and Communist Party leader who ran for the presidency in 1924, 1928, and 1932.
A militant union organizer from 1894, Foster joined the Industrial Workers of the World (1909), which aimed at achieving socialism through industry-wide labour organization. He came into national prominence as an American Federation of Labor leader in the bloody steel strike of 1919. In 1921 the Russian communists designated Foster’s Trade Union Educational League (which he had founded in 1920) as the American branch of their Profintern (Red Trade Union International), thereby moving him into the American communist organization as a top leader. He was a candidate three times for president, running on a platform that envisioned the ultimate demise of capitalism and the establishment of a workers’ republic.
In 1932 Foster suffered a serious heart attack, and party leadership passed to coworker Earl Browder. When the international communist leadership indicated its dissatisfaction with Browder in 1945, Foster again became party chairman. In 1948 he was among the party leaders indicted for subversive activity, but, because of his precarious health, he was not brought to trial.
Foster’s control of the party was endangered in 1956, when the Soviets’ repudiation of Joseph Stalin and their suppression of the Hungarian Revolution caused an upheaval within the party. Foster, who steadfastly defended the Soviet leadership, was made chairman emeritus at the party’s national convention in New York City (February 1957) and was thus, in effect, removed from power.
