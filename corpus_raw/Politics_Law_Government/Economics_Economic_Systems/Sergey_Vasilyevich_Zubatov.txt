Sergey Vasilyevich Zubatov,  (born 1864, Moscow, Russia—died  March 15 [March 2, Old Style], 1917, Moscow), tsarist colonel of the Russian gendarmes known for his establishment of a system of surveillance to monitor the activities of revolutionary organizations.
Zubatov became an agent of the Moscow department of the Okhranka, the tsarist secret police that was a division of the Ministry of the Interior, in 1884. From 1896 to 1902 he was the head of the Moscow Okhranka.
Between 1901 and 1903 Zubatov established the legal progovernment workers’ organizations that were later given his name. His tactic is now referred to as Zubatovism, or Zubatovshchina. The aim of these organizations was to divert workers from social agitation by drawing them into organizations making purely economic demands for reform and operating under the secret surveillance of the police. The first of these societies was the Society of Mutual Aid of Workers in Mechanical Production, created in 1901 in Moscow and followed in the same year by the Jewish Independent Workers Party in Minsk and Vilna. The rhetoric of their organizers caused the radical press to brand the movement “police socialism.” On Feb. 19, 1902, these organizations held a mass demonstration at the monument to Alexander II.
As Zubatov’s organizations attracted more workers, they became more difficult to control. After a series of demonstrations degenerated into the general strike of 1903, the organizations were liquidated, and Zubatov, who had also been involved in unsuccessful intrigues against the interior minister, was relieved of his duties and banished to Vladimir.
His banishment was rescinded the following year. During the revolution of 1917, fearing that he would be the victim of the revolutionaries, Zubatov shot himself.
