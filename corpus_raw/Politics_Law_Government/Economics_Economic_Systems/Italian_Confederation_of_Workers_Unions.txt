Italian Confederation of Workers’ Unions,  Italian Confederazione Italiana dei Sindacati Lavoratori (CISL),    Italy’s second largest trade union federation. The CISL was formed in 1950 by the merger of the Free General Italian Confederation of Labour (Libera Confederazione Generale Italiana dei Lavoratori) and the Italian Federation of Labour (Federazione Italiana del Lavoro). From its founding it had strong ties with Roman Catholics and Christian Democrats. It vigorously opposed Italy’s largest trade union federation, the communist-led General Italian Confederation of Labour (Confederazione Generale Italiana del Lavoro, or CGIL). The CISL has been much less militant than the CGIL and has tended to take a cooperative, rather than confrontational, approach toward private industry and government.  The CISL is affiliated with the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
