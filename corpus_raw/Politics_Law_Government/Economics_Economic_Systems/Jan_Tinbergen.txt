Jan Tinbergen,  (born April 12, 1903, The Hague, Neth.—died June 9, 1994, Netherlands),  Dutch economist noted for his development of econometric models. He was the cowinner (with Ragnar Frisch) of the first Nobel Prize for Economics, in 1969.
Tinbergen was the brother of the zoologist Nikolaas Tinbergen and was educated at the University of Leiden. He served as a business-cycle statistician with the Dutch government’s Central Bureau of Statistics (1929–36, 1938–45) before becoming the director of the Central Planning Bureau (1945–55). From 1933 to 1973 he was also a professor of economics at the Netherlands School of Economics (now part of Erasmus University), Rotterdam, and he then taught for two years at the University of Leiden before retiring in 1975.
While acting as an economic adviser to the League of Nations at Geneva (1936–38), Tinbergen analyzed economic development in the United States from 1919 to 1932. This pioneering econometric study offered a foundation for his business-cycle theory and guidelines for economic stabilization. He also constructed an econometric model that helped shape both short-term and broader political-economic planning in the Netherlands.
Because of the political nature of his economic analyses, Tinbergen was one of the first to show that a government with multiple policy objectives, such as full employment and price stability, must be able to draw on multiple economic policy tools—say, monetary policy and fiscal policy—to achieve the desired results. Among his major works are Statistical Testing of Business Cycles (1938), Econometrics (1942), Economic Policy (1956), and Income Distribution (1975).
