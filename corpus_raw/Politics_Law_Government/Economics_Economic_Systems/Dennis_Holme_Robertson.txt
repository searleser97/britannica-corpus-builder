Sir Dennis Holme Robertson,  (born May 23, 1890, Lowestoft, Suffolk, Eng.—died April 21, 1963, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire), British economist who was an early supporter of John Maynard Keynes but later produced cogent criticisms of his work.
Robertson was educated at Eton and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated with first class honours in 1912. Between 1938 and 1944 he taught at the University of London and did war-related work for the Treasury. From 1944 to 1957 he was a professor at Cambridge. Robertson was knighted in 1953.
At Cambridge he studied under Keynes, with whom he formed a long collaboration. Robertson’s first book, A Study of Industrial Fluctuation (1915), emphasized real rather than monetary forces, especially the interaction of invention and investment, in the trade cycle. However, in Money (1922), he turned his attention to monetary forces. Like Keynes, he maintained that government policy should attempt to stabilize the price level and that bank deposits were of paramount importance to the money supply. In subsequent work Robertson developed a dynamic theory of saving and investment that was quite possibly more sophisticated than the one later developed by Keynes; it was one of the key features in his criticism of Keynes’s The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (1935–36) and a major reason for the breaking of his association with Keynes. Robertson was also known for his study of business cycles.
