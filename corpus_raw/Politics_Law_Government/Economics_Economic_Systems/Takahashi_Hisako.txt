Takahashi Hisako,  (born September 21, 1927, Yokohama, Japan—died December 21, 2013), Japanese economist and government official who became the first female member of the Supreme Court of Japan (1994–97).
After graduating from Ochanomizu University, Takahashi did postgraduate work in economics at the University of Tokyo. In 1953 she entered the Women’s Bureau of the Ministry of Labour, where she was immediately named chief of the employment statistics section. She was then reassigned to head the women and youth section, where she was appalled to find that female employees were still required to perform such menial tasks as cleaning desks and serving tea. This and other instances of gender discrimination prompted Takahashi to advocate improvements in the social status of Japanese women. Years later she won a significant victory when the government passed the 1983 Equal Employment Opportunity Law, which affirmed equal rights for women.
Takahashi represented Japan at the 1980 meeting of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). In 1982 she resigned from government service to become director of the Asian Women’s Interchange Research Forum, a government affiliate established to further relations and interchange between women of Asia. The following year she was named president of a similar organization, the 21st Century Occupational Foundation.
Takahashi frequently criticized the Japanese judiciary system for its failure to appoint women. Noting the female justices serving on the U.S. Supreme Court, Takahashi also decried the absence of women on the Supreme Court of Japan. That difference was reduced and the cause of women’s rights in Japan significantly advanced when Prime Minister Hosokawa Morihiro appointed Takahashi to fill a vacancy on the 15-member Supreme Court in 1994. She retired from the bench in 1997.
