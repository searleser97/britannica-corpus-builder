Restraint of trade,  prevention of free competition in business by some action or condition such as price-fixing or the creation of a monopoly. The United States has a long-standing policy of maintaining competition between business enterprises through antitrust laws, the best-known of which, the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, declared illegal “every contract, combination … or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce.”
