Oliver E. Williamson, in full Oliver Eaton Williamson,  (born September 27, 1932, Superior, Wisconsin, U.S.—died May 21, 2020, Oakland, California), American social scientist who, with Elinor Ostrom, was awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences “for his analysis of economic governance, especially the boundaries of the firm.”
Williamson earned a bachelor’s degree in management from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan School of Management (1955), a master’s degree in business administration from Stanford University (1960), and a Ph.D. in economics from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh (1963). He was an assistant professor of economics at the University of California at Berkeley until 1965, when he began teaching at the University of Pennsylvania. He was an associate professor from 1965 to 1968 and professor from 1968 to 1983. In 1983 he was named the Gordon B. Tweedy Professor of Economics of Law and Organization at Yale University, a position he held until 1988 when he returned to Berkeley. At Berkeley Williamson served as professor of the graduate school and the Edgar F. Kaiser Professor of Business, Economics, and Law (from 1998) in the Haas School of Business, becoming emeritus in 2004.
He was a consultant to various entities, including the RAND Corporation (1964–66), the U.S. Department of Justice (1967–69), the National Science Foundation (1976–77), and the Federal Trade Commission (1978–80). He authored several books on economics, including The Economic Institutions of Capitalism: Firms, Markets, Relational Contracting (1985) and The Mechanisms of Governance (1996).
In 2009 Williamson and Elinor Ostrom were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for their work in the area of economic governance, or the ways in which economic systems and hierarchical organizations operate outside of the market, in terms of corporate conflict resolution. Williamson was credited with creating a new branch of economic thought—called New Institutional Economics—through his research.
