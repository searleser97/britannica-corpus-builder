Septic tank,  sewage treatment and disposal unit used principally for single residences not connected to municipal sewerage systems. It consists ordinarily of either a single- or double-compartment concrete or fibreglass tank buried in the ground. Solids settle to the bottom of the tank and are partially decomposed by anaerobic bacterial metabolism in the sludge. Grease and floating solids are blocked by a baffle at the top of the tank as the effluent flows out into a drain field, from which it percolates downward into the ground. After several years of use, the accumulated sludge must be pumped out of the tank for disposal at a municipal sewage-treatment plant. When properly designed, installed, and maintained, septic tanks and drain fields provide effective long-term, low-cost, on-site wastewater disposal.
