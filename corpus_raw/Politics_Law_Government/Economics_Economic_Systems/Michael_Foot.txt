Michael Foot, in full Michael Mackintosh Foot,  (born July 23, 1913, Plymouth, Devon, Eng.—died March 3, 2010, Hampstead, London), leader of Britain’s Labour Party from November 1980 to October 1983 and an intellectual left-wing socialist.
Foot was a member of a strongly Liberal family (his father had been a member of Parliament). He attended Wadham College, Oxford, and then began a career as a newspaper editor and columnist (1937–74). The mass unemployment of the 1930s turned him to socialism, and from 1945 to 1992, apart from a break between 1955 and 1960, he was a Labour member of Parliament. In 1974 he established himself as a leading member of Prime Minister Harold Wilson’s cabinet, first as secretary of state for employment (1974–76) in charge of complex and controversial trade-union legislation and then (1976–79) as leader of the House of Commons, a role that required him to hold the parliamentary party together. From deputy leader of the Labour Party (1976–80), he rose to become the party’s chief, defeating Denis Healey, the candidate of Labour’s right wing, in November 1980 by a vote of 139 to 129. This vote, as well as other leftward trends in the party, caused some right-wing Labourites to resign from the party and four months later to found the Social Democratic Party. Following a disastrous showing in the June 1983 general election, Foot announced that he would not continue as party leader. Neil G. Kinnock succeeded him in October 1983.
Foot had acquired a reputation as a rebel of the left. For many years he was a pamphleteer and political writer, fervently espousing the cause of nuclear disarmament. He was a strong ally of the British trade unions and an advocate of sharply increased public expenditures and state ownership of industries. He wrote a number of books, including Aneurin Bevan, a Biography, 2 vol. (1962–73).
