Christmas card,  form of greeting card usually sent by mail as an expression of goodwill at Christmastime. Although many cards display religious symbols or themes, secular winter motifs are equally popular. The practice of sending Christmas cards, which has been followed in all English-speaking countries, is growing in many others.
The first Christmas card, as the term is now understood, is believed to have been designed in England in 1843 by John Callcott Horsley. An edition of 1,000 hand-coloured copies was placed on sale in London. A triptych, the card depicted a family party in the centre, beneath which were the words “A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to You.” In the United States the owner of a variety store in Albany, New York, in the mid 19th century produced a card carrying Christmas greetings from “Pease’s Great Variety Store in the Temple of Fancy.” Boston lithographer Louis Prang is credited with producing the first commercial Christmas cards in the United States; by the 1880s he was producing more than five million a year, using the chromolithography process, which allows subtle and realistic coloration and detail.
