Ralph Helstein,  (born Dec. 11, 1908, Duluth, Minn., U.S.—died  Feb. 14, 1985, Chicago, Ill.), American labour union official who was president of the United Packinghouse Workers of America (UPWA) from 1946 to 1968.
Helstein graduated from the University of Minnesota in 1929 and received his law degree there in 1934. He immediately took a position as a labour compliance officer with the federal government, overseeing enforcement of the labour codes in the National Recovery Act.
From 1936 to 1943 Helstein practiced law in Minneapolis, but from 1939 on he was deeply involved in union activities. It was in 1939 that he became general counsel to the Minnesota Industrial Union Council (part of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, or CIO), and he stayed there for three years until offered a similar post with the UPWA in 1942. By 1946 he was president of the union.
As UPWA president, Helstein won members a guaranteed workweek and improved working conditions. And despite a prolonged and largely unsuccessful strike against most of the principal American meatpacking companies in 1948, the UPWA increased membership during Helstein’s tenure. By 1946 Helstein was also serving on the CIO executive board, and he later became a vice president of the AFL-CIO, serving until 1969. A year earlier, the UPWA merged with the Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmen of North America (AMCBWNA), and Helstein became a vice president as well as special counsel of the new organization. In 1968–69 he retired from his various union positions.
