Distribution theory,  in economics, the systematic attempt to account for the sharing of the national income among the owners of the factors of production—land, labour, and capital. Traditionally, economists have studied how the costs of these factors and the size of their return—rent, wages, and profits—are fixed.
The theory of distribution involves three distinguishable sets of questions. First, how is the national income distributed among persons? How many persons earn less than $10,000, how many between $10,000 and $20,000, how many between $20,000 and $30,000, and so on? Are there regularities in these statistics? Is it possible to generalize about them? This is the problem of personal distribution. Second, what determines the prices of the factors of production? What are the influences governing the wage rate for a specific kind of labour? Why is the general wage level of a country not lower or higher than it is? What determines the rate of interest? What determines profits and rents? These questions have to do with functional distribution. Third, how is the national income distributed proportionally among the factors of production? What determines the share of labour in the national income, the share of capital, the share of land? This is the problem of distributive shares. Although the three sets of problems are obviously interrelated, they should not be confused with one another. The theoretical approaches to each of them involve quite different considerations.
