Christina H. Paxson, in full Christina Hull Paxson,  (born February 6, 1960), American economist who made substantial contributions to the fields of health economics and public policy.
Paxson grew up in Forest Hills, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh. She earned a bachelor’s degree in economics from Swarthmore College in 1982 and master’s and doctoral degrees in economics from Columbia University in 1985 and 1987, respectively. She was appointed to the economics faculty at Princeton University as a lecturer in 1986 and became an assistant professor the following year. She was promoted to associate professor in 1994 and to full professor in 1997, and in 2007 she was named the Hughes-Rogers Professor of Economics and Public Affairs. Paxson also served as dean of Princeton’s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs from 2009 to 2012. In 2000 she founded Princeton’s Center for Health and Wellbeing, which established multidisciplinary graduate and undergraduate certificate programs in health and health policy. In 2012 she joined Brown University as professor of economics and public policy and university president.
Paxson’s early research focused on international economic issues of workplace inequality, labour market mobility, and aging. Her research interests subsequently shifted toward health economics, a field in which she authored pioneering papers that analyzed the relationship between economic factors and health, especially that of children. Her research covered a broad spectrum of issues ranging from the impact of AIDS in Africa to the effects of Hurricane Katrina on low-income mothers in the United States. The value of her rigorous data-focused approach was recognized in her appointment as principle investigator for a number of projects sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
