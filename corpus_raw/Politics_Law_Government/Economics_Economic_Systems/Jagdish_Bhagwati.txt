Jagdish Bhagwati,  (born August 5, 1934, Bombay [now Mumbai], India), Indian American economist known for his contributions to the theory of international trade and economic development.
Bhagwati attended St. Xavier’s High School and Sydenham College in Bombay (now Mumbai). After receiving a B.A. degree in economics and law at the University of Cambridge, he pursued postgraduate studies in economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the University of Oxford (1956–59). In 1961 he returned to India to teach economics at the Indian Statistical Institute and international trade at the Delhi School of Economics. He joined the economics faculty of MIT in 1968 and eventually became Ford International Professor of Economics. From 1980 he taught economics at Columbia University, where he was Arthur Lehman Professor of Economics and Professor of Political Science and later University Professor, Economics and Law. Bhagwati also served as an expert adviser to several international and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), including the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the World Trade Organization, and Human Rights Watch.
In his academic publications as well as in his writings for the popular press, Bhagwati was a forceful advocate for free trade and economic globalization. He specifically opposed the inclusion of labour and environmental standards in free-trade agreements (see free-trade zone), arguing that workers and the environment are better protected through public pressure on offending corporations.
Bhagwati published hundreds of articles and scores of books, the latter including Free Trade Today (2002) and In Defense of Globalization (2004). His writings on public policy were collected in A Stream of Windows: Unsettling Reflections on Trade, Immigration, and Democracy (1998) and The Wind of the Hundred Days: How Washington Mismanaged Globalization (2000).
