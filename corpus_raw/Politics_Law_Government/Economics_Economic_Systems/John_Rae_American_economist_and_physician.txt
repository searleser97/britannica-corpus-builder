John Rae,  (born June 1, 1796, Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire, Scotland—died July 12, 1872, New York, New York, U.S.), Scottish-born American economist, physician, and teacher.
Rae was educated in classics, mathematics, and medicine at the Universities of Aberdeen and Edinburgh, and he distinguished himself as an inventor and natural scientist as well as an economist. In 1822 he immigrated to Canada, where he pursued a career as a schoolteacher. When he lost his teaching position (1848), he returned to the practice of medicine. His work as a doctor led him to the California gold fields, to the Hawaiian Islands, and then back to the United States in 1871.
Rae is best known, however, for his achievements in economics. He advanced a theory of economic development that contained several elements that brought him largely posthumous fame. Prominent among these was his theory of capital, which contained two ideas that contributed to the development of the Austrian theory of capital (see Austrian school of economics). The first idea was that extra capital will increase total output only by lengthening the production process. The second was that current output is always preferred to future output. Rae’s interest in capital goods and in natural science led to a detailed discussion of the process of invention. His work influenced the economists John Stuart Mill and Joseph A. Schumpeter.
