Transport and General Workers’ Union (TGWU), also called T&G,  labour union that was the largest in Great Britain throughout much of the 20th century. It originated in 1889 with the formation of the Dockers’ Union. In 1922 that union led the merger of 14 unions to form an organization representing more than 300,000 workers. A dominant influence in the TGWU’s formation and growth was Ernest Bevin, the union’s first general secretary (1922–40).
As a general union, the TGWU maintained a policy of enrolling workers who had been excluded by the rigid requirements of the craft unions. As a result, the TGWU underwent remarkable growth, with membership exceeding two million in the 1970s. Members came from nearly all of the transportation industries (except railroads) and from automobile, construction, chemical, textile, and other industries. By organizing both semiskilled and unskilled workers, especially in smaller manufacturing trades, the general unions such as the TGWU represented workers traditionally ignored by the craft unions and industrial unions.
The TGWU was characterized by an unusual degree of internal democracy and stability, and its relationships with the Trades Union Congress and the Labour Party allowed the union to exert considerable influence on general trade union policy in Britain. In the later years of the 20th century, however, the TGWU and other British trade unions experienced significant declines in membership and influence, and in 2007 the TGWU merged with Amicus, the large successor of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union (AEEU), to form Unite, which became the largest trade union in the United Kingdom, representing about 1.5 million British and Irish workers.
