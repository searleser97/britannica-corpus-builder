James J. Heckman, in full James Joseph Heckman,  (born April 19, 1944, Chicago, Ill., U.S.), American economist, educator, and cowinner (with Daniel McFadden) of the 2000 Nobel Prize for Economics for his development of theory and methods used in the analysis of individual or household behaviour, such as understanding how people choose where to work, where to live, or when to get married. He was recognized as a leading researcher of the microevaluation of labour-market programs.
Heckman studied mathematics at Colorado College (B.A., 1965) and economics at Princeton University (M.A., 1968; Ph.D., 1971). He taught at New York University (1972) and Columbia University (1970–74) before joining (1973) the economics faculty at the University of Chicago, where he was named the Henry Schultz Distinguished Service Professor of Economics in 1995. From 1988 to 1990 he also taught at Yale University. Heckman served as a research professor for the American Bar Foundation (ABF) from 1991. From 2004 to 2008 he held the Distinguished Chair of Microeconometrics at University College London. Heckman became Professor of Science and Society at University College Dublin in 2006.
Heckman’s work in selective samples led him to develop methods (such as the Heckman correction) for overcoming statistical sample-selection problems. When a sample fails to represent reality, the statistical analyses based on those samples can lead to erroneous policy decisions. The Heckman correction, a two-step statistical approach, offers a means of correcting for sampling errors.
Heckman is the author of more than 200 papers and has contributed to and edited several books, including (with Alan B. Krueger and Benjamin M. Friedman) Inequality in America: What Role for Human Capital Policies (2002). He served on the editorial staffs of a number of publications, including Journal of Economic Perspectives, Journal of Econometrics, Journal of Labor Economics, The Review of Economics and Statistics, and Journal of Political Economy.
In 1983 he was awarded the John Bates Clark Medal by the American Economics Association, and in 1992 he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. In 2008 he served as a policy analyst in the presidential campaign of Barack Obama.
