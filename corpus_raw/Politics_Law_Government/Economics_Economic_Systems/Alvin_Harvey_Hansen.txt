Alvin Harvey Hansen,  (born August 23, 1887, Viborg, South Dakota, U.S.—died June 6, 1975, Alexandria, Virginia),  American economist noted for his strong and influential advocacy of the theories of John Maynard Keynes.
Hansen was educated at Yankton College (B.A., 1910) and at the University of Wisconsin (Ph.D., 1918), where he studied under economists Richard T. Ely and John R. Commons. He taught at Brown University (1916–19) and then at the University of Minnesota (1919–37). In 1937 Hansen was appointed as the first Littauer Professor of Political Economy at Harvard University, and he retained that position until his retirement in 1962.
Hansen had a particular interest in fluctuations in economic activity, and his Business Cycle Theory (1927) criticized underconsumptionist theories—theories that blamed low economic growth and high unemployment on rates of saving that were “too high.” Though at first he advocated deflationary policies and opposed Keynes’s belief in the stimulation of demand, Hansen later became a leading proponent of Keynesian views in the United States. He built upon Keynes’s theory by developing the stagnation thesis, which states that, as an economy matures, opportunities for productive investment will diminish, which causes the economy’s rate of growth to decrease.
The stagnation thesis has not stood the test of time, however, having been discredited by sustained periods of strong economic growth. Yet Hansen’s theory was adopted in the government policies of his time, no doubt because of his influence as an adviser to various U.S. government agencies and commissions. He also served on the committee that worked to create the U.S. Social Security system.
Hansen was also an eminent educator. Among his many noteworthy students at Harvard were Paul McCracken and Paul Samuelson. Moreover, Hansen is remembered by generations of students as the author of Guide to Keynes (1953), a classic text on Keynesian economics.
