Critical path analysis (CPA),  technique for controlling and coordinating the various activities necessary in completing a major project. It utilizes a chart that consists essentially of a series of circles, each of which represents a particular part of a project, and lines representing the activities that link these parts together. The critical path is the minimum time that a project can take, represented by the greatest of the times that are obtained by totalling the individual activities on any path from start to finish.
