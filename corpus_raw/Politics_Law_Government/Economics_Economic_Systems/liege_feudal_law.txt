Liege,   (probably from German ledig, “empty” or “free”), in European feudal society, an unconditional bond between a man and his overlord. Thus, if a tenant held estates of various overlords, his obligations to his liege lord (usually the lord of his largest estate or of that he had held the longest), to whom he had done “liege homage,” were greater than, and in the event of conflict overrode, his obligations to the other lords, to whom he had done only “simple homage.” This concept of liegeance is found in France as early as the 11th century and may have originated in Normandy. By the 13th century it was important because it determined not so much which lord a man should follow in a war or a dispute but which lord was entitled to the traditional pecuniary profits of overlordship from that particular tenant. In some places, such as Lotharingia (Lorraine), the distinction became virtually meaningless, men doing liege homage to several lords. In any case, the king was always considered a subject’s liege lord, and clauses reserving the allegiance due to him came to be inserted in all feudal contracts. For this reason a ceremony of homage became part of the English coronation rite from the late 13th century.
