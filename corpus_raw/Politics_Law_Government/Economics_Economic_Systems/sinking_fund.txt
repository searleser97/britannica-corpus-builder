Sinking fund,   fund accumulated and set aside by a corporation or government agency for the purpose of periodically redeeming bonds, debentures, and preferred stocks. The fund is accumulated from earnings, and payments into the fund may be based on either a fixed percentage of the outstanding debt or a fixed percentage of profits. Sinking funds are administered separately from the corporationâ€™s working funds by a trust company or a sinking-fund trustee.
The funds may be used immediately to retire the bonds for which the fund was established; however, in most cases sinking-fund administrators opt to save money by investing the fund in conservative bonds purchased on the open market. Revenues from these investments are then added to the fund; for example, $1,000,000 can be added to the sinking fund at a cost of only $500,000 if bonds can be purchased at a 50 percent discount to the face value. The purpose of a sinking fund is to assure investors that provision has been made for repayment of bonds at maturity.
