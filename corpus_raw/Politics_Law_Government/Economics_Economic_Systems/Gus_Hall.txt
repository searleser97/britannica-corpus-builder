Gus Hall , original name Arvo Kusta Halber,  (born October 8, 1910, Iron, Minnesota, U.S.—died October 13, 2000, New York, New York, U.S.), American political organizer who was general secretary of the Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA; 1959–2000) and a four-time candidate for U.S. president (1972, 1976, 1980, 1984).
Hall’s parents were members of the militant Industrial Workers of the World, and in 1927 he was recruited by his father to join the CPUSA. From 1931 to 1933 he studied at the V.I. Lenin Institute (renamed the Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute) in Moscow, and after returning to the United States, he engaged in union-organizing activities, occasionally getting arrested. He became a full-time party officer in 1937. Following service in the navy during World War II, Hall joined the CPUSA’s national executive board. In 1949 he was one of 11 party leaders convicted of conspiring to overthrow the U.S. government by force and was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. Free on bail during an appeal, Hall and three others fled to Mexico when the appeal was rejected in 1951. They were recaptured, however, and Hall’s sentence was extended; he was incarcerated until 1957.
Elected to the CPUSA’s leadership position in 1959, Hall ran for U.S. president as the party’s candidate in four elections and earned his best result in 1976, when he received nearly 60,000 votes. He made annual trips to Moscow until the fall of the communist regime and was awarded the U.S.S.R.’s highest civilian medal, the Order of Lenin. Although the CPUSA’s adherence to its faith in Soviet-style communism kept it apart from the new left and its membership dwindled steadily, Hall remained general secretary of the party until his death.
