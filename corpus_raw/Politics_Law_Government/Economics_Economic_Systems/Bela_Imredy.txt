Béla Imrédy,  (born Dec. 29, 1891, Budapest, Hung.—died  Feb. 28, 1946, Budapest), right-wing politician and premier of Hungary (1938–39), whose close collaboration with the Nazis during World War II led to his execution as a war criminal.
After being trained in law, Imrédy began working for the Ministry of Finances. In 1928 he became director of the National Bank of Hungary and participated in several international monetary conferences. He then served as finance minister (1932–35) under the extreme rightist Gyula Gömbös. After Gömbös died (Oct. 6, 1936) Imrédy resigned and became president of the National Bank.
Nazi Germany annexed Austria in March 1938, and Imrédy was made premier of Hungary on May 14, 1938. Although he took measures against the extreme right and made several unsuccessful attempts to win support from the Western powers, Imrédy oversaw the passage of many laws supported by the right wing, including two measures limiting the activity of Jews in business and the professions as well as laws restricting the right of assembly and freedom of the press. He also ultimately adopted a more definite pro-Axis foreign policy for Hungary. On Feb. 16, 1939, he resigned after the opposition had documented his Jewish ancestry; he retained leadership, however, in numerous rightist organizations and as minister of the economy in 1944 was instrumental in subordinating Hungarian economy to the German war effort. After the war Imrédy was sentenced for war crimes by the People’s Tribunal and executed.
