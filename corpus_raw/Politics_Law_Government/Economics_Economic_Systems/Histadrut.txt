Histadrut, English General Federation of Labour,  Israeli labour organization that includes workers in the cooperative and collective agricultural settlements as well as in most industries. Organized in 1920, Histadrut is the largest voluntary organization in Israel and the most important economic body in the state. Its activities extend beyond the traditional concerns of labour unions.
Histadrut includes marketing and distribution agencies for consumer goods, materials, and equipment; a vast construction enterprise that builds settlements and public institutions; credit societies and banks; and trade unions and cooperative groups in every branch of work. The organization also deals with wage rates and working conditions in private industry. Histadrut conducts, on a cooperative basis and often in partnership with private investors, major industrial and public enterprises—e.g., irrigation, shipping, and mining. Its varied enterprises account for more than 20 percent of the national income. It is also responsible for a health service and a system of social insurance. Its educational and cultural activities include secondary and technical schools, a widespread system of adult education, theatre companies, and the publication of books, newspapers, and technical journals.
Histadrut is administered by an executive bureau elected by an executive committee, which is in turn elected by convention delegates chosen by members. The organization’s leadership was dominated by the Mapai Party, which in 1968 merged with other parties to form the Labour Party. Histadrut is affiliated with the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
