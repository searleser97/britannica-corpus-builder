Viatical settlement,  arrangement by which a terminally ill patient’s life-insurance policy is sold to provide funds while the insured (viator) is living. The buyer (funder), usually an investment company, pays the patient a lump sum of 50–80 percent of the policy’s face value, pays the premiums until the patient dies, and receives the death benefit. Viatical settlements (from Latin viaticum, “provisions for a journey”) appeared in the 1980s, when people with AIDS had high medical bills and policies nominally sufficient to cover them but whose funds would not be available until they died.
