Antonio Genovesi,  (born Nov. 1, 1712, Castiglione, Republic of Venice [Italy]—died  Sept. 23, 1769, Naples, Republic of Naples), Italian philosopher and economist whose proposals for reforms in the Kingdom of Naples combined humanist ideas with a radical Christian metaphysical system.
Ordained a priest in 1737, Genovesi went to Naples in 1738 and in 1741 was appointed to teach metaphysics in the university there. Two years later he wrote the first volume of his Disciplinarum Metaphysicarum Elementa, 5 vol. (1743–52; “Elements of the Discipline of Metaphysics”). In 1745 his treatises on logic and on physics appeared. In 1748, however, charged with propagating heretical ideas in his Elementa, he decided not to publish his companion work on theology; it appeared after his death as Universae Christianae Theologiae Elementa (1771; “Elements of Universal Christian Theology”).
His fortunes improved in 1753, when he dedicated a discourse on agriculture to Bartolomeo Intieri, who founded at Naples the first European chair of “commerce and mechanics” (i.e., political economy) in 1754 and directed that Genovesi be its first occupant. There he wrote and lectured. Genovesi’s mercantilist view of economics is distinguished by a brilliant analysis of demand, by his high valuation of labour, and by his efforts to reconcile free competition with protectionist policies. In political philosophy he held that ecclesiastical authority should not extend beyond strictly spiritual matters, and the increasingly humanist regime of Naples welcomed his view that the state should dispossess clerical and religious orders of their lands.
