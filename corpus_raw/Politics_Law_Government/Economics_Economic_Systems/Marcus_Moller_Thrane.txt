Marcus Møller Thrane,  (born Oct. 14, 1817, Christiania [now Oslo], Nor.—died  April 30, 1890, Eau Claire, Wis., U.S.), teacher, journalist, and socialist leader who was the initiator of the Thrane movement in Norway that sought to better the condition of urban and rural labourers.
Educated in France, where he became an exponent of utopian socialism, Thrane began his career as a teacher but then turned to journalism. Dismissed from his position in 1848 for attacks on capitalism, he set about to organize local workmen’s associations in the same year. By 1850 the organizations were numerous, a national coordinating body had been formed, and a national convention held. In its petition to the king and the Storting (parliament), the Thrane movement, supported mainly by urban and rural workers, as well as by crofters (tenant farmers) and peasants, called for mass education, universal suffrage, an investigation of the conditions of crofters, and an end to protective tariffs. While the movement’s demands were rejected, its growing popularity so frightened the middle and upper classes that Thrane and 132 others were arrested. Thrane was convicted of sedition in 1851 because of the revolutionary rhetoric of certain individuals in the movement, although it was clearly established that he opposed revolution.
After four years of imprisonment, during which the Thrane movement collapsed, Thrane emigrated to the United States, where he published a series of Norwegian-language socialist newspapers in Chicago.
