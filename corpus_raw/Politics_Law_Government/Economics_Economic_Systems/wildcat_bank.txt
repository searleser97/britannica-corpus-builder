Wildcat bank,   unsound bank chartered under state law during the period of uncontrolled state banking (1816â€“63) in the United States. Such banks distributed nearly worthless currency backed by questionable security (e.g., mortgages, bonds) and were located in inaccessible areas to discourage note redemption. Note circulation by state banks ended after the passage of the National Bank Act of 1863, which provided for the incorporation of national banks under federal law and the issue of bank notes on the security of government bonds. The term wildcat bank was subsequently applied to any unstable bank.
