Harry Bridges, original name Alfred Bryant Renton Bridges,  (born July 28, 1901, Kensington, near Melbourne, Victoria, Australia—died March 30, 1990, San Francisco, California, U.S.), Australian-born American labour leader, president of the San Francisco-based International Longshoremen’s and Warehousemen’s Union (ILWU) from 1937 to 1977.
Bridges left home to become a maritime seaman at the age of 16 and in 1920 legally entered the United States, where he worked as a seaman and dockworker and quickly became involved in strikes and labour agitation. In 1922 he settled in San Francisco as a longshoreman, and by the 1930s he was fully engaged in the local branch of the International Longshoremen’s Association (ILA), eventually aligning himself with the union’s militant, strongly leftist “Albion Hall” group. In 1934 an ILA strike expanded into a general strike of workers in San Francisco, with Bridges as one of the leaders. In June 1937, alienated from the ILA leadership, he led his Pacific Coast division out of the ILA and reconstituted it as the ILWU, affiliated with the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). In 1945 he became a naturalized U.S. citizen.
From 1939 to 1953 his aggressive labour tactics (he organized the Hawaiian sugar and pineapple workers in 1944–46 with particular vigour), together with his Communist Party connections, and his vocal opposition to the cold war, resulted in conservative efforts to have him deported—efforts that were ultimately unsuccessful in the courts. However, the CIO in 1950 expelled the ILWU during its purge of allegedly communist-dominated unions.
In later years, Bridges was less militant. In 1960 he negotiated with shippers a model Mechanization and Modernization Agreement, which allowed the introduction of automation in exchange for wage and pension guarantees. He retired in 1977.
