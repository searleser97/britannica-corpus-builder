Foreign workers,  Those who work in a foreign country without initially intending to settle there and without the benefits of citizenship in the host country. Some are recruited to supplement the workforce of a host country for a limited term or to provide skills on a contractual basis that the host country seeks. Others are recruited directly by a private employer, which may need to certify that it cannot find workers among the country’s own citizens. Host countries may also import foreign workers for jobs their citizens refuse to do. Large influxes of foreign workers can awaken xenophobia, particularly when the host country’s population is ethnically and culturally homogeneous and the foreign workers’ culture and appearance are significantly different or when economic downturns heighten the tendency to assign blame to others.
