Jacobus Nienhuys,  (born July 15, 1836, Rhenen, Neth.â€”died July 27, 1927, Bloemendaal), Dutch businessman and planter who was responsible for establishing the tobacco industry in Sumatra (now part of Indonesia).
Nienhuys went to Sumatra in 1863 in hopes of purchasing tobacco as a middleman but found production there insufficient for commercial exploitation. To increase the output he imported Chinese labour from Singapore and began cultivating tobacco around what is now the Medan area. The leaves produced there were of exceptionally high quality and were normally used as wrappers for cigars. Originally only a single crop of tobacco was raised on a piece of ground, in the belief that it permanently sapped the fertility of the soil. Later it was discovered that eight fallow years were sufficient to restore soil fertility, and plots of land began to be reused.
Nienhuys in 1869 established the Deli Company, dealing in tropical produce, and returned to the Netherlands the following year for reasons of health. From 1880 until his death he was commissioner for the company.
