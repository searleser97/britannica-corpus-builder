Pleading,  in law, written presentation by a litigant in a lawsuit setting forth the facts upon which he claims legal relief or challenges the claims of his opponent. A pleading includes claims and counterclaims but not the evidence by which the litigant intends to prove his case.
After both the plaintiff and the defendant have made their initial statements, there may be further pleadings, such as a reply, a rejoinder, and even a surrejoinder. It is open to either party to apply to strike out his opponent’s pleading, or parts thereof, on the grounds that it disclosed no cause of action or defense or on certain other grounds. Likewise, either party may seek further particulars of his opponent’s pleading, and the court may order that these be furnished. If a factual allegation is not refuted or denied, it is assumed to be admitted.
The rules make provision for the joinder of other parties whose participation is considered necessary by the court. Thus, a defendant under English law may issue a notice—called a third-party notice—containing a statement of the nature of the claim made by him against a third party, relevant to the original subject matter of the action or of issues to be determined. A third party has the same rights against the defendant as the latter has against the plaintiff; he may bring in a fourth party, who may bring in a fifth, and so on.
Pleadings in most countries are formal. In federal courts and in many state courts in the United States, “notice pleading” is permitted, which requires only that the pleading describe the transaction and alleged wrong in general terms. Under this system the specifics of the pleading are developed through discovery. In contrast, in countries with a civil-law tradition written pleadings are only preparatory to the main hearing in open court, where allegations are clarified and proofs offered.
