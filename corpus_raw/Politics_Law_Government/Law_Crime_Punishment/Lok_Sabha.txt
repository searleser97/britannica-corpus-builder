Lok Sabha, (Hindi: “House of the People”)  the lower chamber of India’s bicameral parliament. Under the constitution of 1950, its members are directly elected for a term of five years by territorial constituencies in the states. In the early 21st century the Lok Sabha had 543 elected members; 13 of these represented the union territories. Two additional members were appointed by the president to represent the Anglo-Indian community.
The president of India, who is elected for a five-year term by an electoral college consisting of all elected members of parliament and of the state legislatures, is more a constitutional sovereign than a chief executive. The real power resides in the prime minister, who heads the Council of Ministers—ministers who are members of the cabinet and other ministers of state and deputy ministers. The council is responsible to the Lok Sabha. The upper chamber of parliament is the Rajya Sabha (“Council of States”).
