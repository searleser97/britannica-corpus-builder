Chief justice,  the presiding judge in the Supreme Court of the United States, and the highest judicial officer of the nation. The chief justice is appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the Senate and has life tenure. His primary functions are to preside over the Supreme Court in its public sessions when the court is hearing arguments and during its private conferences when it is discussing and deciding cases. He serves as chairman in the court and has authority to assign the writing of opinions in cases where he is a member of the majority; otherwise his powers are the same as those of any other Supreme Court justice. The chief justice customarily administers the oath of office to the president and vice-president at the time of their inauguration. The chief justice is also the presiding officer of the Judicial Conference of the United States, an assembly of judges representing all the federal courts that reviews and investigates problems relating to the administration of justice in those courts.
When the office is occupied by a person of extraordinary intellectual capacity and dynamic personality, as was the case with John Marshall, the chief justice may exert a great influence on the courtâ€™s work. When the occupant of the centre chair is a lesser figure, as has often been the case, he is likely to be overshadowed by other members of the court.
The title of chief justice is also usually accorded to the presiding judicial officer within any multijudge court, as well as to the highest judicial officer within a state of the United States. In the United Kingdom the title of lord chief justice is held by the officer presiding over the judiciary of England and Wales (see lord chief justice).
