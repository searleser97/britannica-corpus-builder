Liability,   in law, a broad term including almost every type of duty, obligation, debt, responsibility, or hazard arising by way of contract, tort, or statute.
The extent of liability is often regulated by contract. For example, a limited partnership may often be formed so that certain partners designated as limited—as opposed to general—are liable for the firm’s obligations only to the extent of their contribution to the firm’s capital. Liability may also be governed by the customs of tort, as when children, insane persons, and other legally incompetent persons are not considered to be legally responsible for their actions.
The amount of liability may also be determined by reference to a statute. Thus, stockholders under certain statutes have a personal liability making them individually responsible for the debts of the corporation to the extent of the par value of their stock or some other specified limit.
