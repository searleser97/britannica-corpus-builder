Grievance procedure,  in industrial relations, process through which disagreements between individual workers and management may be settled. Typical grievances may include the promotion of one worker over another who has seniority, disputes over holiday pay, and problems related to worker discipline.
Grievance procedures are a significant issue in collective bargaining agreements in much of Europe and the United States. They usually detail a series of steps open to the worker, beginning with discussion between the foreman and the union steward and going up the line until a settlement has been reached. The final step in the United States is usually arbitration; in some European countries the grievance case may finally be appealed to a labour court.
In other countries, where issues other than the resolution of grievances have consistently been more important, grievance procedures have not been formalized. In several Latin American countries, for example, currency inflation has tended to concentrate the unions’ attention almost solely on wage increases, with the result that workers’ complaints are usually resolved through informal procedures.
The existence of formal procedures is no guarantee that an individual’s grievance will be resolved. In Japan, though grievance procedures modeled after the U.S. example are a part of most collective agreements, tradition tends to inhibit an individual from registering a personal grievance. Instead, problems are brought up in a general way by union leaders at regular negotiating sessions.
