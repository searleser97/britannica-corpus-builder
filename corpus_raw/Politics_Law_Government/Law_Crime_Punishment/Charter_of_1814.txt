Charter of 1814, French Charte Constitutionnelle,  French constitution issued by Louis XVIII after he became king (see Bourbon Restoration). The charter, which was revised in 1830 and remained in effect until 1848, preserved many liberties won by the French Revolution. It established a constitutional monarchy with a bicameral parliament, guaranteed civil liberties, proclaimed religious toleration, and acknowledged Catholicism as the state religion.
