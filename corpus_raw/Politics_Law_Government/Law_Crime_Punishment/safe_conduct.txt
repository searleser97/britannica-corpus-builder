Safe-conduct,   procedure by which a person is permitted to enter or leave a jurisdiction in which he would normally be subject to arrest, detention, or other deprivation. Historically, the habit of princes in granting safe-conducts to foreigners who, as aliens, did not ordinarily enjoy the full protection of the host-country’s law developed into the system of diplomatic immunity. Similarly, the granting of safe-conducts to protect freedom of commerce was the forerunner of modern treaties of commerce. Whether in modern times the granting by the authorities of a safe-conduct—as, for example, to a person enjoying asylum in a foreign embassy—entails any legal obligation under international or municipal law depends on the circumstances of each case. See also asylum; extraterritoriality.
