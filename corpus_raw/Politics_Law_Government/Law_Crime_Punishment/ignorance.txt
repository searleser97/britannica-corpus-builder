Ignorance,  in English and U.S. law (as in Roman law) falls into two categories: ignorance of law (ignorantia juris) and ignorance of fact (ignorantia facti).
In general, it is no defense to a criminal charge that the accused was unaware that the conduct was criminal. This principle has been thought to be essential to the effective administration of law and is justified by the practical consideration that, in cases of serious criminality, the accused is ordinarily aware of the wrongfulness of the conduct if not its criminality. A more doubtful question arises, however, in cases of statutory offenses involving conduct not obviously dangerous or immoral. A developing body of law permits exculpation for mistake of law in some such situations, particularly when the accused in good faith has made reasonable efforts to discover what the law is. Ignorance or mistake of fact provides a defense to a criminal charge when the mistaken view of the facts is inconsistent with the required criminal purpose. Thus, one who takes and carries away goods of another while believing them to be his own is not guilty of larceny since he lacks the intent to steal.
In civil matters, ignorance of the law is usually irrelevant. An agreement may not be repudiated because the promising party was ignorant that it was given under circumstances that would create a binding contract. On the other hand, ignorance of fact may relieve a party of liability or provide the basis for recovery, as where an insurance company pays the sum assured in ignorance of the fact that the policy had lapsed. Ignorance of foreign law, where relevant, is treated as ignorance of fact.
In logic, ignorance is contrasted with doubt. Each makes it impossible to affirm or deny one proposition or another, but ignorance is based on the absence of evidence, and doubt on the presence of equally strong evidence for each proposition.
