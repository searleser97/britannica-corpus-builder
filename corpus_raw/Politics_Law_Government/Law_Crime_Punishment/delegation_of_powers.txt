Delegation of powers,  in U.S. constitutional law, the transfer of a specific authority by one of the three branches of government (executive, legislative, and judicial) to another branch or to an independent agency. The U.S. Congress, for example, has created government agencies to which it has delegated authority to promulgate and enforce regulations pursuant to law—such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (1934) and the Federal Election Commission (1974)—and it has delegated by statute (1954) to the Department of Commerce, a cabinet office within the executive branch, its authority under the Constitution to conduct the decennial census.
Exercise by one branch of a power delegated to another violates the separation of powers provided for in the Constitution; i.e., it is unconstitutional. Constitutional powers may be classified as enumerated, implied, inherent, resulting, or sovereign—designations that explain the nature of a given power, its origin, and its scope of influence.
