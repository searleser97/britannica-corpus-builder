appanage,   in France, primarily before the Revolution, the provision of lands within the royal domain, or in some cases of pensions, to the children of the royal family so that they might live in a style corresponding to their position in society. Appanages were established to provide for the younger brothers and sisters of the king but were also given to an heir to the throne before his succession, at which time the land was reannexed to the crown. Appanages were most prevalent from the 13th to the 16th century.
Appanages raised certain problems for the crown, largely because of the personal relationship that existed between the holder and the king. At the same time, however, they afforded an opportunity for the growth and development of royal administration within the areas held by appanage, facilitating their ultimate reunion with the crown. After the 14th century, except in a few special instances, women ceased to receive land appanage but received pensions instead. In 1566 the Ordinance of Moulins established the principle of the inalienability of the domain, although during the Wars of Religion of the next 30 years it was not always strictly adhered to. With the growth of the absolute power of the monarch during the 17th century, appanages ceased to be much of a problem. Early in the French Revolution (1790), appanages were reduced to pensions or rents and then completely abolished. They were reestablished in 1810 according to the provisions of 1790 and finally abolished in 1832.
