USS Cole attack,  attack by Muslim militants associated with the organization al-Qaeda against a U.S. naval destroyer, the USS Cole, on October 12, 2000. Suicide bombers in a small boat steered their craft into the side of the USS Cole, which was preparing to refuel in the harbour in the Yemeni port of Aden; the blast ripped a 1,600-square-foot (150-square-metre) hole in its hull and left 17 sailors dead and 39 wounded.
In 2004 a Yemeni court tried Saudi-born ʿAbd al-Raḥīm al-Nashīrī in absentia for the USS Cole attack and sentenced him to death; U.S. military prosecutors filed charges against him in 2008. The U.S. proceedings were complicated by an admission by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) that waterboarding—an interrogation tactic that simulates drowning, banned by the CIA in 2006—was used during Nashīrī’s imprisonment at Guantánamo Bay; it was unclear whether evidence obtained through such means would be admissible in court.
