Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States,  case in which on May 27, 1935, the Supreme Court of the United States abolished the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA; see National Recovery Administration), a cornerstone of the New Deal. By unanimous vote, the court held that Congress had exceeded its authority by delegating too much legislative power to the president and industrial groups. It also found that NIRA’s “codes of fair practice” went beyond the regulation of interstate commerce in attempting to control intrastate activity. NIRA’s successor, the National Labor Relations Act (1935), proved acceptable to the court.
