1983 United States embassy bombing,  terrorist attack on the U.S. embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, on April 18, 1983, that killed 63 people. The attack was carried out as a suicide car bombing, in which a Chevrolet pickup truck that had been packed with about 2,000 pounds of explosives sped through the gate of the U.S. embassy in West Beirut and struck the building. The resulting blast killed 32 Lebanese workers, 17 Americans, and 14 other individuals. Among the Americans killed were a journalist and eight members of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). About 120 others were injured. Islamic Jihad, a group linked to the Iranian-backed Shīʿite Muslim militia group Hezbollah, claimed responsibility for the attack.
American forces had initially entered war-torn Lebanon in August 1982 as part of a multinational peacekeeping force that included French, Italian, and British personnel. The peacekeepers intended to negotiate a cease-fire between Lebanon and Israel, which had invaded the country two months prior. The pro-Iranian group that took responsibility for the attack objected to the presence of international forces in Lebanon.
The U.S. embassy attack was followed in October 1983 by bombings of U.S. Marine and French military barracks (see 1983 Beirut barracks bombings). The attack killed 241 U.S. Marines and 58 French paratroopers. The incident was also linked to Islamic Jihad. Five months following the second attack, the Lebanese government authority in West Beirut collapsed. In February 1984, U.S. officials announced the withdrawal of the U.S. troops, which was followed shortly thereafter by the pullout of Italian, British, and French troops.
