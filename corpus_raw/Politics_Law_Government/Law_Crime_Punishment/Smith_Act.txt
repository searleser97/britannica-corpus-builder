Smith Act, formally Alien Registration Act of 1940,  U.S. federal law passed in 1940 that made it a criminal offense to advocate the violent overthrow of the government or to organize or be a member of any group or society devoted to such advocacy. The first prosecutions under the Smith Act, of leaders of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP), took place in 1941. After World War II the statute was used against the leadership of the American Communist Party (Communist Party of the United States of America; CPUSA). The convictions of the principal officers of the CPUSA (1949) were sustained—and the constitutionality of the advocacy provision of the Smith Act upheld—by the U.S. Supreme Court in Dennis v. United States (1951). In a later case, Yates v. United States (1957), the court offset that ruling somewhat by adopting a strict reading of the advocacy provision, construing “advocacy” to mean only urging that includes incitement to unlawful action.
