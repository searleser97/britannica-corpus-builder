Pontifical Gendarmerie, Italian Gendarmeria Pontifica,  former police force of Vatican City. The Pontifical, or Papal, Gendarmerie was created in the 19th century under the formal supervision of the pope. The gendarmes were responsible for maintaining the internal order and security of Vatican City. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries they shared jurisdiction with the long-established Swiss Guards (responsible for the personal security of the pope) and the largely ceremonial Palatine Honour Guard (Guardia Palatina d’Onore) and Noble Guard (Guardia Nobile).
The Palatine Honour Guard was formed in 1850 and expanded to include nearly 750 soldiers by 1860. It participated in various military actions of the Papal States outside of the Vatican walls until Rome was occupied by Italian troops in 1870, after which it was drastically reduced in strength. The Noble Guard was created from existing cavalry units in 1744 but reorganized (with some 80 men) and renamed in the early 19th century. Its mounted officers, who were drawn from noble families, provided a papal escort on official and ceremonial occasions. In 1970 Pope Paul VI disbanded the Pontifical Gendarmerie, the Palatine Honour Guard, and the Noble Guard, leaving only the Swiss Guards intact. Responsibility for patrolling the Holy See was subsequently transferred to a private organization, which is now generally referred to as the Vatican City police. By special arrangement, however, St. Peter’s Square falls under the jurisdiction of the Italian police.
