Recognizance,   in Anglo-American law, obligation entered into before a judge or magistrate whereby a party (the recognizor) binds himself to owe a sum of money in the event that he does not perform a stipulated act. If he fails to perform the required act, the money may be collected in an appropriate legal proceeding.
The most common use of the recognizance is in connection with bail in criminal cases. By filing in court a bail bond, a person arrested for a crime may generally secure his release from imprisonment pending his trial or sometimes pending his appeal after conviction. Generally he posts money or property as surety. When no surety is required, the accused is said to be released “on his own recognizance.” See also bail.
In civil litigation the recognizance of a party may be required to ensure the payment of costs (i.e., amounts of money losing parties must pay to winning parties for the expenses of litigation).
