Seventh Amendment,  amendment (1791) to the Constitution of the United States, part of the Bill of Rights, that formally established the rules governing civil trials. The amendment’s objective was to preserve a distinction between the responsibilities of the courts (such as deciding matters of law) and those of juries (such as deciding matters of fact).
Many of the Seventh Amendment’s provisions were rooted in the English common-law tradition, and over time they have experienced only marginal change. While the number of jurors has been reduced from 12 (which was the common-law norm) to 6, and while parties may waive their right to trial by jury in favour of a direct verdict, other distinguishing characteristics of the common-law tradition (such as the unanimous verdict requirement) and the amendment (the financial threshold) remain intact. The Seventh Amendment is an unincorporated right, meaning that it has not been brought under the scope of protection offered to the states under the Fourteenth Amendment’s due process clause.
