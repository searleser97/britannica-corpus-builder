Distress,   in law, process that enables a person to seize and detain from a wrongdoer some chattel, or item of personal property, as a pledge for the redressing of an injury, the performance of a duty, or the satisfaction of a demand. Distress was frequently levied without legal process, but requirements have become more stringent and now often necessitate some type of court action.
Seizure of property was common in ancient societies as a means of obtaining satisfaction for crime, breach of contract, nonpayment of debt, or any other offense or injury. It continues in modern times in nearly all legal systems.
The main causes for which distress is allowed vary from country to country. In general, they include (1) the nonpayment of rent, (2) trespass and damage by cattle or other chattels, (3) nonpayment of taxes and certain fines, and (4) nonpayment for goods and services received.
Initially the right of distress was a mere passive right to detain goods distrained until payment or recompense was made; this right still exists in many places when there has been damage or trespass by cattle. In other cases the power to sell the goods to pay the sum due has been conferred by statute. Certain types of goods are usually exempt from distress: goods in actual use, perishable goods, and the apparel and bedding of a tenant.
Because it affords an opportunity for injustice and discriminates in favour of one particular class of creditors, the distress form of self-help, or seizure of property, has not been favoured in some countries, such as the United States. Where the remedy still remains, it generally has been modified to vest enforcement in a public official and to narrow the right in other ways.
