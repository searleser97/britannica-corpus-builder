Cloture, also called closure,  in parliamentary procedure, a method for ending debate and securing an immediate vote on a measure that is before a deliberative body, even when some members wish to continue the debate. Provision for invoking cloture was made in the British House of Commons in 1882, with the requirement that such a motion could carry only if it received at least 100 affirmative votes.
A cloture’s main purpose is to provide a means to check a filibuster—an endless debate by a minority to keep a motion from being put to a vote. In most parliamentary bodies a cloture motion is not debatable, is not subject to amendment, and requires more than a simple majority vote. For example, in the United States Senate a three-fifths vote is necessary, which then limits debate to an additional 30 hours.
