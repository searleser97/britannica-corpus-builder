Al-Takfīr wa al-Hijrah, (Arabic:  “Excommunication and [Holy] Flight”)  name given by Egyptian authorities to a radical Islamic group calling itself the Society of Muslims. It was founded in 1971 by a young agronomist, Shukrī Muṣṭafā, who had been arrested in 1965 for distributing Muslim Brotherhood leaflets and was released from prison in 1971. Appealing to those who saw mainstream society—from which the group sought to flee (see Hijrah)—as weak, corrupt, and un-Islamic, it engaged in acts of terrorism, including the kidnapping and killing of a high-ranking cleric, a crime for which Shukrī was tried and executed in 1977. Its actions initiated the repression of fundamentalist groups by security services in Egypt in the late 1970s.
