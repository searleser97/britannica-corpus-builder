Continuous voyage,   in international law, a voyage that, in view of its purposes, is regarded as one single voyage though interrupted (as in the transshipment of contraband of war). The doctrine specifically refers to the stoppage and seizure of goods carried by neutral vessels either out of or heading toward a neutral port. If such goods were to be transshipped to another belligerent (the enemy) at some point in the voyage, the state invoking the doctrine could claim that, regardless of the period of neutral possession, the voyage was continuously geared toward trade with the belligerent power.
Perhaps the most famous invocation of the doctrine of continuous voyage occurred during the Napoleonic wars, when American merchants attempted to evade British blockade restrictions by carrying goods from the French West Indies to France via U.S. ports. British courts ruled that such voyages were in fact continuous and were not entitled to be considered neutral commerce.
