Shunning,  social control mechanism used most commonly in small tight-knit social groups to punish those who violate the most serious group rules. It is related to exile and banishment, although shunning is based on social rather than physical isolation or separation. In social groups where a person’s social identity and well-being are closely tied to regular interaction with other group members, shunning can be a very emotionally painful and effective punishment for those who violate group rules.
Shunning is used for only the most serious offenses, and the punishment is usually applied only after a formal judicial procedure. The Old Order Amish, for example, use many lesser punishments, including gossip, lectures by church officials, and public confession for everyday offenses. Shunning is the most-severe punishment and is reserved for the most-serious offenses, such as marrying a non-Amish person, adultery, excessive contact with the outside world, and drunkenness. Shunning is instituted only through a unanimous vote by the church community.
Although societies that practice shunning may apply the punishment for life, it is typically limited to a set period, which is often ended by another formal hearing or by evidence that the person has returned to acting in a socially responsible manner. Shunning may be applied to the individual rule breaker’s family as well, which puts pressure on family members to act to correct the behaviour of the offender. There is little empirical research on the effectiveness of shunning, but it is believed to be effective because it deters repeat behaviour by the offender, deters similar behaviour by others, and marks for the community those behaviours that are considered unacceptable.
