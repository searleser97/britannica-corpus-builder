Schuman Plan,  proposal by French foreign minister Robert Schuman on May 9, 1950, for the creation of a single authority to control the production of steel and coal in France and West Germany (now Germany), to be opened for membership to other European countries. The proposal was realized in the European Coal and Steel Community, and the plan laid the foundations for the 1958 establishment of the European Economic Community.
