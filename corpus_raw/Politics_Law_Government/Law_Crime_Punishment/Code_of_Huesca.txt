Code of Huesca,  most important law code of medieval Aragon, written by Bishop Vidal de Canellas under the Aragonese king James I. It was promulgated in 1247 and takes its name from the city of Huesca in northeastern Spain. The main purpose of the code was to collect and arrange the franchises or laws known as fueros and to delineate the territorial boundaries of Aragon. Originally written in Latin, it filled eight books; as it was translated into the dialect of Aragon, it was expanded, finally totaling 12 volumes. The code served as a civil and criminal legal source until the 15th century.
