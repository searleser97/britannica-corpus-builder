Hypothec,   in Roman law, a type of security for a debt in which the creditor had neither ownership nor possession. It arose in cases in which a renter needed the use of the things that he pledged as security for his continued payment of rent, usually tools or equipment necessary for working the land he was renting. Possession could be taken by the creditor only when the debt, or, in this case, the rent, was not paid.
Modern hypothecs are found in civil-law countries such as France and Germany. They are similar in concept to a mortgage, except that they do not grant title or possession to the creditor. Although applied exclusively in the past to immovables, they may now apply in certain cases to movables. Hypothecs involve real rights but do not include ownership. The creditor may, in last resort, seize the property, regardless of who is holding it; further, he may sell under the authorization of the court. These rights become operative upon nonpayment of the debt.
In France there are three types of hypothecs: contractual, judicial, and legal. Contractual hypothecs are those made between individuals, and they must be notarized before witnesses. It is necessary to state the amount to be secured in the document. Judicial hypothecs are instituted by the court against all the property, present and future, of a debtor. Legal hypothecs are rights given to married women over the property of their husbands, and to children and incapacitated individuals over the property of their guardians. This is to protect them against any mismanagement by the husband or guardian of their own or common property.
