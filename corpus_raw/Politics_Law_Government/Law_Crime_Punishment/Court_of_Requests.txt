Court of Requests,  in England, one of the prerogative courts that grew out of the king’s council (Curia Regis) in the late 15th century. The court’s primary function was to deal with civil petitions from poor people and the king’s servants.
Called the Court of Poor Men’s Causes until 1529, it was a popular court because of the limited expense of bringing suit before it. Modeled after the French Chambre des Requêtes (“Chamber of Petitions”), the Court of Requests was mainly concerned with civil matters (e.g., title to land, covenants, annuities, and debt), though it sometimes handled criminal cases such as forgery and riots. Its procedures were similar to those used in the Court of Chancery, another prerogative court, which administered cases of equity.
The Court of Requests was presided over by the lord privy seal with the assistance, after 1550, of two masters of requests. During the reign of Elizabeth I (1558–1603), the court enlarged its jurisdiction to cover Admiralty cases, which involved mercantile as well as prize conflicts. After 1590 a series of prohibitions from the Court of Common Pleas, a common-law court, reduced the business in the Court of Requests. The Court of Requests, unlike the prerogative courts of the Star Chamber and the High Commission, was not formally abolished in 1641. The masters, however, ceased to sit at that point, and the court itself was used after the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 only for the purposes of assessing compensations due to royalists and examining personal petitions for royal favours. The court did not survive into the 18th century.
The name court of requests was also given to inferior local courts established by special acts of Parliament to deal with small debts. These were abolished in the mid-19th century along with the London Court of Requests.
