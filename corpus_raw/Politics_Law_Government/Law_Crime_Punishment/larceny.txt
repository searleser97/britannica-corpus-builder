Larceny,  in criminal law, the trespassory taking and carrying away of personal goods from the possession of another with intent to steal. Larceny is one of the specific crimes included in the general category of theft.
Historically, the property subject to larceny in common law consisted of tangible personal goods. Modern legislation has expanded the scope of the offense by making larcenable such objects as crops and fixtures attached to the land and documents evidencing legal claims. Larceny requires a trespassory taking; that is, the goods must be taken from the possession of another without consent. The expansion of the larceny offense at common law occurred principally by extending the notion of property in the possession of another. Thus, possession of property entrusted by a master to a servant was regarded as remaining in the master; hence a conversion of such property by the servant was larceny. So also, when a defendant gains control or possession of goods, as distinct from the property in them, by trick or false representations, possession is deemed not to pass to the offender, and a misappropriation by the latter is larceny. When the owner is induced to consent to parting with the property in goods by a false representation, the offense is obtaining goods by false pretenses, or fraud.
The goods must not only be taken but “carried away.” The latter requirement is highly formalistic and is satisfied by any movement of the entire object, however slight. There must, finally, be an intent to steal, which is ordinarily defined as an intent to deprive the owner permanently of the goods. Thus, an unauthorized borrowing of another’s property is not larceny if there was an intent to return the property. Moreover, one who takes goods erroneously believing them to be one’s own does not commit the offense.
