United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, formerly United States Court of Military Appeals,  court created by the Congress of the United States in 1950 as the highest court for military personnel. It hears appeals of cases originally adjudicated in military tribunals, which are presided over by commissioned officers or military judges.
Originally consisting of three civil judges, the court since 1990 has consisted of five judges appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate for 15-year terms. In the late 20th century, Congress enacted legislation that made some of the courtâ€™s decisions subject to review by the U.S. Supreme Court.
