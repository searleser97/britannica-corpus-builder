Sachsenspiegel, (German: “Saxon Mirror”)  the most important of the medieval compilations of Saxon customary law. Collected in the early 13th century by Eike von Repgow (also spelled Repkow, Repchow, or Repgau), a knight and a judge, it was written originally in Latin and later in German and showed little Roman influence, largely because Roman law was still virtually unknown at that time and had not penetrated German law.
The Sachsenspiegel was divided into two sections. The first part, the Landrecht, or territorial law, contained what could now be called constitutional law, criminal law, and civil law and procedure. The second part, the Lehnrecht, comprised feudal regulations.
The Sachsenspiegel was used by many towns as the model for their constitutions and codes. Magdeburg’s, known as the Magdeburger Recht, was copied throughout Germany and eastern Europe. Although some of its provisions were assailed by theologians in the 14th century, its influence was felt in German territories for more than 300 years, until the reception of Roman law in the 16th century. Its imprint could even be seen in the introduction of the German Civil Code at the turn of the 20th century.
