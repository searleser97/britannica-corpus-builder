Irish system,  penal method originated in the early 1850s by Sir Walter Crofton. Modeled after Alexander Maconochie’s mark system, it emphasized training and performance as the instruments of reform. The Irish system consisted of three phases: a period of solitary confinement; a period of congregate work, in which the prisoner advanced to higher levels by credits, or “marks,” earned for industry and good behaviour; and, finally, a period in “intermediate prisons” with minimal supervision, during which the prisoner demonstrated his dependability and employability in the outside world. Release was conditional upon the continued good conduct of the offender, who could be returned to prison if it seemed advisable. Prisoners deemed eligible for release were issued “tickets of leave” and put under the supervision of an inspector who verified employment status and conducted periodic visits to their new places of residence. With its emphasis on conditional release and its use of tickets of leave, the Irish system influenced the development of parole.
