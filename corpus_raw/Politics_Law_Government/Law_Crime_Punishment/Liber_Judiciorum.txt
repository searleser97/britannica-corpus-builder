Liber Judiciorum, Castilian Fuero Juzgo, English Book of Laws,  Visigothic law code that formed the basis of medieval Spanish law. It was promulgated in 654 by King Recceswinth and was revised in 681 and 693. Although called Visigothic, the code was in Latin and owed much to Roman tradition.
The primary innovation of the code was the designation of territorial laws. Of the 500 laws in the code, many were revisions of those dating from the time of King Leovigild (d. 586). They dealt with 12 areas: laws and legal administrators; courts; matrimony; families and inheritances; contracts; crimes and the use of torture; robbery; crime against property; the right of asylum (especially with reference to deserters from military service); the draft and division of landed estates; laws governing doctors and merchants; and laws for the punishment of heretics, public officials, and Jews.
The main contemporary value of the code is its detailed picture of the constitutional organization of the Visigothic kingdom and the information it provides about the “vulgar law”—i.e., Roman law adapted to fit the economic and social conditions of the late Roman Empire. The code continued to be used by the Christian judges of Muslim Spain, and it benefited from the renewed prestige of the Visigothic tradition that emerged during the Christian Reconquista.
