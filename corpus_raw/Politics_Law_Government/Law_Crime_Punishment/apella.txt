Apella,   ancient Spartan assembly, corresponding to the ekklÄ“sia of other Greek states. Its monthly meetings, probably restricted to full citizens over 30, were presided over at first by the kings, later by ephors (magistrates). Not empowered to initiate proposals, the body considered subjects forwarded by the ephors or gerousia (council of elders). Only kings, elders, ephors, and perhaps other magistrates could debate, and voting was conducted by shouts. Foreign policy, including treaties and issues of peace and war, as well as questions of succession to the throne, were within the province of the apella. It also appointed military commanders, elected the elders and ephors, and voted on proposed changes in the laws.
