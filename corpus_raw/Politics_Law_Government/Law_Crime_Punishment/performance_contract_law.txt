Performance,   in law, act of doing that which is required by a contract. The effect of successful performance is to discharge the person bound to do the act from any future contractual liability.
Each party to the contract is bound to perform promises according to the stipulated terms. In case of any controversy as to the meaning of a promise, the courts have usually decided that a person must perform it as the other party reasonably understood it to be. Thus, a preference for the rights of the one who is to receive the benefit of the promise is established.
Attempts to establish hard and fast rules about reasonable interpretations of promises are now discouraged. Although at one time a person would be held to the literal meaning of the contract provisions stating a promise, the requirement now is to perform the true meaning and intent of the contract, which may not correspond with the fine print.
