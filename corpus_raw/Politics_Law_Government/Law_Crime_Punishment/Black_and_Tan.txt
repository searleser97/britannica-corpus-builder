Black and Tan,  name given to British recruits enrolled in the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) from January 1920 to July 1921. Their colloquial name derived from the makeshift uniforms they were issued because of a shortage of RIC uniforms—green police tunics and khaki military trousers, which together resembled the distinctive markings of a famous pack of Limerick foxhounds. When Irish republican agitation intensified after World War I, a large proportion of the Irish police resigned. They were replaced by these temporary English recruits—mostly jobless former soldiers—who were paid 10 shillings a day.
In seeking to counter the terrorism of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), the Black and Tans themselves engaged in brutal reprisals. Notably, on “Bloody Sunday,” Nov. 21, 1920, the IRA killed 11 Englishmen suspected of being intelligence agents. The Black and Tans took revenge the same afternoon, attacking spectators at a Gaelic football match in Croke Park, Dublin, killing 12 and wounding 60. The RIC was disbanded in 1922 after the Anglo-Irish Treaty of December 1921.
