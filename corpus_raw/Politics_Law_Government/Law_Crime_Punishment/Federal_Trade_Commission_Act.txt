Federal Trade Commission Act (FTCA),  federal legislation that was adopted in the United States in 1914 to create the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and to give the U.S. government a full complement of legal tools to use against anticompetitive, unfair, and deceptive practices in the marketplace. The act was thus designed to achieve two related goals: fair competition between businesses and protection of consumers against fraudulent business practices. To those ends, the act empowered the FTC to enforce provisions of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 and the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, and it specifically barred the use of deceptive or false advertising. The act has been amended numerous times over the course of more than a century to expand the FTCâ€™s authority and to adapt its mission to new industries.
Unlike the Sherman and Clayton acts, the FTCA allows an accused party to enter into a consent agreement with the FTC in which the party does not admit guilt but agrees never to engage in the questionable behaviour in the future. The FTCA also gives the FTC the power to issue cease-and-desist orders, which are enforceable by petition to a U.S. appellate court. Failure by a defendant party to act in accordance with the consent decree or cease-and-desist order can result in a finding of contempt and criminal referral to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), among other actions. In some circumstances, the FTC may make a criminal referral to the DOJ without first engaging in a regulatory action or may bring a civil suit against the defendant party. This may occur if the FTC believes that the behaviour is so grievous as not to warrant regulatory action or if the defendant party chooses to not cooperate with the FTC.
