Scutage, also called shield money, French écuage,  (scutage from Latin scutum, “shield”), in feudal law, payment made by a knight to commute the military service that he owed his lord. A lord might accept from his vassal a sum of money (or something else of value, often a horse) in lieu of service on some expedition. The system was advantageous to both sides and grew rapidly with the expansion of money economy in Europe in the 12th and 13th centuries.
Scutage existed in various countries, including France and Germany, but was most highly developed in England, where it was first mentioned in 1100. It seems to have been levied, at first, on ecclesiastical tenants in chief, who had difficulty in finding their full quota of knights for the king’s army. It soon became a general tax on knights’ estates, and by the 13th century the rates were standardized.
Though the crown could demand scutage, tenants could not refuse to perform military service if required to do so. From the time of Richard I (1189–99), however, special fines (payments larger than the routine scutage) were accepted from tenants in chief in lieu of service on a particular campaign. As a result of the frequent and heavy scutages exacted by King John, Magna Carta (1215) forbade the levy of scutage without the consent of a great council. During the 13th century, scutages and fines continued, the latter becoming more general. Scutage, collected from mesne (intermediate) tenants who had not attended a campaign, was divided between the king and those tenants in chief who had served in person. By the 14th century, however, scutage had become obsolete.
