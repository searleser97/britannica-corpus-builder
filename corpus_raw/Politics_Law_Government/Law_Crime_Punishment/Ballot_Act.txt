Ballot Act,  (1872) British law that introduced the secret ballot for all parliamentary and municipal elections. The secret ballot was also called the Australian ballot, because it was first used in Australian elections (1856). The British law, which was designed to protect voters from bribery and coercion, was one of the important achievements of William E. Gladstoneâ€™s first administration.
