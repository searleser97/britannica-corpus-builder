Disorderly conduct,   in law, intentional disturbing of the public peace and order by language or other conduct. It is a general term including various offenses that are usually punishable by minor penalties.
Disorderly conduct may take the form of directly disturbing the peace, as when one intentionally disrupts a public meeting or awakens a sleeping community. Less directly, it includes fighting in a public place, although it does not apply to one who defends himself on being attacked. Most jurisdictions penalize displays of public drunkenness. Some maintain vagrancy statutes that penalize persons found to be idle and without visible means of support. These may include prostitutes, beggars, gamblers, or alcoholics.
