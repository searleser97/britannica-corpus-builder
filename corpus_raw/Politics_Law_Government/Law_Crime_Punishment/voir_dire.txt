Voir dire,  in law, process of questioning by which members of a jury are selected from a large panel, or venire, of prospective jurors. The veniremen are questioned by the judge or by the attorneys for the respective parties. The voir dire attempts to detect bias or preconceived notions of guilt or innocence on the part of the veniremen. The parties, including the prosecution in a criminal case, may challenge potential jurors and dismiss an unlimited number for cause. They also have a limited number of peremptory challenges, which enable them to dismiss a juror without giving a reason.
