Trespass,   in law, the unauthorized entry upon land. Initially, trespass was wrongful conduct directly causing injury or loss and thus was the origin of the law of torts in common-law countries. Trespass now, however, is generally confined to issues involving real property.
Neither malice nor knowledgeability is essential to trespass. Thus, mistaken belief as to ownership of land is no defense to a trespass charge. Moreover, possession—not ownership—is the issue in trespass to land. A trespass suit can be brought by anyone in possession of land—even wrongful possession.
Formerly, every unauthorized entry was trespass, even if no loss resulted. The courts have softened this policy, but vestiges of it remain. Once a trespass is proved, the trespasser is usually held liable for any damages resulting—regardless of whether he was negligent or whether the damage was foreseeable. Similarly, if a man fells a tree on his land even with complete caution, if the tree falls onto his neighbour’s land, he is held strictly liable for damage.
Trespass to land is also unauthorized subsurface entry (e.g., horizontal drilling) and in the air (e.g., stringing telephone wires), although air rights are still very much in controversy. If there is a continuing presence (e.g., dumping trash on land), the trespass continues until removed.
Trespass can also be against personal property, but in such cases the object must be carried away and actual damage must be shown—in contrast to technical trespasses against land.
Trespass in criminal law is a trespass accomplished through the intentional demonstration of force calculated to intimidate or alarm the owner or accomplished in such a way as to tend toward a breach of the peace. No trespass is criminal unless it tends to a breach of the peace, even though the act be committed forcefully and maliciously.
