Debenture stock,   loan contract issued by a company or public body specifying an obligation to return borrowed funds and pay interest, secured by all or part of the companyâ€™s property. Certificates specifying the amount of stock, with coupons for interest attached, are usually issued to the lenders. The interests of the stockholders may be protected by a trust deed naming a trustee who acts on behalf of the stockholders and against whom they actually have claim. In case of default, the debenture holder may appoint a receiver to seize and realize assets and repay the money secured. Compare bond.
