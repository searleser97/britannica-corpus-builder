Centumviri,   in ancient Rome, court of civil jurisdiction that gained distinction for its hearing of inheritance claims, through which it influenced succession. The court, instituted in c. 150 bc, was composed of three men from each tribe, a total of 105 judges; hence, the name centumviri (“100 men”), which remained unaltered even when the number increased to 180 by the time of Trajan. It disappeared in the 3rd century ad.
