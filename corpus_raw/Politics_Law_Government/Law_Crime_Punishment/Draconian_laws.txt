Draconian laws,  traditional Athenian law code allegedly introduced by Draco c. 621 bce. Aristotle, the chief source for knowledge of Draco, claims that his were the first written Athenian laws and that Draco established a constitution enfranchising hoplites, the lower class soldiers. The Draconian laws were most noteworthy for their harshness; they were said to be written in blood, rather than ink. Death was prescribed for almost all criminal offenses. Solon, who was the archon (magistrate) in 594 bce, later repealed Draco’s code and published new laws, retaining only Draco’s homicide statutes. Modern scholarship tends to be skeptical of the Draconian tradition. The hoplite constitution was certainly a later invention. Little is known of the laws, but even the homicide laws probably underwent change by the 4th century bce.
