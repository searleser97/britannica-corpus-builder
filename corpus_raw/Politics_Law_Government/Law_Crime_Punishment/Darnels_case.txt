Darnel’s case, (1627–28), also called Five Knights’ case,  celebrated case in the history of the liberty of English subjects. It contributed to the enactment of the Petition of Right. In March 1627, Sir Thomas Darnel—together with four other knights, Sir John Corbet, Sir Walter Earl, Sir Edmund Hampden, and Sir John Hevingham—was arrested by the order of King Charles I for refusing to contribute to forced loans. The knights demanded that the crown show cause for their imprisonment or that they be released on bail. In November 1627 their appeal for a writ of habeas corpus was argued before the King’s Bench. Counsel for the knights appealed mostly to medieval precedents, including clause 39 of the Magna Carta, which stipulated that no man should lose his liberty without due process of law. On Tudor precedents the crown argued that it had a large discretionary power of arrest. The judges refused bail but did not decide that the crown could always commit without cause. After the release of the knights in 1628, the issue continued to be debated in Parliament. Charles I’s agreement not to imprison subjects who refused to pay forced loans did not mollify a House of Commons that sought to impose on the reluctant monarch its own interpretation of the Magna Carta. From this impasse was born the Petition of Right (1628).
