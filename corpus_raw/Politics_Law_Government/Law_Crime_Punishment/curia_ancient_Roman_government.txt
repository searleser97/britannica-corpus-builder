Curia, plural Curiae,   in ancient Rome, a political division of the people. According to tradition Romulus, the city’s founder, divided the people into 3 tribes and 30 curiae, each of which in turn was composed of 10 families (gentes). They were the units that made up the primitive assembly of the people, the Comitia Curiata, and were the basis of early Roman military organization. Under the early republic (5th–4th century bc), the curiae gradually lost their political and military importance and functioned mainly as religious bodies, headed by an official called a curio.
“Curia” also designated the meeting place for such a group and came to be applied to other meeting places (including the Senate building) and to other kinds of assemblies.
