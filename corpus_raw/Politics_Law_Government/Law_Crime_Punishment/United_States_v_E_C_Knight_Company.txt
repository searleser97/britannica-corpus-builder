United States v. E.C. Knight Company, byname Sugar Trust Case,   (1895), legal case in which the U.S. Supreme Court first interpreted the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890. The case began when the E.C. Knight Company gained control of the American Sugar Refining Company. By 1892 American Sugar enjoyed a virtual monopoly of sugar refining in the United States, controlling 98 percent of the industry.
President Grover Cleveland ordered the government to sue the Knight Company under the provisions of the Sherman Act, and the case reached the Supreme Court in 1895. The court ruled 8 to 1 against the government, declaring that manufacturing (i.e., refining) was a local activity not subject to congressional regulation of interstate commerce.
The decision, permitting combinations of manufacturers, put most monopolies beyond the reach of the Sherman Antitrust Act. Not until serious trust-busting began under presidents Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft were teeth put into the antitrust laws and the power of monopolies somewhat curtailed.
