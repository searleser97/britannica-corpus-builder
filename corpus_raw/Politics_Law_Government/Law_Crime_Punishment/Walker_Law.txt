Walker Law,   (1920), first significant U.S. legislation concerning the sport of boxing, enacted in the state of New York under the sponsorship of James J. Walker, speaker of the state senate. The bill legalized professional boxing in New York, and its code of boxing rules, for the most part written by William Gavin, an English boxing promoter, provided a basis for similar legislation in other states. The law also established the New York State Athletic Commission, which has remained independent and continues to publish its own list of world boxing champions.
