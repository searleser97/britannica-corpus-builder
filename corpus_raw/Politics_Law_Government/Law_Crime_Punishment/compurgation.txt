Compurgation, also called Wager Of Law,  in early English law, method of settling issues of fact by appeal to a type of character witness. Compurgation was practiced until the 16th century in criminal matters and into the 19th century in civil matters.
The essence of the procedure lay in oath making. The party responsible for proving a fact had to produce a number of witnesses (usually 12) who would swear that he was telling the truth; they did not testify about the fact itself and, indeed, might have no personal knowledge concerning it. The value of a manâ€™s oath might vary with his status; sometimes it was necessary for a defendant to meet a charge by assembling oaths of a prescribed monetary value. Because oath making often had religious implications for those who served as oath helpers and because there was also a possibility of legal sanctions, individuals might refuse to give oaths for persons with bad reputations. One reason for the long survival of the practice was that compurgations were often considered better evidence than account books in cases of debt.
