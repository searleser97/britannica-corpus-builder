Diploma Leopoldinum, (English: “Leopold’s Diploma”)  decree issued in October 1690 by Leopold I, Holy Roman emperor and king of Hungary (1658–1705), after the Ottoman Turks had been driven from central Hungary in 1686. The decree established the political status and the freedoms of Transylvania, notably the freedom of observance for its four religions: Catholicism, Lutheranism, Calvinism, and Unitarianism.
Until the defeat of the Turks, Transylvania (now northwestern Romania) had been virtually an independent state, under largely nominal Turkish suzerainty and ruled by elected Hungarian princes. The Diploma, which enshrined the agreement between the Habsburg emperor and the Transylvanian nobles, ensured the continuation of the autonomy of the province. It provided for a governor (to rule until the prince of Transylvania reached maturity) chosen by the estates from the so-called three nations (Hungarians, Szeklers, and Saxons) and endorsed by the emperor. The Diploma also adjusted the level of taxation and guaranteed free trade. The army was to be under the command of a general nominated by the emperor but who did not have a voice in public affairs.
Introduced after years of anarchy and war, the Diploma offered the promise of internal order and cultural and vocational opportunities for all three nations of Transylvania in their own languages. It soon became apparent, however, that the Diploma had not secured autonomy for Transylvania, as the leadership of the principality came under the direct influence of the Vienna chancellery. Transylvania was therefore severed from Hungary for the next two centuries.
