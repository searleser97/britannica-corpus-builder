Treasury note,  government security, usually marketable, with maturity ranging from one to five years. Because their relatively shorter maturities make them a more liquid investment than long-term securities, notes have the advantage of lower interest costs. The maturities and terms of notes can be adjusted to the requirements of various investors. Treasury notes are held as secondary reserves by commercial banks.
