Knesset, (Hebrew: “Assembly”)  unicameral parliament of Israel and supreme authority of that state. On Feb. 16, 1949, the Constituent Assembly—elected in January of that year to prepare the country’s constitution—ratified the Transition Law and reconstituted itself as the First Knesset. On the same day, Chaim Weizmann (1874–1952) was elected the first president of Israel. Many of its procedural rules (takkanoth) are similar to those of the British House of Commons. Israel did not adopt a formal, written constitution, but it later enacted basic laws on the Knesset (1958); on Israeli lands (1960); on the president (1964), who is elected by the Knesset for a five-year term and is eligible for reelection only once; and on government (1968).
The 120-member Knesset is elected every four years under a system that provides for proportional representation for even quite small political parties. Voters (age 18 or older) choose among national lists of candidates (21 or older) offered by political parties and groups. (The whole nation is a single constituency; there are no districts.) If a party’s list, for example, receives 5 percent of the vote, the first six persons (5 percent of 120) on that list become members of the Knesset. The parties determine the order of names on their lists. Since it is difficult for a single party to win a majority of the seats, government by coalition is common in Israel.
The prime minister-elect names the cabinet, the main policy-making body. Its existence is subject to a vote of confidence in the Knesset. Cabinet members are normally members of the Knesset, though nonmembers may be named. Bills approved as law are published in one series of Reshumot (“The Official Gazette: The Book of Laws”), while pending bills are published in two other series.
