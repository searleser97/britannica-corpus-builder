Pocket veto,  the killing of legislation by a chief executive through a failure to act within a specified period following the adjournment of the legislature. In the United States, if the president does not sign a bill within 10 days of its passage by Congress, it automatically becomes law. However, if Congress adjourns within the 10-day period and the president does not sign the bill, it is automatically vetoed, and the veto is absolute. The latter action is referred to as a pocket veto.
