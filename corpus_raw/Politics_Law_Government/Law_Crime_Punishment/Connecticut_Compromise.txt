Connecticut Compromise, also known as Great Compromise,  in United States history, the compromise offered by Connecticut delegates Roger Sherman and Oliver Ellsworth during the drafting of the Constitution of the United States at the 1787 convention to solve the dispute between small and large states over representation in the new federal government. The compromise provided for a bicameral federal legislature that used a dual system of representation: the upper house would have equal representation from each state, while the lower house would have proportional representation based on a state’s population.
In 1787 the convention met in the Pennsylvania State House in Philadelphia, ostensibly to amend the Articles of Confederation (the first U.S. constitution, 1781–89). The idea of amending the Articles was discarded, though, and the assembly set about drawing up a new scheme of government. One area of disagreement between delegates from small states and those from large states was the apportionment of representation in the federal government. Edmund Randolph offered a plan known as the Virginia, or large state, plan, which provided for a bicameral legislature with representation of each state based on its population or wealth. William Paterson proposed the New Jersey, or small state, plan, which provided for equal representation in Congress. Neither the large nor the small states would yield. Ellsworth and Sherman, among others, proposed a bicameral legislature with proportional representation in the lower house (the House of Representatives) and equal representation of the states in the upper house (the Senate). All revenue measures would originate in the lower house. That compromise was approved July 16, 1787.
