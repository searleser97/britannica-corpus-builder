Duoviri, also spelled Duumviri, singular Duovir, or Duumvir,  in ancient Rome, a magistracy of two men. Duoviri perduellionis were two judges, selected by the chief magistrate, who tried cases of crime against the state. Duoviri navales, at first appointed but later popularly elected (311â€“178 bc), had charge of a fleet. The two chief magistrates of the colonies and municipia (i.e., communities under Roman domination) were often called duoviri jure dicundo.
