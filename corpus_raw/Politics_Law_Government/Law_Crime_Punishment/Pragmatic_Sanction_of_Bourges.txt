Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges,  (July 7, 1438), decree issued by King Charles VII of France after an assembly had examined the decrees of the Council of Basel (see Basel, Council of). It approved the decree Sacrosancta of the council, which asserted the supremacy of a council over the pope, and established the “liberties” of the Gallican Church, restricting the rights of the pope and in many cases making his jurisdiction subject to the will of the king. Revoked by Louis XI in 1461 but reasserted from time to time, the Pragmatic Sanction was ultimately superseded by the Concordat of Bologna, negotiated by Francis I and Pope Leo X in 1516.
