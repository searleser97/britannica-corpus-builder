Solicitation,   in criminal law, the request, encouragement, or direction of one person by another to commit a serious criminal offense. It is frequently linked with the crime of incitement. An inciter is generally one who is present at the scene of the offense and who encourages the principal offender to commit an act that he is already inclined to commit on his own. A solicitor need not be present at the scene but is responsible for procuring and directing the act itself. Solicitation is a crime in itself regardless of whether the act solicited is eventually committed. Incitement is frequently punished only with regard to an act that is committed.
Solicitation is a step toward the commission of a crime. If the person solicited is not legally liable, as in the case of a child, the solicitor may be guilty of an attempt to solicit. If the solicited party accomplishes the contemplated act, the solicitor may be punished as an accessory. See also accomplice.
