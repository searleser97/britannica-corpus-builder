Bill of lading,  document executed by a carrier, such as a railroad or shipping line, acknowledging receipt of goods and embodying an agreement to transport the goods to a stated destination. Bills of lading are closely related to warehouse receipts, which contain an agreement for storage rather than carriage. Both may be negotiable when they provide that the goods are to be delivered not to a fixed individual but, typically, to the order of a stated person; this person may endorse the document and give it to another, who will then be entitled to receive the goods. Such a negotiable document of title, which calls for the delivery of goods, must be distinguished from negotiable commercial paper such as notes and bills of exchange, which call for the payment of money. See also charter party.
