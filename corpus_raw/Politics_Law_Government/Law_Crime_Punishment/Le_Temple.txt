Le Temple,  in Paris, originally a fortified monastery of the Templars and later a royal prison. It was built in the 12th century northeast of the city in an area commanded by the Templars; the area is now the Temple quarter of Paris (3rd arrondissement).
By the 13th century the Temple, especially its keeps, or towers, was being used to store the treasures not only of the Templars but also of the king of France. After the collapse of the order in the 14th century, the towers served primarily as a royal prison, for both criminals and debtors. In the vast complex there were also living quarters for artisans.
On Aug. 10, 1792, revolutionary militants attacked the Tuileries and forced the removal of Louis XVI, Marie-Antoinette, and their family to the petite tour (“little tower”) of the old Temple, later to the main tower, as prisoners of the Paris Commune. There they remained until they were individually tried and guillotined over the following year. Other important persons were incarcerated there until the buildings were demolished in 1811.
