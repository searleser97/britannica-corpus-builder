Sixteenth Amendment,  amendment (1913) to the Constitution of the United States permitting a federal income tax.
Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution empowers Congress to “lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States; but all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States.” Article I, Section 9, further states that “No Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in Proportion to the Census or Enumeration herein before directed to be taken.”
Although income taxes levied in support of the American Civil War (1861–65) were generally tolerated, subsequent attempts by Congress to impose taxes on income were met with significant opposition. In 1895, in Pollock v. Farmers’ Loan and Trust Company, the U.S. Supreme Court declared the federal income tax unconstitutional in striking down portions of the Wilson-Gorman Tariff Act of 1894 that imposed a direct tax on the incomes of American citizens and corporations. It thusly made any direct tax subject to the rules articulated in Article I, Section 2.
Consequently, unless the U.S. Congress expected all income taxes to be apportioned among the states according to their populations, the power to levy income taxes was rendered impotent. The Sixteenth Amendment was introduced in 1909 to remedy this problem. By specifically affixing the language, “from whatever source derived,” it removes the “direct tax dilemma” related to Article I, Section 8, and authorizes Congress to lay and collect income tax without regard to the rules of Article I, Section 9, regarding census and enumeration. It was ratified in 1913.
