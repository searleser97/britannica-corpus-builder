Copyright Act of 1790,  law enacted in 1790 by the U.S. Congress to establish rules of copyright for intellectual works created by citizens and legal residents of the United States. The first such federal law, it was formally titled “An Act for the Encouragement of Learning, by securing the Copies of Maps, Charts, and Books, to the Authors and Proprietors of such Copies, during the Times therein mentioned.” The law guaranteed to authors (or their executors, administrators, or assigns) “the sole right and liberty of printing, reprinting, publishing, and vending” their works for a once-renewable term of 14 years. To secure the copyright of a work, an author was required, among other things, to provide a copy to the clerk of the local district court and to send another copy within six months of the work’s publication to the U.S. secretary of state. Persons convicted of violating another’s copyright were subject to a fine of 50 cents per printed page of copyrighted material in their possession. The first copyright under the law was granted within two weeks of the law’s enactment. The law was first revised in 1831, when the initial copyright term was extended to 28 years. In 1870 administration of copyright registrations was moved from the district courts to the Library of Congress.
