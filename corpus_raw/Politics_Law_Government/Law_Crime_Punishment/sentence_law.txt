Sentence,   in law, formal judgment of a convicted defendant in a criminal case setting the punishment to be meted out. In civil cases the terms decision, award, and judgment are used.
Various types of sentences can be given. In cumulative sentences a defendant convicted on several counts receives a separate sentence for each count; such sentences may run concurrently or consecutively. A sentence may also be for an unspecified period, with the intention of allowing the prisoner to be released on good behaviour at an earlier time than would be possible under a specific sentence. A sentence may also stipulate the conditions under which the prisoner is to be released when he has served his time; for example, he may be released on probation or be discharged absolutely or conditionally.
