Bell Trade Act, formally Philippine Trade Act of 1946,  an act passed by the U.S. Congress specifying the economic conditions governing the emergence of the Republic of the Philippines from U.S. rule; the act included controversial provisions that tied the Philippine economy to that of the United States.
When the Philippines became independent on July 4, 1946, its economy had been thoroughly devastated by World War II. Payment of war damage claims by the U.S. government and an influx of capital were both desperately needed. The Bell Act set quotas on Philippine exports to the U.S., pegged the Philippine peso to the U.S. dollar at a rate of 2:1, and provided for free trade between the two countries for 8 years, to be followed by gradual application of tariffs for the next 20 years. Many Filipinos objected to the so-called Parity Amendment, which required an amendment to the Philippine constitution allowing U.S. citizens equal rights with Filipinos in the exploitation of natural resources and operation of public utilities; nonetheless, some powerful Filipinos involved in these negotiations stood to benefit from the arrangement.
A strong incentive for Philippine acquiescence was the fact that American payment of $800,000,000 in war damage claims was made contingent upon Filipino ratification of the Bell Act. The act remained extremely unpopular in the Philippines. It was later superseded by an agreement more favourable to Filipino interests, the Laurel-Langley Agreement, which took effect in 1956.
