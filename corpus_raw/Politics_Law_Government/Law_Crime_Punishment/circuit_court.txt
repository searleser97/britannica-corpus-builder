Circuit court,  one of many titles for judicial tribunals, usually applied to trial courts of general jurisdiction but occasionally, as with the United States Court of Appeals, to intermediate appellate courts. The title originally referred to a court that made a circuit traveling through the geographic area assigned to it.
