 The Constitution of the United States, which entered into force in 1789, is the oldest written national constitution in use. The framers of the U.S. Constitution included a provision whereby the document may be amended, generally (though not solely) by a two-thirds majority of each house of Congress followed by ratification by legislatures in three-fourths of the states. (Only one amendment, the Twenty-first Amendment, repealing Prohibition, was ratified in an alternate wayâ€”by ratifying conventions in three-fourths of the states.) Since 1789 the Constitution has been amended 27 times; of those amendments, the first 10 are collectively known as the Bill of Rights and were certified on December 15, 1791.
