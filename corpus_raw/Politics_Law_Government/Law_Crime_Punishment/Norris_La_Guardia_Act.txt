Norris–La Guardia Act,  legislative act passed in 1932 that removed certain legal and judicial barriers against the activities of organized labour in the United States. The act declared that the members of labour unions should have “full freedom of association” undisturbed by employers. The act also barred the federal courts from issuing injunctions to prevent strikes, picketing, or boycotts by labour groups and prohibited “yellow-dog” contracts. Previously, employers could, as a condition of employment, require employees to sign an agreement pledging that they would not join a union. If the workers did join a union after signing such a document, they were fired.
The Norris–La Guardia Act was cosponsored in Congress by George Norris and Fiorello La Guardia. It was passed during the depths of the Great Depression, when public opinion had shifted both against employers who sought to prevent workers from joining unions and against judges who used the power of the courts to limit normal union activities. The act was a precursor to the more sweeping Wagner Act of 1935.
