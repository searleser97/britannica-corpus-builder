Ejectment,   in Anglo-American property law, legal action for recovery of land from one wrongfully in possession and monetary compensation for his unlawful detention of the land.
The action, traceable to the Roman law, had its early development in feudal England. By the second half of the 16th century, ejectment was in common use to adjudicate title to any real property. In its technical operation it was highly fictitious, primarily because it was a personal action and not a real action and could be maintained only to right a wrong done to the person. The action of ejectment was preferred against the various forms of real action because of legal complexities that left many landowners either without a remedy or at the mercy of hairline technical procedures in pleading and proof. Thus landowners who wanted to establish their rightful titles would often use fictitious tenants to maintain the ejectment action; because a determination of the legal validity of the landlord’s title was necessary to establish a tenant’s right to possession, the important outcome of the action, in many cases, was the court’s recognition of the landlord’s lawful title.
As a form of action, ejectment fell into disuse in England as a result of the Common Law Procedure Act of 1852. In the United States, ejectment had become part of the law of the colonies but was early reformed to abolish the technical fictions attending the law, thereby making it a title action that could be used directly by any landowner. Today there are ejectment statutes in most U.S. states.
