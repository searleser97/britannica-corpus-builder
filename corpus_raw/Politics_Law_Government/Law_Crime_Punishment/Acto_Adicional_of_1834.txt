Acto Adicional of 1834,   amendment to the Brazilian constitution of 1824 that abolished some of that charter’s extremely centralist and authoritarian aspects. It was enacted as a concession to federalists and republicans who threatened to sunder the nation.
The abdication of the unpopular Brazilian emperor Pedro I in 1831 precipitated the surfacing of violently opposed factions and civil wars—in Pará in 1831, in Minas Gerais in 1833, and in Maranhão and Mato Grosso in 1834. The constitution, which on the whole remained in effect until the inception of the First Republic in 1889, had been drawn up by a council of state appointed by Pedro I. The extensive powers it gave to the emperor, referred to as the poder moderador (“mediative power”), included the appointment of the members of the upper house of Parliament for life from lists of nominees prepared by special electors; the convening and dissolving of the lower house of Parliament, composed of popularly elected representatives; and the right to veto parliamentary acts, although a veto could be overridden if Parliament repassed the measure in three consecutive sessions. Moreover, the popularly elected provincial and municipal assemblies were dominated by imperially appointed presidents.
The Acto Adicional eliminated the reactionary Council of State. It also replaced a three-member regency, which had been instituted for the minority (1831–40) of Pedro II, with a single regent, to make the government more efficient. The amendment also created provincial legislatures, allowed for provincial control over primary and secondary education, and ended the entailing of estates.
Opposition to the central government continued, however, even after the reform: slaves in Bahia revolted in 1835, Maranhão broke out in revolts once again, and a 10-year revolt in Rio Grande do Sul, called the Guerra dos Farrapos (“War of the Ragged Ones”), began in 1835.
