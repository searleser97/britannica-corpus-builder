Extenuating circumstance,   circumstance that diminishes the culpability of one who has committed a criminal offense and so can be considered to mitigate the punishment.
Many Anglo-American legal systems do not prescribe minimum punishments for all crimes. The judge is thus free to consider all the circumstances in setting the punishment up to a prescribed maximum. Some special circumstances automatically reduce an offense to one of lesser degree; for example, provocation of the accused by the victim reduces first-degree murder to manslaughter or second-degree murder. In England, the jury may reduce a charge of murder to manslaughter if the accused is found to be suffering diminished responsibility (distinguished from insanity, which permits acquittal).
Civil-law countries make much more use of prescribed minimum sentences for crime and consequently have had to develop more formal doctrines of extenuating circumstances. The Italian penal code gives a list of extenuating circumstances, such as that the accused acted from motives of honour, that he committed the offense in a state of intense emotion caused by grave misfortune, or that before the trial he repaired the injury by giving compensation. The French and Japanese penal codes provide for reduction of punishment according to a prescribed scale when the jury or court finds extenuating circumstances.
