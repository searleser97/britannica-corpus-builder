Piepoudre court, piepoudre also spelled Piepowder,  lowest and most expeditious of the courts of justice known to the ancient common law of England. It was generally constituted by merchants and dealt with fair trading. The name is derived from the dusty feet of the participants (from French pied poudré, “dusty foot”), for the courts were often held outdoors.
The court decided summarily and on the spot disputes arising in fairs and markets. Its civil jurisdiction extended to all matters of contract arising within the district of the fair or market. These cases were mostly trade disputes; hence, the decisions were based upon the law as it was interpreted by the local merchants (see law merchant). Its criminal jurisdiction extended to all offenses committed at the particular fair where the court was held.
