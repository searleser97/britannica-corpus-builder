Handcuffs,   device for shackling the hands, used by police on prisoners under arrest. Until modern times, handcuffs were of two kinds: (1) the figure 8, which confined the hands close together either in front of or behind the body, and (2) rings that fitted around the wrists and were connected by a short chain, these being somewhat like those used by modern police forces. The old names were manacles; shackbolts, or shackles; gyves; and swivels. Most modern handcuffs are made of steel, adjustable to the wrist size, and equipped with an automatic locking device. Disposable handcuffs of nylon are now available; their advantage is that a police officer can easily carry several pairs, for example, at the scene of a riot.
