American Bar Association  (ABA),   voluntary association of American lawyers and judges. The ABA was founded in 1878, and by the late 20th century it had about 375,000 members. Its headquarters are in Chicago, Ill.
Nongovernmental in nature, the ABA seeks to encourage improvements in the legal profession, to ensure the availability of legal services to all citizens, and to improve the administration of justice. It conducts educational and research projects toward these ends. The ABA’s work is principally carried out by a number of sections and standing and special committees, each of which is devoted to a special field of practice or to subjects of special concern to the bar and the public. The various sections and committees debate and research legal and professional questions and then submit the resolutions they have adopted to the ABA’s governing bodies, the House of Delegates and the Board of Governors, which then act upon them. The ABA publishes the American Bar Association Journal monthly.
