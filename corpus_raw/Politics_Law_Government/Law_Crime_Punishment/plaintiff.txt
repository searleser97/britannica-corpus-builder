Plaintiff,  the party who brings a legal action or in whose name it is broughtâ€”as opposed to the defendant, the party who is being sued. The term corresponds to petitioner in equity and civil law and to libelant in admiralty. It is generally applied also to the equity petitioner, particularly in those jurisdictions in which law and equity are merged. The party who sues out a writ of error to review a judgment or other proceeding at law is often denominated the plaintiff in error, irrespective of whether the party was the plaintiff or the defendant in the lower court proceedings.
