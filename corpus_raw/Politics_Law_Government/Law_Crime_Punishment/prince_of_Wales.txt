Prince of Wales,  title reserved exclusively for the heir apparent to the British throne. It dates from 1301, when King Edward I, after his conquest of Wales and execution (1283) of David III, the last native prince of Wales, gave the title to his son, the future Edward II. Since that time most, but not all, of the eldest sons of English sovereigns have been given the title. It is specifically granted by the sovereign, and in due course the recipient is invested as prince of Wales. The title ceases to exist when a prince of Wales becomes king, until a monarch bestows it upon a son.
