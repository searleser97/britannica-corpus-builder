Brady Law, in full Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act,  U.S. legislation, adopted in 1993, that imposed an interim five-day waiting period for the purchase of a handgun until 1998, when federally licensed dealers would be required to use a federal National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) to conduct background checks on individuals purchasing any firearm. Before the measure became law, it was popularly known as the Brady bill, named for James Brady, the White House press secretary who was seriously injured in an attempted assassination of Pres. Ronald Reagan in 1981. Brady, confined to a wheelchair and unable to resume his duties, campaigned vigorously for the bill, despite fierce opposition from the National Rifle Association (NRA), one of Washingtonâ€™s most-formidable interest groups. The waiting period went into effect on February 28, 1994. As originally written, the Brady Law required state and local law-enforcement officials to perform background checks during the five-day waiting period. That provision, however, was struck down by the Supreme Court in Printz v. United States (1997). The NICS was created by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and became operational on November 30, 1998.
