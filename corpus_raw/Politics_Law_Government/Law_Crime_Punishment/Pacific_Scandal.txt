Pacific Scandal,  (1872–73), charges of corruption against Canadian prime minister Sir John A. Macdonald in awarding the contract for a transcontinental railroad; the incident resulted in the downfall of Macdonald’s Conservative administration.
One of the conditions under which British Columbia entered the Dominion of Canada (1871) was that a railway to link that province with the east be constructed within 10 years. In 1872 a contract for construction of such a railway was awarded to a syndicate headed by Sir Hugh Allan, a Canadian shipowner and financier. Allan was a heavy contributor to the Conservative campaign in the 1872 election, and Macdonald’s Liberal opponents accused him of having awarded the contract in return for this financial support (April 1873). The charges led to the resignation of the Macdonald government on November 5 and to the cancellation of the contract. In the election of January 1874, the Conservatives were badly beaten.
