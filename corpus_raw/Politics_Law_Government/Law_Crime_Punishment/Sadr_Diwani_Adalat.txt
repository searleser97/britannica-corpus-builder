Ṣadr Dīwānī ʿAdālat,  in Mughal and British India, a high court of civil and revenue jurisdiction. It was instituted by Warren Hastings, the British governor-general, in 1772. It sat in Calcutta (now Kolkata) and was the final court of appeal in civil matters; it consisted of the governor-general and two members of his council.
When the Bengal government clashed with the Supreme Court of Calcutta, which administered English law, Hastings tried to solve the problem of conflicting jurisdiction by persuading the chief justice, Sir Elijah Impey, to become head of the Ṣadr Dīwānī ʿAdālat as well. But the East India Company vetoed the arrangement. This high civil court, like its counterpart for criminal jurisdiction—the Ṣadr Nizāmat ʿAdālat—was abolished after the Indian Mutiny of 1857–58, and its powers and jurisdiction were transferred to new high courts of judicature set up by the Indian High Courts Act of 1861.
