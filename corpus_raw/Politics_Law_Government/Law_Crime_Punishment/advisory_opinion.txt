Advisory opinion,  in law, the opinion of a judge, a court, or a law official, such as an attorney general, upon a question of law raised by a public official or legislative body. Advisory opinions adjudicate nothing and are not binding, though courts sometimes cite them as evidence of the law. Federal courts in the United States will not issue advisory opinions, but such opinions are issued occasionally by a few state courts and routinely by the attorneys general of the various states upon the request of the governor, legislators, or other state officials. The opinions typically refer to the legality of some contemplated official action. Advisory opinions originated very early in English law as a result of extralegal consultation of judges by the king or the House of Lords on questions that often were not even related to the law. The function of the opinions was wholly non- or extralegal.
