Barrackpore Mutiny, also spelled Barrackpur Mutiny,  (Nov. 2, 1824), incident during the First Anglo-Burmese War (1824–26), generally regarded as a dress rehearsal for the Indian Mutiny of 1857 because of its similar combination of Indian grievances against the British, caste feeling, and the ineptitude of its handling. During the war, Indian forces of the 47th regiment were ordered to march to Chittagong by land because caste taboo forbade high-caste men to go by sea. Under the regulations they had to transport their personal effects, also subject to caste rules, but had no bullocks available because the army had already engaged the supply. The men’s complaints and petitions were disregarded, and their grievances increased when camp followers were offered higher pay than the troops themselves. When the regiment refused to march, it was surrounded on the parade ground, bombarded by the artillery, and forced to flee under fire.
The regiment’s name was erased from the army list, the ringleaders were hanged, and others were imprisoned. The incident nearly led to the recall of the British governor-general, Lord Amherst, and the military authorities were criticized for their rigidity and vindictive harshness.
