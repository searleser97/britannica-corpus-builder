Twenty-third Amendment,  amendment (1961) to the Constitution of the United States that permitted citizens of Washington, D.C., the right to choose electors in presidential elections. It was proposed by the U.S. Congress on June 16, 1960, and its ratification was certified on March 29, 1961.
Washington is a federal district rather than a state, and residents of the District of Columbia are thus not citizens of a state. As such, though residents of the U.S. capital pay federal taxes and are subject to the same military obligations as citizens in the states, they historically have been denied the privilege of electing federal public officials. The Twenty-third Amendment established a vote for District residents in presidential elections, allocating to Washington electoral votes equal to the number of the least-populated state (in effect, three). Residents continue to be unrepresented in the U.S. Congress, though in 1970 Congress, which, per the U.S. Constitution, has exclusive jurisdiction over the federal district, established a nonvoting elected delegate to the House of Representatives. Several “DC Statehood” organizations seeking to provide to the citizens of the District the full rights belonging to the citizens of any state have been established. In 1978 Congress approved an amendment that would have repealed the Twenty-third Amendment and would have given District residents those full rights. However, it failed to be ratified by the required number of states and was never adopted.
