Extortion,   the unlawful exaction of money or property through intimidation. Extortion was originally the complement of bribery, both crimes involving interference with or by public officials. But extortion and, to a limited extent, bribery have been expanded to include actions by private citizens as well.
Extortion may include threats of harm to a person or his property, threats to accuse him of a crime, or threats to reveal embarrassing information. Some forms of threat are occasionally singled out for separate statutory treatment under the designation “blackmail.”
The scope given to the offense of extortion in a particular legal system is determined partly by the content of the related offense of robbery. Robbery is typically confined to taking property from the person or presence of the victim by violence or by threat to do an immediate physical harm. More remote and less terrifying threats fall within the province of the extortion and blackmail statutes. It is sometimes said that in extortion the victim consents, although under duress, while in robbery his will is overwhelmed so that there is no consent; but this is an extremely tenuous distinction.
The crime of extortion is defined to exclude lawful bargaining processes; for example, a union official may threaten to call a strike for higher wages. Such threats are criminal only if used to obtain money or property for the personal gain of the actor. See also bribery.
