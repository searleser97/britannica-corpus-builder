Iguala Plan, Spanish Plan de Iguala,  (Feb. 24, 1821), appeal issued by Agustín de Iturbide, a creole landowner and a former officer in the Spanish army who had assumed leadership of the Mexican independence movement in 1820. His plan called for an independent Mexico ruled by a European prince (or by a Mexican—i.e., Iturbide himself—if no European could be found), retention by the Roman Catholic Church and the military of all of their powers, equal rights for creoles and peninsulares (those of Spanish ancestry on both sides, born in Mexico and Spain, respectively), and elimination of property confiscations. The conservative plan soon won the approval of virtually every influential group in Mexico, though it completely ignored the rights of the lower classes. Thus, the achievement of independence in Mexico stood in contrast to the independence movement in South America, where liberal elements predominated. The conservative upper classes, including the higher clergy, now sanctioned Mexican independence because it freed them from the newly installed Liberal government in Spain, which they feared would upset the social and economic status quo in Mexico. On Aug. 24, 1821, Iturbide and the Spanish viceroy, Juan O’Donojú, signed the Convention of Córdoba (a town in Veracruz state), by which Spain acquiesced in the Iguala Plan and agreed to withdraw its troops. The Spanish government subsequently refused to accept the Convention (1822), but Iturbide had already made himself emperor of Mexico.
