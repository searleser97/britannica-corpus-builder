Ecloga,   (from Greek eklogē, “selection”), compilation of Byzantine law issued in 726 by Emperor Leo III the Isaurian in his name and that of his son Constantine. It is the most important Byzantine legal work following the 6th-century Code of Justinian.
Leo issued the law code in Greek instead of the traditional Latin, so that it could be understood by more people and utilized by judges as a practical legal manual. Though the Ecloga continued to be based on Roman law, Leo revised it in the spirit of “greater humanity” and on the basis of Christian principles.
In civil law the rights of women and children were enhanced at the expense of those of the father, whose power was sharply curtailed. In criminal law the application of capital punishment was restricted to cases involving treason, desertion from the military, and certain types of homicide, heresy, and slander. The code eliminated the death penalty for many crimes previously considered capital offenses, often substituting mutilation. Equal punishment was prescribed for individuals of all social classes. In an attempt to eliminate bribery and favouritism, the code provided salaries for officials in judicial service and forbade the acceptance of gifts.
The Ecloga had a strong influence on later Byzantine legislation as well as on the development of law in the Slavic countries beyond the Byzantine frontiers.
