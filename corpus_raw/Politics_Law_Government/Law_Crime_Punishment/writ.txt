Writ,   in common law, order issued by a court in the name of a sovereign authority requiring the performance of a specific act. The most common modern writs are those, such as the summons, used to initiate an action. Other writs may be used to enforce the judgment of a court (attachment, delivery) or to require a lower court to furnish certain records (error) or perform a certain act (mandamus).
Writs can be traced back to the Anglo-Saxon kings, who used them primarily to convey grants of land, although they also made some effort to employ them for judicial purposes. Three main types of writ were in use by the early 13th century: charters, normally for grants of land and liberties in perpetuity; letters patent, for grants of limited duration and for commissions to royal officials; and letters close, to convey information or orders to a single person or to a definite group of people (differing from the other two types of writ in that the kingâ€™s seal authenticated and closed the document).
Writs began to be used in judicial matters by the Norman kings, who developed set formulas for them. The most important were original writs, for beginning actions; in many instances they served much the same purpose as the modern summons. They were issued to the defendant, requiring that he make amends or else appear in court. Other important writs were those of assistance, for the transference of property, and entry, for the recovery of land from which one had been wrongfully dispossessed. 
The European civil-law system never developed a series of clearly defined writs, although it found other means to accomplish the same ends.
