Kaziasker,  (from Arabic qāḍī, “judge,” and ʿaskar, “army”), the second highest officer in the judicial hierarchy of the Ottoman Empire; he ranked immediately after the shaykh al-Islām, the head of the ʿulamāʾ (men of religious learning).
The title was created by Sultan Murad I (reigned 1360–89), who appointed Çandarli Kara Halil as the first kaziasker. In that office he accompanied the army in campaigns and dispensed justice in camp. After the conquest of Istanbul (1453), Sultan Mehmed II (reigned 1444–46, 1451–81) duplicated the office on advice of the grand vizier Karamani Mehmed Paşa, who was envious of the powers of the incumbent kaziasker. Thenceforth there were two kaziaskers, one of Rumelia (Ottoman territories in the Balkans) and the other of Anatolia.
Both kaziaskers had the authority to appoint the judges and professors at theological schools in their respective areas, except those of Istanbul, Bursa, and Edirne. They dealt with matters of inheritance and marriage and had seats in the state council. During the 17th century, however, the kaziasker of Rumelia deprived his Anatolian counterpart of most of his authority and came to deal with all cases of inheritance concerning Muslims and extended his authority to estates, to debts of the state, and to interests of the treasury. His authority extended to the three Barbary states, and his jurisdiction over the Crimean Peninsula was recognized by the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca (1774).
