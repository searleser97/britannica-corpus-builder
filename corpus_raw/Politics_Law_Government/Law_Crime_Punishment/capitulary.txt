Capitulary,   ordinance, usually divided into articles (Latin: capitula), promulgated by the Carolingian sovereigns (Charlemagne and his heirs) in western Europe (8th to late 9th century). These ordinances dealt with various issues of administration, the royal domains, and public order and justice, as well as with ecclesiastical problems. Similar acts had been promulgated earlier by the Merovingians.
In Carolingian times capitularies that dealt with ecclesiastical matters were separated from those dealing with secular affairs. The latter fell into three main categories. The first were intended to supplement or modify the national laws of the Carolingian peoples. They were concerned with penal law, with rules of procedure, or with private law. The second were ordinances resulting from an agreement between the king and his assembly of notables. These were directed at the territories within the realm and dealt with the relationships of the subjects to it. The third were instructions, resulting from the kingâ€™s personal decisions, to the missi dominici, emissaries who were sent to the provinces to supervise the local administration and to ensure obedience to royal commands.
No capitularies exist in their original form, and it is necessary to study copies or copies of copies that often contain numerous errors. For this reason it is often difficult to make an absolute determination of their nature. The Carolingians did not legislate according to a fixed system, and the foregoing distinctions are only approximate.
