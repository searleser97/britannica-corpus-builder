Hanging,  execution or murder by strangling or breaking the neck by a suspended noose. The traditional method of execution involves suspending victims from a gallows or crossbeam until they have died of asphyxiation. In another common method, persons to be hanged stand on a trapdoor, and, when the trap is released, they fall several feet until stopped by the rope tied around their neck. The jerk breaks the cervical vertebrae and is thought to cause immediate loss of consciousness. A knot or metal eyelet (the hangman’s knot) in the noose helps jerk back the victim’s head sharply enough to break the neck.
Hanging was one of the modes of execution under ancient Roman law, and it was subsequently derived by the Anglo-Saxons from their Germanic ancestors. It had become the prescribed mode of punishment for homicide in England by the 12th century, and in time it came to supersede all other forms of capital punishment for felony convictions until the abolition of capital punishment in Great Britain in 1965. Public hangings were held in England until 1868, when they were removed to prisons.
Hanging became the standard mode of execution throughout the British Empire and wherever else the Anglo-American common law was adopted. It also came into use in Russia, Austria, Hungary, and Japan. Hanging was the preeminent means of execution in the United States until the mid-20th century. In the United States and elsewhere, hanging was also usually the mode of murder used in lynchings.
