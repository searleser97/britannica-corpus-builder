Remainder,   in Anglo-American law, a future interest held by one person in the property of another, which, upon the happening of a certain event, will become his own. The holder of this interest is known in legal terms as a remainderman.
The law recognizes two types of remainder interests: the vested remainder and the contingent remainder. A remainder vests if, at the time it is created, the remainderman exists and is ascertainable, and no condition need first occur to identify him. Thus, when property is given to one person for his life and, at his death, the property is to go to a living third person, that third person has a vested remainder in the property. If, however, property is given to one for his life, the property to go to his heirs at his death, the interest in the property given to his heirs is a contingent remainder, because his heirs will not definitely be known until his death.
