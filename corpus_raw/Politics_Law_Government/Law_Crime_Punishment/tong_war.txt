Tong war,   any of several feuds carried on in U.S. cities (e.g., San Francisco and Los Angeles) between gangs of Chinese immigrants or their descendants. These gang wars spanned a 70-year period beginning in the 1850s and continuing until the 1920s. The term tong, meaning a hall, or meeting place, came to be used by the white population in the 1880s, usually to refer to the secret societies or fraternal organizations that were involved in illegal activities, such as opium trade or gambling.
The original tongs were benevolent protective associations, an American form of a political-religious organization that originated in 17th-century China. The tendency to form such societies in the United States grew out of the Chinese immigrants’ need for protection against lawless members of their own society as well as discrimination and criminal acts on the part of the white population. New, smaller, specialized tongs of merchants, craftsmen, and tradesmen grew up, and gradually along the Pacific Coast a society of organized criminals also developed. They specialized in opium and gambling, activities that were tolerated in China but were illegal in the United States. Criminal tong revenues came also from prostitution and selling “protection” to Chinese merchants. As their number grew, territorial and operational disputes developed, resulting in violent clashes between the criminal tongs. There were, however, tongs that remained free of strife and illegal activities. The criminal tongs began to disappear as the Chinese population became less susceptible to gang threats and intimidation.
