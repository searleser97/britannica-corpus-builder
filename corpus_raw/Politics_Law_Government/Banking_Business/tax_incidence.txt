Tax incidence,  the distribution of a particular taxâ€™s economic burden among the affected parties. It measures the true cost of a tax levied by the government in terms of lost utility or welfare. The initial incidence (also called statutory incidence) of a tax is the initial distribution among taxpayers of a legal obligation to remit tax receipts to the government. The final incidence (also called economic incidence) of a tax is the final burden of that particular tax on the distribution of economic welfare in society. The difference between the initial incidence and the final incidence is called tax shifting.
For example, the government may levy a tax on gasoline sales, typically a certain amount per gallon. Initially, that tax falls on the retail seller of gasoline, who is responsible for remitting tax receipts. Therefore, the statutory incidence is on the retail seller. However, the retail seller commonly passes on that tax to the purchaser of gasoline by reflecting it in the price of gasoline. As a result, the purchaser bears the final burden, the economic incidence. The government therefore effectively uses the gasoline retail seller as its tax collector.
Tax analysis dates to the physiocrats, a group of French economists who founded the first formal economic school of thought in the 18th century. Economists formally study tax incidence by using the tools of supply and demand analysis.
