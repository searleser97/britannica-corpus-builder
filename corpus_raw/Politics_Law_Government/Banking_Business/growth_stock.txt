Growth stock,  stock whose market value is expected to increase at a faster-than-average rate, usually because the issuing company is part of an expanding industry or because it has strong growth characteristics (e.g., an active and successful research and development department, an array of new products with wide consumer appeal, highly successful marketing programs, or exceptionally good management). The most advantageous time for purchasing growth stocks is before they are generally recognized as such.
The advantages of buying growth stocks include their rapid growth in value, as compared with that of blue-chip stocks, and the tax advantages of receiving income as capital gains when the stock is sold rather than in high dividends, which are taxed as regular income. There are also several dangers or disadvantages. One is that by the time a company is recognized as a growth company, it may be at the end of its rapid-growth period. Also, the high profits in an expanding industry may draw many competitors. If the original firm does not continue to grow, the investor may have sacrificed high dividends without the compensating gain in share value. Another problem is the difficulty of identifying a growth stock.
