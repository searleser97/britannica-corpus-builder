Liggett Group Inc.,  former U.S. conglomerate that once held major interests in tobacco products, spirits and wines, and pet foods.
In 1849 J.E. Liggett and Brother was established in St. Louis, Mo., by John Edmund Liggett (1826–97) as an outgrowth of a family concern dating to 1822. George S. Myers entered the business in 1873, and in 1878 the company was incorporated as Liggett & Myers Company. By 1885 it was the world’s largest manufacturer of plug chewing tobacco, at a time in the United States when chewing was by far the most popular use of tobacco. Not until the 1890s did the company begin producing cigarettes.
From 1899 to 1911 Liggett & Myers was part of the American tobacco trust (see American Brands, Inc.), but it reemerged after dissolution of the trust by the U.S. Court of Appeals and was reincorporated in 1911 as Liggett & Myers Tobacco Company, headquartered in Durham, N.C.
Until 1964 the company engaged exclusively in making tobacco products (with such familiar brands as Chesterfield and L&M cigarettes), but in that year it began diversifying with the purchase of Allen Products Company, makers of pet foods. Two years later it acquired controlling interest in Paddington Corporation and Carillon Importers Ltd., importers of spirits and wines (e.g., J&B scotch, Grand Marnier liqueur, Campari aperitif). In 1968 the corporate name was changed to Liggett & Myers Incorporated; in 1976 it was again changed, to Liggett Group Inc. In 1977 Diversified Products Corporation, makers of sporting goods, merged with the Liggett Group.
In 1980 the Liggett Group was acquired by a British-based conglomerate, Grand Metropolitan PLC, which sold it in 1986 to American financier Bennett S. LeBow. In 1999 Liggett sold the L&M, Lark, and Chesterfield brands to cigarette manufacturer Philip Morris.
