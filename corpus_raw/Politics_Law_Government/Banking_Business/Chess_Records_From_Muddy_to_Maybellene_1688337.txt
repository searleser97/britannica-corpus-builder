 In 1947 brothers Leonard and Phil Chess became partners with Charles and Evelyn Aron in the Aristocrat Record Company. The Chesses had operated several taverns on Chicago’s South Side—the last and largest of which was the Mocamba Lounge—and their desire to record one of the singers who performed in their nightclub led them into the record business. In 1950, after buying out the Arons, they changed the name of their company to Chess and attracted an unparalleled roster of blues artists who had come to the city from the Mississippi Delta, including Muddy Waters, Howlin’ Wolf, the second Sonny Boy Williamson (Alex [“Rice”] Miller), Little Walter, and Bo Diddley. Bassist-arranger Willie Dixon was a vital presence at these blues sessions, writing several classic songs, including “I’m Your Hoochie Coochie Man.” He also was versatile enough to help deliver Chuck Berry’s version of rock and roll.  As rhythm and blues began to infiltrate the pop market, Chess and its subsidiary label, Checker, recorded such vocal groups as the Moonglows and the Flamingos and administered the Arc and Jewel publishing companies through Maurice Levy. Levy managed disc jockey Alan Freed and assigned to him a share of the songwriting royalties for the Moonglows’ “Sincerely” and Berry’s “Maybellene.”
