Hellēnotamiai, (Greek: “treasurers of the Greeks”)  financial officers of the Delian League (478–404 bce) and instruments of Athenian control over league affairs. The hellēnotamiai, all Athenians, were elected annually and put in charge of the funds contributed by the various allied cities. Originally their headquarters were at Delos, and their removal to Athens in 454 bce caused resentment among league members. The office was abolished along with the league itself in 404 bce.
