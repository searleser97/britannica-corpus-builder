World Confederation of Labour (WCL),  labour confederation founded as the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions in 1920 to represent the interests of Christian labour unions in western Europe and Latin America. It was reconstituted under its present name in 1968. Although the confederation seeks national, regional, and international economic integration, its influence is primarily limited to domestic policies and local affairs in member countries. The WCL is the smallest international labour federation.
