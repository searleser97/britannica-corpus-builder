Trade show, also known as trade fair,  temporary market organized to promote trade, where buyers and sellers gather to transact business and to explore business opportunities. Trade shows are organized at regular intervals, generally at the same location and period of the year, and they may last for a few days or several weeks. They have assumed an increasingly important role in international trade, particularly in Europe and Asia, where nearly every country has at least one major annual international exposition. These may range from general exhibits of goods and merchandise to more particular exhibits highlighting one industry or branch of industrial production. Historically, the general trade shows with displays of many types of products and services were common, but trade shows have grown increasingly specialized.
Among the well-known commercial trade shows are the Swiss Industries Fair, the Milan Fair, and the International Trade Fair of Thessalon√≠ki (Greece). Popular specialized trade shows include the International Textile and Clothing Industry Exhibition (Ghent, Belgium), the Canadian Chemical and Process Equipment Exhibition (Toronto), the Frankfurt Book Fair (Germany), and the International Furniture Fair (Cologne, Germany). One of the largest annual trade shows in the world is CeBIT (Hannover, Germany), a telecommunications and information technology exhibition.
