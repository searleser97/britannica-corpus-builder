Telefónica SA,  Spanish company that is one of the world’s leaders in the telecommunications industry. Headquarters are in Madrid.
Telefónica is the main service provider in Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking markets. The company offers a wide range of services, including fixed and mobile telephony, Internet and broadband, content management, directories, applications, and customer-relations management. It was created in 1924 under the name of Compañía Telefónica Nacional de España (CTNE), whose shareholder was New York’s International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation (later renamed ITT Corporation). The company was nationalized in 1945 and, under the control of the Spanish government, was the country’s sole telephone operator until 1997. It became entirely privately owned in 1999. Telefónica adopted its current name in 1988. At the turn of the 21st century, it had a significant presence in some 15 countries and was operating companies in approximately 40 countries; the bulk of the company’s growth was occurring in Latin America.
In 1994 Telefónica launched the mobile-telephone provider Movistar, under which it thereafter began integrating its brands in an effort to achieve a more uniform image. Owing to shrinking demand and profitability in the telecommunications sector following the collapse of the dot-com boom in the late 1990s, Telefónica engaged in a series of sales, acquisitions, and joint ventures in the early 21st century.
