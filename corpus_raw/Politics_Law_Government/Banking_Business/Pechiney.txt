Pechiney,   French state-owned, multinational holding company formed in December 1971 as Pechiney Ugine Kuhlmann SA after the merger of Pechiney SA, an aluminum producer established in 1855, and Société Ugine Kuhlmann, an aluminum maker and chemical company established in 1889. In 1982 the French government nationalized the company, and its name was shortened to the present one in 1983. Its headquarters are in Paris.
The Pechiney firm had its origins in a caustic-soda factory founded in Salindres, Gard, France, by the engineer Henri Merle in 1855. His firm, the Compagnie des Produits Chimiques d’Alais et de la Camargue, produced its first aluminum, using a chemical process developed by Henri Sainte-Clair Deville, in 1860. The company’s manager from 1877 to 1906 was A.R. Pechiney, who, after passing up earlier opportunities, began using the highly efficient electrolytic process to extract aluminum in 1897. Under his leadership the firm became informally but widely known as Pechiney as it steadily expanded its aluminum production. The Alais et Camargue firm survived World Wars I and II intact because its industrial plants were located mostly in southern, rather than in northern, France.
In 1971 the company merged with Société Ugine Kuhlmann. The new organization became France’s first industrial conglomerate, with such varied activities as aluminum and copper refining, electrometallurgy, nuclear power, and the making of specialty steels and basic chemicals. Pechiney was stripped of most of its subsidiaries after the nationalization of 1982, however, and produced mostly aluminum until it acquired American National Can, one of the world’s largest packaging companies, in 1988. Pechiney remains France’s leading producer of aluminum and is a world leader in packaging products (cans, bottles, plastics).
