ConocoPhillips,  U.S. oil and gas company created in 2002 through the merger of Phillips Petroleum and Conoco. From 2002 until 2012 ConocoPhillips was a fully integrated petroleum company, involved in all stages of the industry from exploration and drilling through production at the wellhead to refining and marketing of final products. In 2012 the “upstream” and “downstream” portions of the company were split apart. At that point ConocoPhillips became an upstream company, engaging in the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas deposits around the world and of oil sands in Canada. The former downstream portions became Phillips 66, a separate company engaged in the refining and marketing of petroleum products around the world under brand names such as Phillips 66, 76, and Jet; it also retained the parent company’s interests in the production of petrochemicals. The new ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66 divided “midstream” activities such as the processing and transporting of natural gas. Both companies are headquartered in Houston, Texas.
