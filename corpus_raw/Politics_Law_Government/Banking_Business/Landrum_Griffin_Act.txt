Landrum-Griffin Act, formally the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (1959),  a legislative response to widespread publicity about corruption and autocratic methods in certain American labour unions during the 1950s. Even though the AFL-CIO (American Federation of Laborâ€“Congress of Industrial Organizations) expelled three of the worst offenders (the Teamsters, the Bakery and Confectionery Workers, and the Laundry Workers Union), President Dwight D. Eisenhower and the McClellan committee, which had investigated ties between labour and organized crime, insisted on a law to put internal union affairs on a more honest and democratic basis.
Thus, the Landrum-Griffin Act instituted federal penalties for labour officials who misused union funds, who had been found guilty of specific crimes, or who had violently prevented union members from exercising their legal rights. The act contained other provisions that strengthened parts of the Taft-Hartley Act (q.v.), which was detested by nearly all elements of organized labour. These provisions included a strict ban on secondary boycotts (union efforts to stop one employer from dealing with another employer who is being struck or boycotted) and greater freedom for individual states to set the terms of labour relations within their borders. The latter provision hampered labour organizing in the South, the least unionized region in the United States.
