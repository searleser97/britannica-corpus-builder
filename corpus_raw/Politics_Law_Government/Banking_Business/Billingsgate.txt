Billingsgate,  former London market (closed 1982). It was situated in the City of London at the north end of London Bridge beside The Monument, which commemorates the outbreak of the Great Fire of September 1666.
In the Middle Ages the wharf at Billingsgate was a principal unloading point for fish, salt, and other cargoes. Parliament made it an open fish market in 1698, from which time the gentlemen of the Fishmongers Company, their boots silvered with scales, exercised their functions there, maintaining it as London’s principal fish market. Market activities were moved in 1982 to large modernized premises at the north of the peninsular Isle of Dogs (in Tower Hamlets), where they now neighbour the Canary Wharf office district. The original Billingsgate building was later transformed into an office complex.
The old market was notorious for a type of coarse, vituperative speech referred to as “billingsgate.” The derivation of the market’s name is, however, uncertain.
For another perspective on the market, see Billingsgate from Encyclopædia Britannica’s 3rd edition (1788–97).
