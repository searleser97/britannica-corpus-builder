Pillsbury Company,  former American flour miller and food products manufacturer that was acquired by its rival, General Mills, in 2001. Both companies were headquarted in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Through its long history in the baking-goods industry, its cookbooks, and its promotional baking contests—notably the annual Pillsbury Bake-Off—Pillsbury became identified with home baking. One of the company’s first products, Pillsbury’s Best flour, is still produced.
The company originated in 1869 when Charles A. Pillsbury bought a share in a Minneapolis flour mill. After the purchase of additional mills and the introduction of enhancements to the milling process, his firm was reorganized in 1872 as C.A. Pillsbury and Company. It was sold in 1889 to an English syndicate, which merged Pillsbury with other mills in their holdings to form Pillsbury-Washburn Flour Mills Company, Ltd., with Charles Pillsbury as managing director. The Pillsbury family regained ownership of the company in the 1920s, and it was incorporated as Pillsbury Flour Mills Company in 1935. In 1972 Pillsbury began purchasing Burger King fast-food outlets, and it soon came to own the entire chain. Through the Green Giant Company, acquired in 1979, it began marketing canned and frozen vegetables and frozen prepared foods. It also acquired Häagen-Dazs, maker of premium ice cream and frozen yogurt, in 1983.
Pillsbury was owned by British company Grand Metropolitan, PLC (renamed Diageo PLC) from 1989 to 2001, when General Mills acquired most of Pillsbury’s assets (Burger King remained as a separate division of Diageo until 2002). The Häagen-Dazs brand was marketed through a joint licensing agreement with Nestlé and General Mills. The company manufactures a wide variety of consumer food products under the Pillsbury brand, including frozen biscuits and rolls, breakfast foods, cookie dough, cake mixes, and snack foods.
