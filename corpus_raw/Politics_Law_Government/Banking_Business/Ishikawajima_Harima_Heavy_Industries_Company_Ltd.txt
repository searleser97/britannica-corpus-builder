Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Company, Ltd., Japanese Ishikawajima–Harima Jūkōgyō KK,  major Japanese manufacturer of heavy machinery and oceangoing ships. Headquarters are in Tokyo.
The company was founded by the Mito branch of the Tokugawa family in 1853 as a shipbuilding yard in Edo (modern Tokyo); it was incorporated in 1889. The Harima Dock (later Harima Shipbuilding and Engineering) was established in 1907 in Kōbe. The merger of the two shipyards in 1960 resulted in the present company. Ishikawajima-Harima pioneered in the development of tankers to transport liquid natural gas, and the company remains in the forefront of ship design for the energy industry. One of its largest projects was the construction of a floating pulp factory, designed to process pulpwood.
Aggressive merger tactics have helped bring the company to its present status as one of Japan’s major corporations, and acquisition of a number of varied companies in the 1960s has diversified the scope of the firm beyond shipbuilding. The company and its subsidiaries also produce marine and aircraft engines, chemical products, iron and steel manufacturing equipment, and material-handling machinery.
The company operates on a global scale, with offices throughout North and South America, Europe, and the Far East. Export revenues account for approximately half of the company’s annual sales.
