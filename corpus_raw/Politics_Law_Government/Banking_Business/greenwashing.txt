Greenwashing, also called green sheen,  a form of deceptive marketing in which a company, product, or business practice is falsely or excessively promoted as being environmentally friendly. A portmanteau of green and whitewash, greenwashing was originally used to describe the practice of overselling a product’s “green” characteristics. However, as the environmental movement gained momentum and more corporations tried to frame themselves as ecofriendly, the range of greenwashing transgressions widened. Today, charges of greenwashing have been applied to a broad range of unethical behaviours, such as deceptive marketing practices, untruthful environmental reporting, and fraudulent environmental activism.
