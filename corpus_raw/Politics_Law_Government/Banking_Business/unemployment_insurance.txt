Unemployment insurance,   a form of social insurance (q.v.) designed to compensate certain categories of workers for unemployment that is involuntary and short-term. Unemployment insurance programs were created primarily to provide financial assistance to laid-off workers during a period deemed long enough to enable them to find another job or be rehired at their original job. In most countries, workers who have been permanently disabled or who have been unemployed for a long period of time are not covered by unemployment insurance but are usually covered by other plans. In such countries as Canada, Germany, Israel, Norway, and the United Kingdom, all occupations are covered; the United States denies coverage to farm workers, domestic servants, workers who have been employed only briefly, government workers, and most self-employed workers; such countries as Austria, Ireland, and Japan exclude public employees.
Benefits vary from one legal jurisdiction to another. In most countries the benefits are related to earnings; a few countries pay a flat rate to all beneficiaries. In addition, benefits are usually paid only for a limited period of time.
Funding for unemployment insurance varies from country to country. Employers or employees may be taxed specifically for unemployment insurance, or funding may come out of general government revenues.
