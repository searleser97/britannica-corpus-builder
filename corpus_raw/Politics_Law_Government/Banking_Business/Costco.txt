Costco, in full Costco Wholesale Corporation,  American operator of discount stores of the type known as warehouse clubs or wholesale clubs, in which bulk quantities of merchandise are sold at deeply discounted prices to club members who pay an annual membership fee. It is one of the largest retailers in the world. Costco is based in Issaquah, Washington.
A Costco store typically carries supermarket items and an ever-changing selection of other merchandise, including some luxury goods. The stock is stacked high in a cavernous “warehouse” enclosing more than 140,000 square feet (13,000 square metres) of floor space. Despite the large area, a Costco store typically stocks only about 4,000 different items at any given time, about one-tenth of the variety that is available at the average supermarket. Most Costco stores also have ancillary businesses such as pharmacies and gasoline stations.
Costco traces its history back to 1976, when Sol Price, a pioneer in warehouse club retailing, opened the first Price Club in San Diego. Jeffrey H. Brotman and James D. Sinegal opened the first Costco in Seattle in 1983. The Price Company (corporate parent of Price Club) and Costco merged in 1993 to become Price/Costco. In 1997 the corporate name was changed to Costco Companies, Inc., and in 1999 the present corporate name was adopted. In the early 21st century the company operated stores in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Europe, the Far East, and Australia. The company was often praised for providing its employees with higher pay and better benefits than were customary in the field of retailing.
