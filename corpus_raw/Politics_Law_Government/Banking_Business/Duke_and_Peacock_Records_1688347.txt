A decade before the ascendance of Motown, Houston’s Duke and Peacock record labels flourished as an African-American-owned company. Don Robey, a nightclub owner with reputed underworld connections, founded Peacock Records in 1949 and ran it with an iron hand. In 1952 Robey and James Mattias of Duke Records (founded in Memphis, Tennessee, earlier in the year) formed a partnership. A year later Robey became the outright owner of Duke and centralized its operation in Houston. The company’s staples were gospel (the Five Blind Boys of Mississippi) and gospel-oriented blues (Bobby “Blue” Bland and Junior Parker, with arrangements by Joe Scott and Bill Harvey, respectively). In 1953 Willie Mae (“Big Mama”) Thornton recorded the first version of “Hound Dog,” which Elvis Presley turned into a rock-and-roll anthem three years later.  In 1954 Duke’s ballad singer Johnny Ace became the first martyr of the new teen era, losing at Russian roulette after a concert;  his posthumous hit “Pledging My Love” became one of the most-played “oldies” in the decades that followed.
