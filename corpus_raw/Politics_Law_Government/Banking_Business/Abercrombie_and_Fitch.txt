Abercrombie & Fitch,  American clothing retailer marketing casual wear to preteens, teens, and young adults. Headquarters are in New Albany, Ohio.
Abercrombie & Fitch originated in 1891 as a retail sporting goods concern based in New York City. It was famed for its wide variety of expensive and often exotic sporting equipment and attire, ranging from tennis shoes to elephant guns. For more than half a century, the store’s apparel, guns, tackle, and other merchandise were the image of correctness and opulence, inspiring the American humorist Ed Zern to lampoon a perfectly accoutred angler as an “Abercrombie and Fitcherman.”
When it expanded, the firm confined its new branch stores to downtown areas of large cities and to resort areas. In the early 1970s Abercrombie & Fitch attempted to widen its customer base by adding less-expensive items to its usual stock and by moving into the suburbs, where other stores had been building for some time. Although these steps did attract new customers, they came too late; Abercrombie & Fitch was in financial trouble and filed for bankruptcy in 1976 after 85 years in business.
Oshman’s Sporting Goods, Inc., bought the firm in1978. In 1988 Abercrombie & Fitch was bought by The Limited, Inc. Repositioned as the trademarked “casual luxury” brand, it became parent to the subsidiary brands abercrombie kids, a children’s line launched in 1998 and marketed as abercrombie; Hollister Co., a line for younger teens launched in 2000; RUEHL No. 925, a line targeting post-graduates launched in 2004; and Gilly Hicks, a women’s line launched in 2008. Following Abercrombie & Fitch’s overhaul, the company received significant criticism for its advertising and its clothing, which were perceived by many as encouraging its target audience to adopt a sexually promiscuous lifestyle.
