Norwest Corporation, formerly (until 1983) Northwest Bancorporation,  former American holding company that owned subsidiary commercial banks in a number of western and midwestern U.S. states. Norwest and Wells Fargo & Company merged in 1998, and the newly formed business took the latterâ€™s name.
The company was incorporated as Northwest Bancorporation in 1929 to control banks, trust companies, and other financial institutions in the north-central United States. It conducted a general banking business through its subsidiary banks, all of which provided a full range of commercial services and many of which provided trust services. Northwest Bancorporation merged with Dial Financial Corporation, an Iowa-based consumer loan company, in 1982. The Norwest Corp. name was adopted the following year.
