Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad Company,  American railroad built to carry coal from the anthracite fields of northeastern Pennsylvania. Originally known as Liggetâ€™s Gap Railroad, it was chartered in 1851 as the Lackawanna and Western. Eventually it ran from the Lackawanna Valley in Pennsylvania west to Buffalo, N.Y., north to Lake Ontario, and east to Hoboken, N.J.
The Lackawanna prospered in the early 20th century, but with the decline of coal heating and the rise of competing modes of transportation, its revenues fell. In 1960 it merged with the Erie Railroad Company, which had many miles of parallel trackage, to become the Erie Lackawanna Railway Company. In 1972 the Erie Lackawanna became bankrupt, and in 1976 it was taken over by the Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail) (q.v.).
