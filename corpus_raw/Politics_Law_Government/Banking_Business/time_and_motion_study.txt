Time-and-motion study,   in the evaluation of industrial performance, analysis of the time spent in going through the different motions of a job or series of jobs. Time-and-motion studies were first instituted in offices and factories in the United States in the early 20th century. These studies came to be adopted on a wide scale as a means of improving the methods of work by subdividing the different operations of a job into measurable elements. Such analyses were, in turn, used as aids to standardization of work and in checking the efficiency of people and equipment and the mode of their combination.
