Larousse, in full Librairie Larousse,  Parisian publishing house specializing in encyclopaedias and dictionaries, founded in 1852 by Augustin Boyer and Pierre Larousse, editor of the Grand Dictionnaire universel du XIXe siècle (15 vol., 1866–76; 2 supplements, 1878 and 1890). The many reference works later published by descendants of the founders derived from Larousse’s Grand Dictionnaire.
The Grand Dictionnaire universel du XIXe siècle, in the compilation of which Larousse was guided by the motto vulgariser sans abaisser (“popularize without debasing”), combined features of the dictionary and of the general short-entry encyclopaedia in offering concise, alphabetically arranged entries that included etymologies and examples of usage of the title words.
At the turn of the century, under the direction of Larousse’s nephew, Claude Augé, the Nouveau Larousse illustré (7 vol., 1897–1904; supplement, 1907), which was a modernized form of the Grand Dictionnaire, further exploited the Larousse short-entry style. It was especially noted for its articles on individual works of art. In 1907 Augé inaugurated a serial supplement to the Larousse publications, the monthly Larousse mensuel illustré: revue encyclopédique universelle (1907–40 and 1947–57), in which the articles are relatively long.
The Larousse du XXe siècle (6 vol., 1927–33; revised 1948–50; supplement, 1954), edited by Paul Augé, devoted special attention to World War I. In adopting a more popular approach and in using shorter entries than Pierre Larousse’s Grand Dictionnaire, it resembled the Nouveau Larousse illustré, of which it approximated a new edition.
The Grand Larousse encyclopédique (10 vol., 1960–64), also edited by Paul Augé, succeeded the three previous major Larousse encyclopaedias but was the first to be profusely illustrated and to offer comprehensive biographies.
Other Larousse publications include shorter general encyclopaedias, such as the Larousse pour tous: dictionnaire encyclopédique (2 vol., 1908), superseded in 1922 by the two-volume Larousse universel: dictionnaire encyclopédique; dictionaries, notably Pierre Larousse’s Dictionnaire de la langue française (1856) and its successor, Petit Larousse illustré (1906), edited by Claude Augé; children’s encyclopaedias, including the topically arranged Encyclopédie pour la jeunesse (5 vol., 1958–62); and the topically arranged encyclopaedia Grand Mémento encyclopédique (2 vol., 1936–37), re-edited as the Encyclopédie Larousse méthodique (1955).
The Pequeño Larousse ilustrado (1912), in later printings entitled Nuevo Pequeño Larousse ilustrado, is an adaptation in Spanish of the Petit Larousse illustré.
