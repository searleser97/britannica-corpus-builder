Codelco, byname of Corporación Nacional del Cobre de Chile (Spanish: “National Copper Corporation of Chile”),  state-owned Chilean mining company that is one of the largest copper producers in the world. Headquarters are in Santiago.
Codelco’s core business is the exploration, development, and exploitation of copper mineral resources, the processing and refining of copper, and its subsequent sale. The company was created in 1976 as a result of the 1971 nationalization of Chilean copper mining. Codelco was established as a state enterprise that grouped the deposit sites into a single mining, industrial, and commercial corporation. Codelco’s operations are conducted primarily through its four divisions: Codelco Norte, Andina, El Teniente, and El Salvador.
In the early 21st century Codelco controlled about 20 percent of the world’s copper reserves. It experienced a decrease in production and revenue because of issues such as declining capital and soaring energy costs. The company subsequently began exploring alternative forms of energy, including wind and solar power, and in 2011 formalized an agreement to sell uranium to France.
