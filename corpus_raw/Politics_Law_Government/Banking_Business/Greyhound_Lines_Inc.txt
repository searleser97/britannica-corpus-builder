Greyhound Lines, Inc.,  American corporation that has provided the major intercity bus transportation in the United States and Canada. Greyhound’s headquarters are in Dallas, Texas.
The company traces back to 1925–26, when intercity bus operators Eric Wickman and Orville S. Caesar joined forces, acquired financing, and merged several bus companies into the Motor Transit Management. Some of the early backers were the railroads, first the Great Northern Railroad and then the Southern Pacific, Pennsylvania, and New York Central railroads. A network of lines quickly spread across the country, through purchase of existing companies and inauguration of new lines. In 1930 Motor Transit officially became Greyhound Corporation, with the “running dog” as its trademark. By 1933 Greyhound had 40,000 route miles (65,000 km). In 1961, however, a policy decision was made to diversify, and in the succeeding decades the company became a conglomerate, expanding into several new products and services, such as toiletries and household-products manufacturing, catering, airport terminal services, and financial services; from 1970 to 1983 it also owned the meatpacking Armour & Company. Greyhound’s business operations became international.
In the early 1980s deregulation of the bus transit industry caused Greyhound Corporation to drop many of its local bus routes, isolating many small towns in rural United States. In 1987 the Greyhound Corporation (which was later renamed Greyhound Dial Corporation), based in Phoenix, Arizona, sold its historic bus operations. Greyhound Lines, Inc., based in Dallas, became an independent corporation devoted entirely to intercity bus transportation. In 1999 Greyhound merged with the Canadian bus company Laidlaw, Inc., which was subsequently purchased in 2007 by the British transit operator FirstGroup PLC.
