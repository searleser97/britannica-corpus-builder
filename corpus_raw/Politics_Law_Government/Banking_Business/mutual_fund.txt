Mutual fund, also called Unit Trust, or Open-end Trust,  company that invests the funds of its subscribers in diversified securities and in return issues units representing shares in those holdings. It differs from the investment trust (q.v.), which issues shares in its own capital. In contrast to closed-end investment companies, which have a fixed capitalization and whose shares are bought and sold by the investor in the market, mutual funds make a continuous offering of new shares at net asset value (plus a sales charge) and redeem their shares on demand at net asset value, determined daily by the market value of the securities they hold.
