Factoring,   in finance, the selling of accounts receivable on a contract basis by the business holding them—in order to obtain cash payment of the accounts before their actual due date—to an agency known as a factor. The factor then assumes full responsibility for credit analysis of new accounts, payments collection, and credit losses. Factoring differs from borrowing in that the accounts receivable and the responsibility for their collection are actually sold rather than merely offered as loan collateral. Factoring is employed especially by highly seasonal industries to shift the functions of credit and collection to a specialized agency.
Prior to the 20th century a factor was a business agent whose functions included warehousing and selling the commodities that were consigned to him, accounting to his principals for the proceeds, guaranteeing the credit of purchasers, and sometimes making cash advances to his principals before the actual sale of the goods took place. His services were of particular value in foreign trade, and factors became important figures in the great period of colonial exploration and development.
Although most modern factoring is in the textile field, factors are also used extensively in the shoe, furniture, hardware, and other industries, and the trade areas in which factors operate have increased. Factors are concentrated mainly in New York City, but their clients are scattered throughout the United States and Europe. Although factors have almost always been entirely commercial enterprises, some banks have entered the field through the acquisition of established factoring organizations, as well as by opening their own factoring departments.
