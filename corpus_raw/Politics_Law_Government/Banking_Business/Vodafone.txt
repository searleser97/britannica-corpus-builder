Vodafone,  telecommunications company based in the United Kingdom with interests in Europe and the United States. It originated as part of Racal, a British radar and electronics firm founded in 1950. Racal founded its Vodafone subsidiary in 1983 and won the license to build Britain’s first cellular telephone network, which was launched in 1985. By the early 1990s Vodafone was purchasing other companies and building network partnerships around the world.
The company roughly doubled its size in 2000 by acquiring German industrial conglomerate Mannesmann AG. Founded as Mannesmannroehren-Werke in 1890 by Reinhard Mannesmann (1856–1922), the German company had become a leading manufacturer of steel tubing and by the 1930s emerged as one of the six giant iron and steel works of the Ruhr. Although Mannesmann executives were not among the German industrialists who promoted the rise of Adolf Hitler, the company did contribute significantly to the war effort and therefore was stripped of nearly all its directors under the terms of the war-crimes mandate. Following reorganization of Germany’s basic industries according to Allied occupation policy, Mannesmann emerged as an independent company in 1952 and conducted business in Brazil, Canada, Argentina, Austria, and other European countries in industries such as transportation and telecommunications.
Vodafone’s hostile bid for Mannesmann resulted in what was then the largest merger in the world. In the process Vodafone had become one of the world’s leading providers of mobile telecommunications services, and it conducted business in more than 30 countries.
