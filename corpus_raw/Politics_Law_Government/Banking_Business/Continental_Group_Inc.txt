Continental Group, Inc.,, formerly (until 1976) Continental Can Company,  American manufacturer and distributor of metal, paper, and plastic packaging products. The company also produces package-making equipment and owns paper mills and a life insurance company, the Virginia-based Richmond Company. It is headquartered in Stamford, Conn.
The company was incorporated in 1913 to acquire three can-making companies. After acquiring a number of other can and paper companies, the name Continental Can Company was adopted. In 1976, however, the name was changed to the Continental Group to reflect the company’s diversification into forest products and insurance.
Continental is one of the world’s major multinational companies. It has been operating in Europe since 1930, when it began investing in Dutch and German packaging companies. In 1969 Continental, deciding that the American can market had become nearly saturated, determined to emphasize overseas operations, especially in Europe. In 1970 it formed what Continental hoped would become Europe’s largest packaging company, Europemballage Corporation. Antitrust action by the European Economic Community, however, eventually barred it from taking an increasing share of the European market. Continental also has marketing contracts in many countries outside western Europe, including Poland and China.
In 1976 Continental bought the Richmond Corporation, a small life insurance company that Continental hoped would provide the cash needed for continued expansion. The company also owns and operates an oil and gas exploration company and a natural-gas pipeline system. In the 1970s Continental modernized much of its equipment so as to produce thinner cans with only two pieces of metal instead of the three pieces needed in the old can-making process.
