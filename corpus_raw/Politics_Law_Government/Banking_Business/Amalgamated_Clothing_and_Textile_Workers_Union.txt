Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU),  former union of garment and apparel workers in the United States and Canada. It was formed in 1976 by the merger of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America (ACWA), a large union representing workers in the men’s clothing industry, with the Textile Workers Union of America, a smaller union founded in 1939. The ACWA was originally formed when militant elements within the United Garment Workers, a relatively conservative union, broke away in 1914 to form their own union under the leadership of Sidney Hillman (q.v.). He became president of the new union and held that office until his death in 1946. Under Hillman’s leadership the ACWA became the most important and successful of the clothing unions. It secured great improvements and benefits for its members, including cooperative housing, banks, and insurance programs. In 1933 the ACWA was admitted into the American Federation of Labor, but it withdrew to become a founding member of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) in 1935.
The merger of the ACWA with the Textile Workers Union of America in 1976 produced a new union, the ACTWU, which had a membership of about 500,000. Over the next two decades the ACTWU’s membership shrank along with employment in the American apparel industry, and in 1995 the ACTWU merged with the International Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Union to form the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees (UNITE), with a total membership of about 350,000.
