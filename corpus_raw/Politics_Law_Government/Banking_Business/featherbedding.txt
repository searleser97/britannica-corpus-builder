Featherbedding,   labour union practices that require the employer to pay for the performance of what he considers to be unnecessary work or for work that is not in fact performed or to employ workers who are not needed. The existence of featherbedding in any specific instance is usually disputed and depends on what is considered reasonable. Work rules that require large work crews or that restrict the amount of work a worker can do in a given time period may be considered featherbedding.
Featherbedding provisions in labour contracts may result from the continuation of work rules that were once efficient but that have become obsolete because of changed technology. A union may insist on the continuation of such work rules to ensure the employment security of its members. In some cases unions have obtained passage of building codes and other legislation ostensibly designed to ensure public safety but actually embodying featherbedding practices.
