French Democratic Confederation of Labour, French Confédération Française Démocratique du Travail (CFDT),  French trade union federation that evolved from the French Confederation of Christian Workers (Confédération Française des Travailleurs Chrétiens, or CFTC). Drawing some of its principles from the Roman Catholic church when it was founded in 1919, the CFTC had maintained close ties with the church. By the 1950s, however, a reforming minority within the CFTC wanted to break all confessional ties and reshape the federation on a social democratic basis. This eventually became the dominant viewpoint, and in 1964 a special congress voted to secularize the federation and rename it the French Democratic Confederation of Labour (CFDT). A minority group that wanted to keep a Christian orientation formed its own federation under the original name of French Confederation of Christian Workers.
From 1968 to 1977 the CFDT pursued radical policies, but it afterward returned to a moderate position. In 1989 it joined the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. The CFDT’s membership has declined somewhat since the mid-1970s, but it remains a major federation of labour unions in France. Most of its members work in service industries within the private sector.
