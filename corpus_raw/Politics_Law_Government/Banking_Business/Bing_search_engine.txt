Bing,  search engine launched in 2009 by the American software company Microsoft Corporation.
Microsoft’s previous search engine, Live Search, from the time of its release in 2006 consistently trailed well behind those of Google Inc., the industry giant, and the Internet portal site of Yahoo! Inc. Microsoft hoped to change the dynamics of the search-engine market with the release of Bing, a “decision engine” designed to display more retrieved information in search pages than was typical, thus enabling better-informed decisions concerning what links to follow or even, in some cases, displaying enough information to satisfy the original query. Bing also displayed related searches and the user’s previous searches on the left side of the page.
In July 2009 an agreement was reached in which Yahoo! would use Bing to power search on its portal site and would provide the sales force to work with companies that sought to do special campaigns on Bing. The Microsoft-Yahoo! arrangement was scheduled to last for 10 years, and Bing largely powered Yahoo! Search across the globe from 2012. In February 2010 the social networking site Facebook—which had more than 400 million users and was the second most-visited Web site after Google—made an agreement with Microsoft to present Bing results to users searching the World Wide Web from within Facebook. Although Bing’s market share was initially somewhat slow to gain on that of Google or Yahoo!, the search engine eventually became the second largest in the United States; however, Google remained the dominant search engine, with Bing drawing only a few percent of the market.
