France Telecom SA,  French telecommunications company, formerly with a monopoly status. Headquarters are in Paris.
The company provides fixed-line and wireless voice and data services, cable television, and telecommunications services for businesses. Its mobile telephone services operate under the aegis of Orange, the dominant mobile service provider in France in the early 21st century and a major player in Great Britain; it also provides services in other countries around the world.
The French telephone industry was nationalized in 1889; not until 1988, however, did the French government establish France Telecom as an independent entity. In 1997 the government offered 20 percent of the company to the public.
In the early 21st century, France Telecom engaged in a series of sales and acquisitions, expanding its international presence. After the French government relinquished its majority stake in 2004, France Telecom again became a privately held company and thereafter began integrating its subsidiaries under the Orange brand name.
