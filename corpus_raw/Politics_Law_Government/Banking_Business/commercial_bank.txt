Commercial bank,  bank with the power to make loans that, at least in part, eventually become new demand deposits. Because a commercial bank is required to hold only a fraction of its deposits as reserves, it can use some of the money on deposit to extend loans. When a borrower receives a loan, his checking account is credited with the amount of the loan; total demand deposits are thus increased until the loan is repaid. As a group, then, commercial banks are able to expand or contract the money supply by creating new demand deposits.
The name commercial bank was first used to indicate that the loans extended were short-term loans to businesses, though loans later were extended to consumers, governments, and other nonbusiness institutions as well. In general, the assets of commercial banks tend to be more liquid and carry less risk than the assets held by other financial intermediaries. Most commercial banks offer a variety of services to their customers, including savings deposits, safe-deposit boxes, and trust services.
