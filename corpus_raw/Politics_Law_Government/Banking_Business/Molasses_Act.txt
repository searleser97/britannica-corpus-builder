Molasses Act,  (1733), in American colonial history, a British law that imposed a tax on molasses, sugar, and rum imported from non-British foreign colonies into the North American colonies. The act specifically aimed at reserving a practical monopoly of the American sugar market to British West Indies sugarcane growers, who otherwise could not compete successfully with French and other foreign sugar producers on more-fertile neighbouring West Indian islands.
The American colonists protested the act, claiming that the British West Indies alone could not produce enough molasses to meet the colonies’ needs. Rum distilling was one of the leading industries in New England, and the act had the effect of raising the price of molasses there. The American colonists feared that the act’s effect would be to increase the price of rum manufactured in New England, thus disrupting the region’s exporting capacity. The Molasses Act was among the least effective of the British Navigation Acts, since it was largely circumvented through smuggling. (The practice of bribing customs officials to allow the import of cheaper French rum became common.) Had the act been systematically enforced, New England’s economy likely would have been crippled.  The act was later amended by the Sugar Act of 1764, which became an irritant contributing to the American Revolution.
