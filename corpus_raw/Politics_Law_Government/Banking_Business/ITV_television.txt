ITV, in full Independent Television,  in the United Kingdom, television network consisting of a consortium of private companies in competition with the British Broadcasting Corporation. It is regulated by the Office of Communications. The ITV network was authorized by an act of Parliament in 1954, when the BBC’s monopoly over radio and television broadcasting was modified to permit a single channel to operate by selling airtime to advertisers.
The innovation came into existence amid fierce political controversy. ITV differed from the American commercial-television model in that there was only one channel for the independent facility, and its broadcasts were subject to much greater regulation of advertising and involved a greater range of variety and program content.
There were four original contractors who were to share ITV’s single network: Rediffusion, Granada, ATV, and ABC. All were based on established cinema and show-business interests, and they quickly set about providing the popular peak-time viewing: variety shows, big-money quizzes, pop-music programs, and open-ended drama serials, or “soap operas.” ATV’s Sunday Night at the London Palladium remained a staple of the weekend viewing diet for 13 years; Granada’s Coronation Street, a twice-weekly saga of working-class life in Northern England, achieved great popularity. ATV in particular, under the dynamic leadership of Lew Grade (later Lord Grade), embarked on a series of fast-moving adventure programs, beginning with The Saint and Danger Man. Other popular ITV series included the detective shows Inspector Morse (1987–2000) and Agatha Christie’s Poirot (1989–2013), the competition Britain’s Got Talent (2007– ), and the period drama Downton Abbey (2010–15).
The immediate popularity of ITV had a devastating effect on the BBC, and ITV revenues soared from an initial £2,000,000 to more than £60,000,000. The BBC reacted by adding popular programming in prime viewing hours, and ITV programmers greatly enhanced their reputation by developing superiority in coverage of current affairs and in some documentary areas.
By 1973 ITV had 15 regional broadcasting licenses, each operated by a different company. The Broadcasting Act of 1990, for the first time, allowed mergers between owners of broadcasting licenses, and by 2016 a single company, ITV plc, owned 13 of the licenses. The number of channels began expanding in 1998 with the launch of ITV2. More channels followed in 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2014. ITV also introduced its first subscription channel in 2014.
