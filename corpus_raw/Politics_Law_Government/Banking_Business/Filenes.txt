Filene’s, formerly William Filene’s Sons Co.,  a Boston department store that pioneered a number of retailing innovations. It was founded in 1881 by Prussian immigrant William Filene and his sons, Edward and Lincoln.
Well-known for its high-quality fashion merchandise, Filene’s became famous for its Automatic Bargain Basement. This unique basement store was opened in 1909, selling “distress merchandise” (damaged, outdated, or unpopular items) at bargain prices, as did many other stores’ basements, but at Filene’s the prices were plainly marked and were automatically reduced by a set percentage after a given number of days if the goods remained unsold—25 percent after 12 selling days, another 25 percent at the end of 18 selling days, and a third 25 percent after 24 selling days; after 30 days the merchandise was given to charity. The basement operated at a loss for the first three years but subsequently became such a success that its earnings alone were responsible for maintaining the profitability of Filene’s during the Great Depression, when every other floor was operating at a loss.
Filene’s was the first store to use the charge-plate system and cycle billing, and it pioneered branch-store operation. In 1929 the store joined F. & R. Lazarus & Co. and Abraham & Straus to form Federated Department Stores, Inc. (See also Fred Lazarus, Jr.) Filene’s department store business was sold to the May Department Stores Company in 1988, while Filene’s Bargain Basement was purchased by Value City Department Stores, Inc. (renamed Retail Ventures, Inc.), in 2000.
