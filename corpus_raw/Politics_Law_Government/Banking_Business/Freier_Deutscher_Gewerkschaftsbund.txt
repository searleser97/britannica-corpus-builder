Freier Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund (FDGB), (German: “Free German Trade Union Association”)  East German trade union federation.
Controlled by the Socialist Unity Party, the FDGB was formed shortly after World War II with virtually compulsory membership. With the rapid reduction of private enterprise in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany, the trade unions dropped their original function of representing the workers’ interests as against the employers’ and instead became agents for the administration of social insurance, for the organization of technical training and political instruction, and for ensuring fulfillment of labour quotas under state economic plans. In 1955 FDGB statutes were amended to eliminate the right to strike and reduce the federation to an instrument of the Socialist Unity Party.
