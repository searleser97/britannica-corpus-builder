Napster,  file-sharing computer service created by American college student Shawn Fanning in 1999. Napster allowed users to share, over the Internet, electronic copies of music stored on their personal computers. The file sharing that resulted set in motion a legal battle over digital rights and the development of digital rights management software to prevent computer copyright piracy.
The arrival of Napster in 1999 marked the emergence of decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) sharing of music over the Internet. At its peak in 2001 there were as many as 1.5 million people simultaneously sharing files worldwide by using Napster’s software to find and connect with one another, and Napster had embedded in the consciousness of consumers the idea of downloading songs from the Internet—bypassing the purchase of established distribution forms, such as records, tapes, or compact discs (CDs).
Napster was shut down in 2001 (see cybercrime: File sharing and piracy) after a successful court injunction was granted to the Recording Industry Association of America, but the idea that songs could be downloaded, stored, and shared through networked computers had clearly caught on.
Roxio, Inc., an American computer software company, acquired the assets of Napster in 2002, and the following year Roxio relaunched Napster as a legitimate e-commerce enterprise that sold digital music files. In 2004 Roxio changed its corporate name to Napster to strengthen the identification with its music Web site. In 2008 Napster was acquired by the Best Buy Company, Inc., a U.S.-based retailer of electronic products.
