Cohong, Chinese (Pinyin) gonghang or (Wade-Giles romanization) kung-hang, also called hong or cong-hong,  the guild of Chinese merchants authorized by the central government to trade with Western merchants at Guangzhou (Canton) prior to the first Opium War (1839–42). Such firms often were called “foreign-trade firms” (yanghang) and the merchants who directed them “hong merchants” (hangshang).
In existence by the mid-17th century, these merchants theoretically numbered 13 but frequently totaled no more than 4. A system was established in the 1740s that required each foreign ship arriving at Guangzhou to be supervised by a hong merchant, who would guarantee to the Chinese government the payment of all duties and the proper behaviour of the foreign traders. When Guangzhou became the only Chinese port open to foreign trade (1757), the hong merchants were the only merchants in Guangzhou who were permitted to sell tea and silk to the Westerners. Although the hong merchants were subject to heavy exactions from officials, a few, such as Howqua (also called Wu Bingjian), accumulated great wealth.
From 1720 to 1722 the hong merchants established a system of collective price-fixing, which required the taking of a blood oath, as practiced by the Chinese merchant guilds. Under the leadership of the Hoppo, the director of the Guangzhou maritime customs, the hong merchants formed the gonghang (1760). Although the term gonghang connoted a price-fixing association, its pidgin English corruption, cohong, applied to the merchants in a general sense. Though the hong merchants collectively enjoyed their monopoly of the foreign trade at Guangzhou, they were actually quite independent in their dealings.
