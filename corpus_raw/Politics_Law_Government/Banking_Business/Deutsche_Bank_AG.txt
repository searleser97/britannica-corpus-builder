Deutsche Bank AG,  German banking house founded in 1870 in Berlin and headquartered since 1957 in Frankfurt am Main. One of the world’s largest banks, it has a number of foreign offices and has acquired controlling interests in several foreign banks in Europe, North and South America, and Australia.
The first bank was licensed by King William I of Prussia on March 10, 1870, and it began operation in Berlin on April 9. Branches were opened in Bremen in 1871, in Hamburg, Shanghai, and Yokohama, Japan, in 1872, and in London in 1873. By the end of the century, it had absorbed a number of other German banks and multiplied its capital about 10-fold under its managing director Georg von Siemens. More mergers were capped in 1929 by the amalgamation of Deutsche Bank with its older rival, DiscontoGesellschaft. After experiencing difficulties at the onset of the Great Depression, the company prospered hugely under the Nazi regime.
With the collapse of the Third Reich, Deutsche Bank’s offices in Berlin and eastern Germany were closed by the Russian occupation forces or were expropriated; branches in western Germany were “decartelized,” coalescing in 1947–48 as 10 independent banks. As the Cold War progressed and as the economic growth and cooperation of what by then was West Germany became a priority, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization reduced its opposition to West German economic consolidation. By 1952 the 10 banks had been reduced to 3; and in 1957 the 3 successor institutions were reunited to form a single Deutsche Bank AG. The bank made several significant acquisitions in the 1990s, including U.S.-based Bankers Trust. Its primary interests are in Europe, and it has additional operations in Asia, North America, and South America. By the early 21st century, it served more than 12 million customers in more than 70 countries.
