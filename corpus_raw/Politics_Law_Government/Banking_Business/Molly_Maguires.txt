Molly Maguires,  secret organization of coal miners supposedly responsible for acts of terrorism in the coalfields of Pennsylvania and West Virginia, U.S., in the period from 1862 to 1876. The group named itself after a widow who led a group of Irish antilandlord agitators in the 1840s. When poor working conditions and employment discrimination led to assassinations and acts of sabotage by Irish-American workers in Pennsylvania 20 years later, the “Mollies” were blamed. The Ancient Order of Hibernians, a local Irish fraternal association, was thought to be a front for the Molly Maguires, and mine owners hired the Pinkerton National Detective Agency, which sent James McParland to infiltrate the group. In a series of sensational trials in 1875–77, McParland’s testimony resulted in the conviction and hanging of 10 men for murder. The court convictions, adverse publicity, and more prosperous times effected a subsequent decline of violence in the coalfields.
