Telecom Italia SpA,  Italian telecommunications company that is the leading provider of telephony and Internet service in Italy. Headquarters are in Rome.
Telecom Italia provides fixed and wireless telephony in Italy, with the latter being offered through Telecom Italia Mobile SpA (TIM), of which the company owns a majority stake. Telecom Italia offers data transmission services, local and long-distance calling, satellite communications, and teleconferencing services. It is also the dominant Internet service provider in Italy. Through its subsidiary TIM, Telecom Italia operates in foreign markets, especially in Europe (Greece and Turkey) and Latin America (Brazil).
Telecom Italia, incorporated in 1908, became a state-run telecommunications monopoly when in 1933 Benito Mussolini decided to nationalize the telecommunications industry. In 1999 Olivetti & C. SpA acquired 55 percent of the company. The merger between the two companies was finalized in 2003. In the early 21st century, Telecom Italia began to emphasize international expansion of its services, particularly its Internet and broadband offerings.
