European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD),  organization established in 1991 to develop a private business sector in the countries of central and eastern Europe after the collapse of communism in the region. The EBRD provides project financing for banks, industries, and businesses in the private sector. It also works to improve municipal services, promote entrepreneurship, develop stronger financial institutions and legal systems, and restructure and privatize state-owned businesses. The EBRD is one of the largest investors in the region.
The EBRD is owned by many countries and intergovernmental institutions, including the European Union, the European Investment Bank, and foreign partners such as the United States, Japan, Canada, and Australia. One feature of the bankâ€™s operation is its commitment to environmentally sound economic development, which it implements by integrating environmental considerations into its projects and building partnerships to address regional and global environmental issues. Another mandate of the EBRD is to provide investment capital only to those countries that demonstrate a commitment to democratic principles. The main forms of financing used by the EBRD include loans, equity investments, and guarantees. Its headquarters are in London.
