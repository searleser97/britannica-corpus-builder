Preanger system, Dutch Preanger Stelsel,  revenue system introduced in the 18th century in Preanger (now Priangan) of western Java (now part of Indonesia) by the Dutch East India Company and continued by the Dutch until 1916. In this system the company required its regents to deliver specified annual quotas of coffee but levied no other taxes in the region. The regents were free to exact traditional tribute in rice and labour services from the people.
Under this system, Preanger became the centre of coffee production and brought great profits to the Dutch. The regents also prospered through commissions from the sale of coffee, which remained Javaâ€™s most valuable export through the mid-19th century.
