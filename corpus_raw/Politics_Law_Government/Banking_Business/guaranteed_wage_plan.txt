Guaranteed wage plan,  system by which an employer ensures a minimum annual amount of employment or wages (or both) to employees who have been with the employer for a required minimum period of time. The United States has had more experience than other countries with such plans, which are meant to eliminate the adverse effects of fluctuating employment on living standards. The most successful examples have been found in the consumer goods industries, which appear to be affected less by fluctuations in the economy.
When such plans were introduced in the late 19th century, they were usually undertaken unilaterally by employers. They were also extended on an informal basis to a few selected employees, to whom a minimum amount of employment was guaranteed. The plans received some support during the 1930s, when governments tried to encourage them indirectly through labour legislation.
After World War II, guaranteed wage plans reemerged as elements in labourâ€™s collective bargaining proposals. Trade unions viewed them as a means of shifting the risk of unemployment from the worker to the firm. During the 1950s, such plans were favoured not only as a protection against seasonal fluctuations in employment but also as a means of protecting against the job loss that was thought to accompany the introduction of automated equipment. Later plans provided for the integration of payments by private employers with public unemployment-compensation benefits.
In 1982 the Ford Motor Company and the United Automobile Workers union negotiated a new model for such plans. Known as the guaranteed income stream (GIS), this plan was designed to guarantee employees 50 percent of their hourly rate of pay until age 62. GIS programs were widely used during the economic slump of the early 1980s, when many labour settlements used it to provide income stability to workers in the auto, steel, airline, and other industries.
