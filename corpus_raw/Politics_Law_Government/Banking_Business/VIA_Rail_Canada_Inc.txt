VIA Rail Canada, Inc.,  Canadian state-owned passenger-railway system. Incorporated in 1977 and established in 1978 as a crown corporation independent of the Canadian National (CN) and Canadian Pacific (CP) railroads, VIA gradually assumed full responsibility for managing all the country’s rail-passenger services except commuter lines and some small local lines. Headquarters are in Montreal.
After World War II, Canadian rail-passenger service fell off owing to competition from airplanes and automobiles, and much of the rolling stock became outdated, leading to inefficient and costly service. VIA was formed in the hope that it would permit an economy of scale not possible when the CN and CP railroads ran independent passenger services, thereby reducing the subsidies needed to support Canada’s rail-passenger system.
The government acquired ownership of all CN and CP passenger locomotives but did not purchase any track; instead, it compensates the railroads for the cost of operating VIA trains over their tracks. Since VIA’s inception, the government has cut costs by reducing VIA’s routes and frequency of service—most dramatically in 1990, when its operations were cut by about half. In the early years of the 21st century, however, the Canadian government increased VIA’s annual subsidy and committed roughly $1 billion (Canadian) to fleet modernization, track improvements, and other capital developments.
