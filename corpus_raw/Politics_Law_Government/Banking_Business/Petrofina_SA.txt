Petrofina SA,  former Belgian petroleum conglomerate that was acquired in 1999 by Total, a French oil firm, to create Totalfina. The original company was organized in 1920 as the Compagnie Financière Belge des Pétroles (“Belgian Petroleum Finance Company”), with its initial interest in the development of Romanian oil fields and of Belgian interests in Africa. It assumed the name Petrofina SA in 1957 and for much of the 20th century engaged in the exploration for and production of crude oil, oil refining, and petrochemical production. Its gasoline was sold under the brand name Fina.
Until 1962 the company’s main efforts were directed toward petroleum distribution and refining and to establishing associated companies in the United States and Canada. After 1962 Petrofina showed increasing interest in manufacturing petrochemicals, and the company became one of the world’s largest ethylene producers. With petrochemical manufacturing facilities in Belgium and the United States, Petrofina produced polypropylene, polystyrene, and related products as well as paints and varnishes, fatty acids, emulsifiers and detergents, plastics, and materials for road construction. It remained an integrated petroleum company, engaging in exploration, production, refining, and distribution of fuels and oil products, particularly in the North Sea and North America. It sold much of its petroleum output through its own Fina retail outlets.
