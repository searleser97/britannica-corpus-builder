Escalator clause,  provision in union or business contracts for automatic adjustment of wages or prices in proportion to changes in an external standard, such as the U.S. cost of living index. Escalator clauses have been used most extensively since World War II. They are used in union contracts as a means of protecting workers against losses in purchasing power due to inflation. Such wage-adjustment or cost-of-living provisions, however, have been criticized as themselves contributing to inflation, particularly at times when governments are seeking to stabilize prices. Because of this belief, the governments of many countries (e.g., France, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, and Finland) have taken measures prohibiting or restricting automatic wage adjustments.
