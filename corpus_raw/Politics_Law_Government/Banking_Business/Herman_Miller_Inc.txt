Herman Miller, Inc.,  American furniture company known for innovations in design and in organizational management.
In 1923 D.J. DePree joined with his father-in-law, Herman Miller, and other investors to purchase the Star Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan (the company was later named for Miller). By the 1930s DePree had become interested in how contemporary design could improve home and office furniture. To create new products he enlisted leading designers such as Isamu Noguchi, George Nelson, and Charles and Ray Eames (creators of the Eames lounge chair). Well before the New York school of the 1940s showcased American painting as a Modernist vanguard, Herman Miller was already influencing Modernist designs across the globe.
In the 1960s Herman Miller designer Robert Propst devised the open-plan office space, which was based on rows of cubicles. The concept became a business standard. The company became a leader in human-factors engineering (ergonomics), first developing the Ergon work chair in 1976.
The firm was also an early pioneer in participative management, an approach popularized by such social scientists as Rensis Likert. In 1950 Herman Millerâ€™s employees were given opportunities to structure their workloads and comment on corporate decision making, and in 1983 the company introduced an employee stock-ownership program. In the 1990s the company adopted value-based management practices as a means of involving all employees in measuring performance, raising productivity, and strengthening the value of the company.
