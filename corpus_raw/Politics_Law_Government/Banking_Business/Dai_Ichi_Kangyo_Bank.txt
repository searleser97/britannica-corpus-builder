Dai-Ichi Kangyō Bank,  one of three Japanese banks that merged in 2000 to create the Mizuho Financial Group. Once one of the largest commercial banks in Japan, with branches there and operations in 30 other countries, Dai-Ichi had been established in 1971 through the merger of Dai Ichi Bank Ltd. (founded in 1873) and Nippon Kangyō Bank Ltd. (founded in 1897).
Among the businesses the bank developed were commercial banking services, bond underwriting, financing and advisory services, and international services, including Eurocurrency markets. The September 2000 merger with Fuji Bank and the Industrial Bank of Japan led to the formation of the Mizuho Financial Group, one of the world’s largest banking and financial institutions.
