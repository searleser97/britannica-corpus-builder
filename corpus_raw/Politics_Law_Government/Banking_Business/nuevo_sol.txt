Nuevo sol, (Spanish: “new sun”)  monetary unit of Peru. It is divided into 100 centimos. The sol was introduced as the currency of Peru in the 1860s, but it was replaced during Chile’s occupation of the country. It was reintroduced in the 1930s, but in the mid-1980s, when the country suffered severe inflation, it was replaced by the inti. In 1991 the inti was replaced by the nuevo sol at a rate of 1 million inti to 1 nuevo sol. The Central Reserve Bank of Peru (Banco Central de Reserva del Perú) has the exclusive authority to issue banknotes and coins in the country. Coins are issued in denominations ranging from 5 centimos to 5 nuevos soles. Banknotes are denominated in values from 10 to 200 nuevos soles. The obverse of the notes is adorned with the image of a historical figure; examples include diplomat and historian Raúl Porras Barrenechea (20-nuevo sol note), writer and poet Abraham Valdelomar Pinto (50-nuevo sol note), and St. Rose of Lima (200-nuevo sol note), the patron saint of Peru and all of South America.
