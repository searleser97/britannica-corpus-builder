Comparable worth, also called sex equity or pay equity,  in economics, the principle that men and women should be compensated equally for work requiring comparable skills, responsibilities, and effort.
In the United States the concept of comparable worth was introduced in the 1970s by reformers seeking to correct inequities in pay for occupations traditionally held by men and women. Following Congressional passage of the Equal Pay Act (1963), which required that men and women receive “equal pay for equal work,” wages for occupations dominated by women continued to lag behind those for predominantly male occupations. Skeptics say that the concept of comparable worth interferes with the operation of a free market and that the worth of an occupation is not absolute and cannot be compared.
Lawsuits have brought the issue of comparable worth to political prominence. In State of WashingtonAmerican Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees v.  (1981), the state of Washington was ordered to provide raises and compensatory back pay to female state employees, who were found to be earning 20 percent less than their male coworkers. Although the decision was overturned on appeal, the state of Washington agreed to make women’s wages equal to those paid to men. Pay equity laws have been enacted in Europe, Canada, Australia, and in a number of states and municipalities in the United States.
