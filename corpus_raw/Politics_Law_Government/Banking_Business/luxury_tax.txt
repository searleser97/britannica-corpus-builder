Luxury tax,   excise levy on goods or services considered to be luxuries rather than necessities. Modern examples are taxes on jewelry and perfume. Luxury taxes may be levied with the intent of taxing the rich, as in the case of the late 18th- and early 19th-century British taxes on carriages and manservants; or they may be imposed in a deliberate effort to alter consumption patterns, either for moral reasons or because of some national emergency. In modern times, the revenue productivity of luxury taxes has probably overshadowed the moral argument for them. Furthermore, the progressive nature of the early taxes began to be lost as more lower-income people’s “luxuries” were taxed in the interest of generating additional revenue; an example is the amusement tax. To avoid moralistic implications, economists now identify as necessities any goods with low demand elasticity, which include such “luxuries” as tobacco and beer.
