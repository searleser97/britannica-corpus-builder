Vanderbilt family,  one of the wealthiest and most prominent families in the United States. The third generation of Vanderbilts—following Cornelius and William Henry Vanderbilt—was led by three of William Henry’s four sons: Cornelius (1843–99), William Kissam (1849–1920), and George Washington (1862–1914). Of the three, Cornelius was by far the most devoted to furthering the family’s business and investment interests. Following his father’s death in 1885, Cornelius took charge of the various railroads and other corporations and of the philanthropic activities. He served on numerous social and civic boards, and he oversaw the granting of enormous sums to Yale University, Columbia University’s College of Physicians and Surgeons, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and many other educational, charitable, and religious organizations.
William Kissam Vanderbilt worked with his brother Cornelius in managing the Vanderbilt investments and enterprises. But he was far less interested in business than were his brother, father, and grandfather. In 1903 William Kissam turned over management of the railroads to an outside firm and thereafter devoted himself to his philanthropic, social, and sporting interests. He was deeply involved in the operation of the Metropolitan Opera, in collecting art, and in racing yachts. In 1895 he retained the America’s Cup for the United States at the helm of Defender.
George Washington Vanderbilt had the least involvement with the family businesses or investments. He created a huge estate, Biltmore, near Asheville, North Carolina, and there carried on extensive experiments in scientific farming, stock breeding, and forestry. He gave large gifts to the New York Public Library, Columbia University, and the American Fine Arts Society.
Of the fourth generation, Cornelius’ son Cornelius III (1873–1942) was a financier. Other sons Alfred Gwynne (1877–1915) and Reginald Claypoole (1880–1925) were noted for their interest in show horses. William Kissam left two sons—William Kissam (1878–1944) and Harold Stirling (1884–1970)—both associated with the New York Central Railroad. Harold Stirling Vanderbilt was also notable as the inventor of the game of contract bridge and as the skilled yachtsman who won the America’s Cup three times.
Cornelius, Jr. (1898–1974), the son of Cornelius III, was a writer who founded a chain of newspapers.
