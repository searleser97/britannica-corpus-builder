Agfa-Gevaert NV,  Belgian corporate group established in 1964 in the merger of Agfa AG of Leverkusen, West Germany, and Gevaert Photo-Producten NV of Mortsel, Belgium. The merger established twin operating companies, one German (Agfa-Gevaert AG) and one Belgian (Gevaert-Agfa NV, which in 1971 became Agfa-Gevaert NV). Long known for its development and production of photographic film and photofinishing equipment, Agfa sold its consumer film and photofinishing business in 2004. Its core businesses comprise medical imaging technology, microfilm and motion-picture film, document-management systems, and commercial prepress services such as the preparation of graphics for product labels, billboards, or magazines.
Agfa, an abbreviation for Aktiengesellschaft für Anilinfabrikation (“Corporation for Aniline Manufacture”), was founded as a dye company in 1867 at Rummelsburger See near Berlin; it began producing photographic film in 1908. From 1925 to 1945 it was a part of the German cartel IG Farben; in 1951 it became a partly owned subsidiary of Bayer AG, one of the successors to IG Farben.
The history of Gevaert began in 1890, when Lieven Gevaert (1868–1935) started manufacturing photographic paper in Antwerp. In 1920 the company he founded became Gevaert Photo-Producten NV.
Two of the group’s principal factories—located in Leverkusen (near Cologne), Germany, and Mortsel (near Antwerp), Belgium—produce photographic film and equipment, audiotape, and photocopying and duplicating systems. The group also has subsidiaries and production plants in other western European countries, the United States, Latin America, Japan, China, Australia, and New Zealand, as well as distributors worldwide. Bayer AG held a controlling interest in the group from 1981 until 1999, when Agfa’s stock shares were publicly listed. Bayer sold its remaining interest in the company in 2002.
