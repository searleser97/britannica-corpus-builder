Thomson Corporation,  Canadian publishing and information services company. Its specialty reporting covers the fields of law, business and finance, medicine, taxation, and accounting.
Although it is a publicly traded company, much of the stock is controlled by descendants of Roy Thomson, who, in the early 20th century, had acquired a number of Canadian newspapers, radio stations, and magazines. When Thomson moved to Scotland in 1954 to oversee the management of media properties there, his son Kenneth took over management of the Canadian interests, which by the 1960s included educational and trade publishing. By the time of Roy Thomsonâ€™s death in 1976, his company had sold interests in radio and television stations, but it owned more than 100 newspapers in the United States and Canada. In the 1990s the company moved out of general newspaper publishing to develop new products and services in business information and specialty publishing.
