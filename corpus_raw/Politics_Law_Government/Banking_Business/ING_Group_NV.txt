ING Group NV, Dutch ING Groep NV,  global financial institution of Dutch origin that provides services in banking, insurance, and asset management. It is the Netherlands’ largest financial services company. Headquarters are in Amsterdam.
ING Group was created as Internationale Nederlanden Groep (“International Netherlands Group”) one year after the restrictions on mergers between insurers and banks were lifted in 1990 and was the result of a merger between the insurance company Nationale-Nederlanden (formed by a merger between Nationale Levensverzekering-Bank and De Nederlanden van 1845) and the banking company NMB Postbank Groep (formed in 1986 from the merger between NMB Bank and Postbank). Following the merger, ING Group experienced a decade of rapid growth, mainly through autonomous expansion, although it also made significant international acquisitions. Prominent examples of the latter were the U.K. investment bank and asset-management firm Barings (1995), the U.S. insurer Equitable of Iowa Companies (1997), the German bank BHF (1999), and the Mexican insurer Seguros Comercial América (2001).
In the early 21st century ING Group continued to engage in a series of sales and acquisitions, maintaining a strong international presence. In 2009, due to increasing pressure from the European Commission’s antitrust regulators, ING Group initiated a split between its banking and insurance operations.
