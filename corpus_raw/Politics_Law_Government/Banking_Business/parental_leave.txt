Parental leave,  employee benefit that provides job-protected leave from employment to care for a child following its birth or adoption. It is usually available to both mothers and fathers.
Parental leave entitlements vary around the world. Some countries define parental leave as a nontransferable individual right. Each parent is entitled to a certain set amount of leave. Others afford an individual parent the ability to transfer his or her allotted leave to the other parent. Parental leave may also be defined as a family right, allowing parents to divide up the total leave time at their own discretion. Entitlements may consist of a combination of family and individual rights as well. Furthermore, in some countries, parental leave supplements maternity leave, paternity leave, or both. Substantial extensions to parental leave periods known as home care or child care leave may also be granted. However, elsewhere, parental leave replaces maternity leave, paternity leave, or both. Compensation during these periods varies greatly.
How parental leave is defined has a significant effect on the number of mothers and fathers who take parental leave—this is known as the “take-up” rate. The take-up rate for fathers is notably higher in those countries where parental leave is paid. Advocates of gender equality in family caregiving maintain that such policies are necessary to make parity in parenting a tenable proposition.
