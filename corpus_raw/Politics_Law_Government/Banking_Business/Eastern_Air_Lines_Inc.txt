Eastern Air Lines, Inc.,,   former American airline that served the northeastern and southeastern United States.
Founded by Harold Frederick Pitcairn (1897–1960) in 1928 as Pitcairn Aviation, Inc., the company was sold the following year and became Eastern Air Transport, one of the nearly four dozen divisions of North American Aviation, Inc. On March 29, 1938, it was incorporated as an independent company under its current name and sold for $3,500,000 to the former World War I ace Edward V. Rickenbacker and some associates. Rickenbacker, having been general manager for Eastern from January 1935, became president (1938–59). The airline flourished over the years and, in the 1970s and early ’80s, acquired a number of other airlines. Eastern had its major operations along the East Coast of the United States and flew many travelers from the northeastern states to Florida, the Caribbean, and South America.
By the mid-1980s Eastern began suffering financial reverses, and in 1986 the airline was taken over by Texas Air Corporation. Mismanagement continued, and in 1989 Eastern’s profitable northeastern shuttle service was sold, a series of large-scale union strikes began, and the company went into bankruptcy. In 1990 a U.S. federal bankruptcy court removed control from Texas Air and appointed a trustee to run Eastern Air Lines. Despite these changes, Eastern was forced into liquidation in 1991.
