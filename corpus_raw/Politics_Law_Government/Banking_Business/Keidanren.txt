Keidanren, abbreviation of Keizai Dantai Rengōkai, English Federation of Economic Organizations,  Japanese association of business organizations that was established in 1946 for the purpose of mediating differences between member industries and advising the government on economic policy and related matters. It is considered one of the most powerful organizations in Japan.
Created as part of a postwar effort to reorganize the business sector of Japanese society, Keidanren initially had little influence. It subsumed the functions of the Japanese Industrial Council in 1952, a measure that both expanded its ranks and increased its influence. Keidanren was an important force in the creation of Japan’s Liberal-Democratic Party in 1955, and it has effected a number of other changes in Japanese society. Since 1975, however, the association’s influence has suffered from the stricter regulation of political contributions, as well as from the increasingly multinational character of many Japanese businesses.
The association represents some 800 corporations and includes among its membership a diversified group of industries such as mining, finance, and transportation. It has a complex internal structure composed of several consulting agencies and permanent committees that advise the government on such matters as trade policies and space exploration. The organization also conducts unofficial international economic conferences.
