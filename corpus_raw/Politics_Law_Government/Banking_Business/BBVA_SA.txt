BBVA SA, abbreviation of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria,  Spanish financial group with its strength lying in the traditional business of retail banking, asset management, insurance, private banking, and wholesale banking. Headquarters are in Madrid.
BBVA is the result of the 1999 merger of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV) and Banco Argentaria. BBV was formed in 1988 from the merger between Banco de Bilbao (founded 1857) and Banco de Vizcaya (1901). Banco Argentaria was established in 1998 as a federated bank after the amalgamation of Banco Hipotecario (1872), Banco Exterior (1929), and Caja Postal (1909).
BBVA has investments in Spanish industrial companies, especially energy companies. In addition to its operations in Spain, BBVA has a strong international presenceâ€”for example, in Latin America. In the early 21st century BBVA continued its global expansion, engaging in a series of acquisitions, particularly in the United States and Asia. It subsequently began integrating its retail banks under the BBVA brand to present a uniform image and customer experience.
