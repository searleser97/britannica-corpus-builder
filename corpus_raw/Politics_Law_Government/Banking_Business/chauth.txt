Chauth,  in 17th- and 18th-century India, a levy of one-fourth of the revenue demand (or actual collection) of a district from which the Marathas claimed rights of passage or overlordship. The name was derived from the Sanskrit word meaning “a fourth.”
In practice, chauth was often the fee paid by Hindu or Muslim rulers to induce the Marathas either to refrain from molesting their territories or to retire from a district that they had invaded. The Marathas claimed that it was a payment that involved, in return, protection from other attacks, but few princes, Hindu or Muslim, saw its incidence in this light. Since rulers always tried to collect their revenue in full, this impost, in addition to the regular revenue demand, was regarded as oppressive. It did much to make the Marathas unpopular throughout India, among Hindus and Muslims alike.
