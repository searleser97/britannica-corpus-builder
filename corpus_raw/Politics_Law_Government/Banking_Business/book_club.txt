Book club,   marketing service whereby potential book buyers subscribe to free periodicals describing available books, which are sold by order or by “negative option” (see below) and then distributed by mail.
The first book club, established in Germany (1919), reprinted and distributed classics. In the United States the Book-of-the-Month Club (1926) and the Literary Guild (1927) were the first such enterprises, the former distributing more than 200,000,000 new copies of fiction and nonfiction in its first 40 years, especially to areas where there were few bookstores. Book clubs—and similar marketing ventures patterned after them—usually use a technique called negative option, whereby the subscriber must exercise his right to refuse the offered special of the month by returning a refusal notice by mail; otherwise, the book is shipped and the subscriber billed automatically.
By the 1980s nearly 100 book clubs existed in the United States, most of them specialized. The larger general clubs select books judiciously, encouraging business by offering premiums to faithful subscribers, and reducing costs and prices both by marketing large editions and by printing their own editions from publishers’ plates. Specialty book clubs cater to particular interests, e.g., psychology, law, religion, mystery stories, history, politics, gardening, and books for younger readers. A common incentive for attracting new members is the offer of several free or heavily discounted books; long-standing members often receive bonuses of books.
