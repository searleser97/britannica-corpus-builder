Art Rupe, a graduate of the University of California, Los Angeles, started out by recording local black artists for the jukebox market. He soon built a strong roster of small combos led by Roy Milton and brothers Jimmy and Joe Liggins as well as gospel groups such as the Soul Stirrers and the Pilgrim Travelers.  Specialty scored three of the biggest rhythm-and-blues hits of the early 1950s with “Please Send Me Someone to Love” by Percy Mayfield (1950), “Lawdy Miss Clawdy” by Lloyd Price (1952), and “The Things That I Used to Do” by Guitar Slim (1954), the last two recorded in New Orleans, Louisiana, with musicians from Fats Domino’s session band. When Rupe added Little Richard to his roster in 1955, newly appointed artists-and-repertoire man Robert (“Bumps”) Blackwell went to New Orleans for the label’s first session with Richard, which resulted in “Tutti Frutti.”
Richard turned out to be Specialty’s biggest artist. Rupe missed a chance for even greater success with Sam Cooke. The young lead singer of the Soul Stirrers recorded “You Send Me” at Specialty’s studio under the supervision of Blackwell, but an unconvinced Rupe (determined not to lose his gospel star to secular music) terminated the contracts of both singer and producer. Rupe then watched ruefully as the single topped the pop charts on another local label, Keen, and Cooke emerged as one of the biggest artists of the era. The scrupulous Rupe stayed in business for several more years but was never comfortable with the practice of payola (paying disc jockeys to play his records).
