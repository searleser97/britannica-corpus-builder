Harrods,  renowned department store in London. It is located on Brompton Road, south of Hyde Park, in the borough of Kensington and Chelsea.
Henry Charles Harrod founded it as a grocery store in 1849. The enterprise expanded in the late 1800s, and many new departments were added. The store’s owners expanded customer service to provide for every need and once boasted that Harrods had “the best circulating library in London.” Using the store’s services, customers could buy theatre tickets, make travel reservations, and arrange funerals.
Over the years Harrods made innovations in many areas of store operation. In 1884 cash desks were placed at convenient points to take customers’ payments; up to that point most large retailers had used mechanical devices or runners to move customers’ money and change between counters and a central cash station. The next year the store extended limited credit to approved customers.
The present Harrods building, constructed in 1905, houses roughly 300 departments, 20 restaurants, a bank, and a beauty salon. Although the store still sells gourmet food items, its emphasis is on high-fashion clothing. Known for its zealous customer service, Harrods is considered the best department store in Britain. In 1985 it was bought by Mohamed al-Fayed, who sold Harrods to Qatar Holding in 2010.
