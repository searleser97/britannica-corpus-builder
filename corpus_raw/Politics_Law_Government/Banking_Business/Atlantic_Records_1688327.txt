Formed in 1947 by jazz fans Ahmet Ertegun, son of a Turkish diplomat, and Herb Abramson, formerly the artists-and-repertoire director for National Records, Atlantic became the most consistently successful New York City-based independent label of the 1950s, with an incomparable roster including Joe Turner, Ruth Brown, the Clovers, Ray Charles, Clyde McPhatter and the Drifters, and LaVern Baker.  Apart from Charles none of these singers regularly wrote their own songs, which were provided by freelance writers including Jesse Stone, Rudolph Toombs, and Winfield Scott. Stone was also a vital part of the production team in his capacity as rehearsal coach and session arranger.  Former music journalist Jerry Wexler, who coined the term rhythm and blues while working for Billboard, joined the company in 1953. He was just in time to take part in a golden era when many of the labelâ€™s classic records were recorded at evening sessions in the 56th Street office after the desks had been stacked on top of each other to make room for engineer Tom Dowd to set up his recording equipment. As the roster expanded, Atlantic set a precedent by hiring Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller as producers of records by the Coasters and the Drifters, while Ertegun himself helped launch Bobby Darin as a teen star.
