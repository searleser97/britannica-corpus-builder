Outsourcing,  work arrangement made by an employer who hires an outside contractor to perform work that could be done by company personnel. Outsourcing has been a frequent point of dispute for organized labour. If, for example, an employer has a labour contract with a union, and the outsourced work could be performed by union members, then the union will typically object to such a practice because it takes work away from the unionâ€™s members. Management favours outsourcing, or subcontracting, often to nonunion providers, because these activities can often reduce costs. Outsourcing can also reduce the number of employees in a collective bargaining unit.
