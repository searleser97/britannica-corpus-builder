Sotheby’s, in full Sotheby’s Holdings, Inc., also called (1864–1924) Sotheby, Wilkinson and Hodge and (1924–83) Sotheby and Company,  one of the world’s leading auction firms, founded in London in 1744. It originally handled sales of important manuscripts and library collections, but, beginning in the mid-1950s, it increasingly focused on the sale of art. Headquartered in New York City since the 20th century, Sotheby’s maintains other sales offices and auction rooms worldwide.
The founder, Samuel Baker (died 1778), a London bookseller, held his first auction (under his own name) early in 1744, selling an estate library of 457 books. Establishing the firm in York Street and handling further libraries over the years, he went into partnership with George Leigh in 1767. Upon Baker’s death, his estate was divided between Leigh and a nephew, John Sotheby (1778–1807), whose successors were to move the business to 13 Wellington Street in 1818 and were to lead the company for more than 80 years—until 1861, when the last Sotheby died. The company continued to prosper under a series of partners and in 1917 moved to the present London quarters at 34–35 New Bond Street. Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, Sotheby’s concentrated chiefly on auctioning books, manuscripts, and prints; and, though other collectibles were occasionally offered for sale, paintings and other works of art did not begin to dominate Sotheby’s sales until after World War I. Following World War II, principally under the leadership (1958–80) of its chairman Peter C. Wilson, Sotheby’s became established in New York City and, in 1964, acquired Parke-Bernet Galleries, the premier American auction house (founded 1883).
Throughout its history, Sotheby’s has handled some of the most important manuscripts and library collections that have come up for sale. In the 20th century it acquired a number of estates and was noted for its 19th- and 20th-century paintings, especially by the Impressionists. Sotheby’s aggressive sale of the Goldschmidt collection in 1958, which elicited (for that time) amazingly high prices, has been cited as the event heralding the late 20th-century boom in fine-art selling. One of the most spectacular auctions came three years later, when Rembrandt’s Aristotle Contemplating the Bust of Homer was purchased by New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art for $2.3 million.
In 1983 Sotheby’s was purchased by A. Alfred Taubman, a shopping mall developer who led the company through an era of enormous growth but was convicted in 2002 of organizing a price-fixing scheme with rival auction house Christie’s. He subsequently served time in prison and sold his controlling interest in the company. In 2019 Sotheby’s announced that it had agreed to be acquired by BidFair USA, a company owned by the telecommunications entrepreneur Patrick Drahi. He planned to return Sotheby’s, which had been publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange since 1988, to private ownership.
With offices and auction halls around the world, Sotheby’s also owns businesses involved in real estate, appraisals, restitution, and storage.
