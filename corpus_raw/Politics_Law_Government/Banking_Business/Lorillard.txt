Lorillard, original name P. Lorillard Company,  oldest tobacco manufacturer in the United States, dating to 1760, when a French immigrant, Pierre Lorillard, opened a “manufactory” in New York City. It originally made pipe tobacco, cigars, plug chewing tobacco, and snuff. Tobacco for “roll-your-own” cigarettes was introduced in 1860, and cigarettes were being manufactured by the 1880s. From the 1890s to 1911 it was a part of the giant tobacco trust, the American Tobacco Company (see American Brands, Inc.), but once more became independent when the U.S. Court of Appeals dissolved the trust. The company was acquired by closely held Loews Corporation in 1968.
Lorillard’s chief cigarettes have been Old Gold (introduced in 1926) and Kent (1952).
