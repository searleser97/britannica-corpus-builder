Singer Company,  corporation that grew out of the sewing-machine business founded in the United States by Isaac M. Singer.
The company was incorporated in 1863 as the Singer Manufacturing Company, taking over the business of I.M. Singer & Company, which had been formed to market the sewing machine patented by Singer in 1851. The company assumed the name Singer Company in 1963 and was reorganized as Singer NV in The Netherlands in 2000. In 2004 the sewing business and the Singer trademarks were sold to a private U.S. investment firm, and in 2006 it became part of SVP Worldwide, which combined Singer with Husqvarna Viking and PFAFF, two other major sewing machine producers.
Singer’s original design, which was the first practical sewing machine for general domestic use, incorporated the basic eye-pointed needle and lock stitch developed by Elias B. Howe, who won a patent-infringement suit against Singer in 1854. Singer, however, consolidated enough patents in the field to enable him to engage in mass production, and by 1860 his company was the largest manufacturer of sewing machines in the world.
Singer began to market its machines internationally in 1855 and won first prize at the Paris World’s Fair. The company demonstrated the first workable electric sewing machine at the Philadelphia electric exhibition in 1885 and began mass-producing domestic electric machines in 1910. Singer was also a marketing innovator and was a pioneer in promoting the use of installment payment plans.
Besides sewing machines, the company also manufactured power tools, floor-care products, furniture, and electronics controls. In the late 1970s and ’80s Singer began to diversify into the production of aerospace electronics and other high-technology items.
