Fire insurance,   provision against losses caused by fire, lightning, and the removal of property from premises endangered by fire. The insurer agrees, for a fee, to reimburse the insured in the event of such an occurrence. The standard policy limits coverage to the replacement cost of the property destroyed less a depreciation allowance. Indirect loss, such as that resulting from the interruption of business, are excluded but may be covered under a separate contract. Insurance rates are influenced by the quality of fire protection available where the building is located, the type of building construction, the kind of activity conducted within the building, and the degree to which the building is exposed to losses originating outside it.
Certain kinds of property, such as accounting records, currency, deeds, and securities, are frequently excluded from fire-insurance coverage or are declared uninsurable. Loss from such causes as war, invasion, insurrection, revolution, theft, and neglect by the insured are also customarily excluded. Coverage is suspended if the insured does anything that increases the hazard or if the property is vacant beyond a specified period. The policy may be canceled by either party for any reason, but the insurer must give the insured prior notice of cancellation. The policy may specify in addition that the insurer may replace or rebuild the damaged property rather than make a cash settlement.
