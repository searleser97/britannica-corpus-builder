Blue chip,  stock of a large, long-established, and well-financed company, regarded as a sound investment and usually selling at a high price relative to its earnings. Such companies are known for slow but stable growth in their earnings and dividends and are, therefore, favoured by conservative investors. The term (a reference to blue poker chips, which usually have the highest value) has become a general expression for superior quality or prospects.
