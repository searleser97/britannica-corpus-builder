Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU),  the dominant association and governing body of the trade union movement in Australia, established in May 1927. Membership grew significantly when the Australian Workers’ Union joined the ACTU in 1967. Two other mergers with federations of white-collar unions—the Australian Council of Salaried and Professional Associations (in 1979) and the Council of Australian Government Employee Organisations (in 1981)—brought membership up to about 2.5 million members, or more than three-fourths of all trade union membership in Australia.
Although not formally affiliated with the Australian Labor Party, the ACTU has maintained a close association with it. The union has played a major role in Australian politics and is the recognized representative of organized labour in centralized wage negotiations with business and the federal government. Robert Hawke, who was president of the ACTU from 1970 to 1980, went on to serve as Australian prime minister from 1983 to 1991.
The ACTU’s policy-making body, a biennial congress, is made up of delegates from state branches of the federation (called trades and labour councils) and from affiliated trade unions. The decisions of the ACTU’s 17-member executive body must be ratified by a majority of the state branches before taking effect. The institution of Australia’s Industrial Relations Reform Act in 1993, which was designed to simplify the collective bargaining process, resulted in a decline in ACTU membership.
