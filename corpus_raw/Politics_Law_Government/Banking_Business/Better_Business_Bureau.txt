Better Business Bureau,  any of several American and Canadian organizations formed to protect consumers against unfair, misleading, or fraudulent advertising and selling practices.
Founded in 1912, the Council of Better Business Bureaus, the umbrella organization for the Better Business Bureau (BBB) system of the United States and Canada, is a private nonprofit organization. This type of organization was established when advertising executives realized that fraudulent practices by some advertisers were bringing advertising into public disfavour. In response, these executives formed a National Vigilance Committee to police the industry, with subsidiary organizations formed at the local level. The local organizations became known as Better Business Bureaus. Today, sponsored by all segments of the business community, the BBB investigates and sets standards for business practices, receives complaints of improper practices, and conducts educational campaigns, alerting the public to methods of deceit and fraud in advertising and selling.
