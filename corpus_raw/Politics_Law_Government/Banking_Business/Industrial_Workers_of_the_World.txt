Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), byname Wobblies,  labour organization founded in Chicago in 1905 by representatives of 43 groups. The IWW opposed the American Federation of Labor’s acceptance of capitalism and its refusal to include unskilled workers in craft unions.
Among the founders of the IWW were William D. (“Big Bill”) Haywood of the Western Federation of Miners (WFM), Daniel De Leon of the Socialist Labor Party, and Eugene V. Debs of the Socialist Party. Debs withdrew his support as the group grew more radical.
Prior to the founding of the IWW, members of the WFM had called a series of strikes in Cripple Creek, Colorado (1894), Leadville, Colorado (1896), Coeur d’Alene, Idaho (1899), and Telluride, Colorado (1903). The Cripple Creek strike was halted by state militia in 1904, which prompted the WFM to form the first incarnation of the IWW.
Under Haywood’s leadership, the IWW gained greater prominence as a revolutionary organization dedicated to controlling the means of production by the workers. Its tactics often led to arrests and sensational publicity; when IWW organizer Joe Hill was executed in 1915 on a disputed murder charge, he became a martyr and folk hero for the labour movement. The organization won its greatest victories in the mining and lumbering industries of the Pacific Northwest.
The IWW was the only labour organization to oppose U.S. participation in World War I, which IWW leaders protested by attempting to limit copper production in western states. The federal government responded by prosecuting and convicting some of those leaders under the newly enacted Sabotage and Espionage Acts. In the postwar years, the IWW underwent further scrutiny and prosecution by local officials responding to widespread antiradical sentiments. By 1925 membership in the IWW had dwindled to insignificance.
