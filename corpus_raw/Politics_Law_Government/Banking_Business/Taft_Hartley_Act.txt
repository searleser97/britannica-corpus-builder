Taft–Hartley Act, formally Labor–Management Relations Act,  (1947), in U.S. history, law—enacted over the veto of Pres. Harry S. Truman—amending much of the pro-union Wagner Act of 1935. A variety of factors, including the fear of Communist infiltration of labour unions, the tremendous growth in both membership and power of unions, and a series of large-scale strikes, contributed to an anti-union climate in the United States after World War II. Republican majorities in both houses of Congress—the first since 1930—sought to remedy the union abuses seen as permitted under the Wagner Act.
The Labor–Management Relations Act of 1947, sponsored by Sen. Robert A. Taft (Ohio) and Rep. Fred A. Hartley, Jr. (New Jersey), while preserving the rights of labour to organize and to bargain collectively, additionally guaranteed employees the right not to join unions (outlawing the closed shop); permitted union shops only where state law allowed and where a majority of workers voted for them; required unions to give 60 days’ advance notification of a strike; authorized 80-day federal injunctions when a strike threatened to imperil national health or safety; narrowed the definition of unfair labour practices; specified unfair union practices; restricted union political contributions; and required union officers to deny under oath any Communist affiliations.
The Landrum–Griffin Act of 1959 set further union restrictions, barring secondary boycotts and limiting the right to picket.
