General Foods Corporation,  former American manufacturer of packaged grocery and meat products. Since 1989, General Foods product lines have been sold by Kraft Foods Inc.
The company was incorporated in 1922, having developed from the earlier Postum Cereal Co. Ltd., founded by C.W. Post (1854–1914) in 1895 in Battle Creek, Michigan. After a number of experiments, Post marketed his first product—the cereal beverage called Postum—in 1895. Other profitable products followed, notably Grape Nuts (1897), Post Toasties (1904), and, after Post’s death, Post 40% Bran Flakes (1922). From 1925 to 1929 the Postum company began absorbing other firms: Jell-O Company in 1925; Igleheart Brothers (Swans Down flour) and Minute Tapioca Co. in 1926; Franklin Baker (coconut), Walter Baker (chocolate), and Log Cabin (syrup) in 1927; La France Company (bluing), Maxwell House (coffee), and Calumet (baking powder) in 1928; and Certo (pectin) and Birdseye (frozen foods) in 1929. Several other products eventually came into the organization, such as Sanka coffee (1932), Gaines dog food (1943), Bird’s Custard Powder (1947), Kool-Aid (1953), W. Atlee Burpee garden products (1970), Oscar Mayer & Company meat products (1981), and Entenmann’s Inc. bakery products (1982).
As early as 1908, Post had established foreign operations, including the Canadian Postum Company Ltd., in Windsor, Ontario, and the Grape-Nuts Company Ltd., in London. By the late 20th century General Foods had manufacturing plants in most of western Europe and in such other countries as Japan, Australia, Mexico, Venezuela, and Brazil. In 1985 General Foods Corporation was bought by the holding company Philip Morris Companies, which later merged its operations with those of Kraft.
