National Westminster Bank, byname NatWest,  former British bank holding company with branches and subbranches in the United Kingdom and operations across the world. It was acquired by the Royal Bank of Scotland in 2000.
The organization was formed in 1968 as National Westminster Bank Ltd. to merge two banking groups, National Provincial Bank Ltd. (established in 1833) and Westminster Bank Ltd. (1836). A number of acquisitions and sales of various interests followed in the next decade. The bank became the object of a bidding war between the Royal Bank of Scotland and Bank of Scotland in 1999. After unsuccessful attempts to remain independent, NatWest became part of the Royal Bank of Scotland, which retained the NatWest brand name.
