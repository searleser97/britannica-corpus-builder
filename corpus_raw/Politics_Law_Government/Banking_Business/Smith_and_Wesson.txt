Smith & Wesson,  American firearms manufacturer based in Springfield, Massachusetts. The partnership was first founded in 1852 by Horace Smith (1808–93) and Daniel B. Wesson (1825–1906) in Norwich, Connecticut, to make lever-action Volcanic repeating handguns firing caseless self-consuming bullets.
That venture failed, however, and the two men established a second partnership in 1856 in Springfield to produce small “tip-up” revolvers. Those pistols featured completely bored-through cylinder chambers that were accessed by “tipping” the barrel up at a hinge at the front of the top strap and fired self-contained metallic cartridges—the original .22 rimfire—of Smith and Wesson’s own design. The American Civil War made Smith & Wesson a leading revolver manufacturer. Its introduction in the 1870s of large-frame “break-top” revolvers (“breaking” the revolver at a hinge in front of the trigger guard exposed the rear of the cylinder) that fired more-potent cartridges created business in the American West and around the world.
Smith & Wesson later supplied thousands of swing-out cylinder “hand ejector” revolvers to police forces around the world as well as to the Americans and the British in World War I and the Allies in World War II. During the 20th century the company also developed a number of famed cartridges, including the .357 and .44 magnum rounds. In the mid-1950s Smith & Wesson introduced its first semiautomatic pistol (Model 39), which inaugurated several generations of self-loading handguns.
Ownership of the company changed hands several times beginning in the mid-1960s, and in the 21st century the company operated as the Smith & Wesson Holding Corporation. In addition to a broad array of handgun designs and models, the firm prospered from the sale of ancillary products ranging from knives and flashlights to handcuffs and law-enforcement apparel.
