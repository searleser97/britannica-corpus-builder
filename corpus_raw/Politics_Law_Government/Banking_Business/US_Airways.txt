US Airways, formerly All American Aviation, Inc. (1937–48), All American Airways, Inc. (1948–53), Allegheny Airlines, Inc. (1953–79), and USAir, Inc. (1979–97),  former American airline that was incorporated on March 5, 1937, as All American Aviation, Inc. It underwent numerous name changes before becoming US Airways in 1997. In 2015, two years after announcing plans to merge with American Airlines, the carrier flew its last flight.
The company began service in 1939 as a mail carrier over the mountainous regions of Pennsylvania and West Virginia. It initiated passenger service in 1949 and expanded in subsequent decades to include a network of routes primarily serving cities and towns located in the northeastern quadrant of the United States, from the Midwest to the Atlantic coast. In 1968 the carrier merged with Lake Central Airlines, Inc. (which was founded in 1947 as Turner Airlines and adopted the Lake Central name in 1950), which flew routes radiating from Indianapolis, Indiana. In 1972 it merged with Mohawk Airlines, Inc. (which was founded in 1945 as Robinson Airlines and adopted the Mohawk name in 1952), which flew commuter routes within New York state.
In 1987 the company bought Pacific Southwest Airlines, which had routes along the southern half of the West Coast. A more-important acquisition in the same year was that of Piedmont Aviation, Inc. (founded in 1940), a large airline serving the east-central United States and based in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. US Airways merged with America West Holdings in 2005, with the latter assuming the US Airways name on its flights and equipment. In early 2013 US Airways agreed to merge with American Airlines in a deal that would create the largest U.S. airline. US Airways completed its last flight in October 2015, as the merger was finalized.
