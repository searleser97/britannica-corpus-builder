Ad valorem tax,   any tax imposed on the basis of the monetary value of the taxed item. Literally the term means “according to value.” Traditionally, most customs and excises had “specific” rates; the tax base was defined in terms of physical units such as gallons, pounds, or individual items.
Ad valorem rates, which have come into increased use, have the important advantage of adjusting the tax burden according to the amount the consumer spends on the taxed items. They thus avoid the serious discrimination of specific rates against the low-priced varieties of the commodities. The primary difficulty with the ad valorem taxation, especially in the case of tariffs, is in establishing a satisfactory value figure.
Sales taxes of broad scope must of necessity have ad valorem rates. Property taxes are sometimes considered ad valorem taxes, since the rates are applied to the value of the property, as distinguished from special assessments, which are frequently imposed on a specific unit (e.g., front footage) basis.
