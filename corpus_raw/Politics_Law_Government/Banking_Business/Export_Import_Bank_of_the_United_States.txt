Export-Import Bank of the United States, byname Ex-Im Bank,  one of the principal agencies of the U.S. government in international finance, originally incorporated as the Export-Import Bank of Washington on February 12, 1934, to assist in financing the export of American-made goods and services. Its name was changed in 1968. Ex-Im Bank’s headquarters are in Washington, D.C., but most operations are handled through seven regional centres.
The bank’s principal programs include direct long-term loans, credit and working capital guarantees (principally to commercial banks), short-term and medium-term loans, credit insurance, financing for the purchase of aircraft, and financing for environmental, nuclear, and other special projects. Most bank assistance has consisted of direct financing to buyers abroad of American goods and services. This assistance has taken the form of long-term credits to public or private entities for the purchase and export of capital equipment and related services, credits to foreign lending institutions for relending to local enterprises, credits to countries suffering temporary dollar shortages to maintain the flow of U.S. trade, and agricultural commodity credits. Through these programs the bank has participated in economic development projects in developing countries. In recent years it has fostered the export of environmentally beneficial goods and services and has, in some cases, minimized the effects of trade subsidies set up by other governments. Despite its name, Ex-Im Bank does not finance imports.
The bank’s loans, which are made in dollars and are repayable in dollars, are extended for specific purposes. The bank is required to encourage and supplement private capital but not compete with it. The bank is governed by a board of five directors appointed by the president of the United States. See also development bank.
