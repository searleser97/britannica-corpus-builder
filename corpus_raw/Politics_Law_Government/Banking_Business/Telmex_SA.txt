Telmex SA,  company that owns and operates most of Mexico’s telecommunications system. Headquarters are in Mexico City.
Telmex provides fixed-line telephony services, including long-distance and international calling and Internet access services. It was established in 1990 following the privatization of the state-owned telephone company, which in turn had been formed in the early 20th century when private investors backed by AT&T Corporation and the Swedish telecommunications company Ericsson separately won concessions to operate in Mexico City. After nationalization of the telecommunications industry and openings in the ownership of the company during its early years, the Mexican government bought 51 percent of the company’s shares in 1972. In 1990 the company was privatized, operating mainly under the control of Grupo Carso, owned by the Mexican businessman Carlos Slim Helú.
In the early 21st century Telmex engaged in a series of sales and acquisitions, expanding its international presence. In 2010 a majority share hold in Telmex was acquired by América Móvil—Latin America’s leading mobile-phone company—which had been spun off from Telmex in 2001, although Slim retained ownership of it.
