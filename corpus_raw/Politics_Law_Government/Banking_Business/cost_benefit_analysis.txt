cost-benefit analysis,  in governmental planning and budgeting, the attempt to measure the social benefits of a proposed project in monetary terms and compare them with its costs. The procedure, which is equivalent to the business practice of cost-budgeting analysis, was first proposed in 1844 by the French engineer A.-J.-E.-J. Dupuit. It was not seriously applied until the 1936 U.S. Flood Control Act, which required that the benefits of flood-control projects exceed their costs.
A benefit-cost ratio is determined by dividing the projected benefits of a program by the projected costs. In general, a program having a high benefit-cost ratio will take priority over others with lower ratios. Determining this ratio is a difficult task, however, because of the wide range of variables involved. Both quantitative and qualitative factors must be taken into account, especially when dealing with social programs. For instance, the monetary value of the presumed benefits of a given program may be indirect, intangible, or projected far into the future. The time factor must be considered in estimating costs, especially in long-range planning. Variable interest rates, tying-up of funds, and the disruption of normal cash flow must be factors in the analysis if an accurate benefit-cost ratio is to be determined.
Cost-benefit analyses have been used in all aspects of government planning and budgeting, from programs that can be analyzed with a fairly high degree of accuracy, such as waterworks, to programs that involve a great degree of subjective data, such as military outlays. Critics of cost-benefit analysis argue that reducing all benefits to monetary terms is impossible and that a quantitative economic standard is inappropriate to political decision making.
