Piccolomini Family,   noble family prominent in Sienese politics from the 12th century as leaders of the Guelf (papal) party and as operators of a banking firm with branches in France and England as well as in Italy.
Tracing their origins, according to family legend, to Lars Porsena, king of Clusium, the Piccolomini by the 12th century played an important role in the aristocratic consular commune of Siena. In the 13th century the family reached its commercial apogee, despite being twice banished from their native city, a Ghibelline (imperial) party stronghold. They managed to escape the economic crisis of the 14th century, thanks to large investments in land, and in 1458 were named counts palatine by the Holy Roman emperor Frederick III. The family included soldiers, prelates, literary men, and two popes—Enea Silvio, who became Pius II (1458–64), and his nephew Francesco, who was Pius III (1503).
