Formed in 1950 by Jac Holzman, who initially ran it from his dormitory at St. John’s College, in Annapolis, Maryland, Elektra became one of the top folk labels alongside Vanguard, Folkways, and Prestige.  Simply recorded albums by Jean Ritchie, Josh White, and Theodore Bikel achieved substantial sales without the need for expensive marketing or hit singles, even after Elektra moved to offices on West 14th Street near Greenwich Village. But, while the other labels mostly stuck to traditional notions of folk, Elektra adapted in response to the emergence of folk rock, recording Judy Collins, Tom Rush, and Phil Ochs. By the end of the 1960s it had merged with Warner and Atlantic to form one of the major companies in the recording industry.
Inspired by British reinterpretations of Elektra’s folk repertoire (particularly the Animals’ 1964 version of “House of the Rising Sun,” previously associated with Josh White), artists-and-repertoire man Paul Rothchild encouraged amplified versions of folk and blues. He pulled together the work of various artists in the Blues Project concept album (1964) and signed the Chicago-based Paul Butterfield Blues Band, featuring guitar prodigy Mike Bloomfield. Most prescient of all, he discovered and produced the band that was to become one of the most successful and influential West Coast acts of the era, the Los Angeles-based Doors.
