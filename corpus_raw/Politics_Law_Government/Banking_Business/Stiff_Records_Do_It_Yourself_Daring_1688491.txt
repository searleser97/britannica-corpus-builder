Independent labels have given voice to music otherwise ignored or rebuffed by the major labels. Stiff was set up to record pub rock, yet it prospered because of punk, the style that displaced the pub rock movement. This is but one of several paradoxes associated with that label, which started in 1976 with a loan from pub rockers Dr. Feelgood to Jake Riviera, their manager, and Dave Robinson, the manager of ill-fated pub rockers Brinsley Schwartz. Started on a back street in Bayswater, London, Stiff issued the first punk record, by the Damned, but never signed another punk act. It presented itself as a brave new musical world yet had its first success with Elvis Costello, Ian Dury, and Jona Lewie, former pub rockers who reinvented themselves. Moreover, Stiff started Britain’s do-it-yourself independent label boom but was never comfortable with the anarchic philosophies or brash recordings favoured by most of its successors, such as Beggar’s Banquet’s 4AD, Daniel Miller’s Mute, and Miles Copeland’s Step Forward (the last of which moved quickly from punk to the pop-oriented sound of the Police).
Although Stiff’s early productions were mostly overseen by jack-of-all-trades Nick Lowe, its house style was formed not in the studio but in the marketing department, and Stiff’s look was the creation of accomplished graphic designer Barney Bubbles. An inspired series of singles by Madness in the early 1980s (all accompanied by witty videos directed by Robinson) epitomized the label’s unique flair. But when major labels, which had greater financial resources, realized that success was to be driven by marketing, it transpired that Stiff had provided the blueprint for its own demise in the late 1980s.
