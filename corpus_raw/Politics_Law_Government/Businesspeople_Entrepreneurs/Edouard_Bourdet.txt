Édouard Bourdet,  (born 1887, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France—died  Jan. 17, 1945, Paris), French dramatist noted for his satirical and psychological analyses of contemporary social problems.
Bourdet’s first plays, Le Rubicon (1910) and L’Homme enchaîné (1923; “The Man Enchained”), were not successful. His reputation was secured, however, by La Prisonnière (1926; The Captive), a psychological study of the sufferings of a troubled woman. With Vient de paraître (1928; “Just Appeared”), a satire on the literary world, Bourdet established a formula for the series of satirical comedies that he produced between the world wars. Notable plays in the series are Le Sexe faible (1931; The Sex Fable) and Les Temps difficiles (1934; “The Difficult Times”).
Bourdet served as director of the Comédie-Française from 1936 to 1940. His later plays include Hyménée (1941; “Hymen”) and Père (1943; “Father”).
