Mia Hamm, byname of Mariel Margaret Hamm,  (born March 17, 1972, Selma, Alabama, U.S.), American football (soccer) player who became the first international star of the women’s game. Playing forward, she starred on the U.S. national team that won World Cup championships in 1991 and 1999 and Olympic gold medals in 1996 and 2004. She was revered for her all-around skill, competitive spirit, and knack for goal scoring. She retired from the national team in 2004 with 158 goals in international competition, the most by any player, male or female (her record was broken by countrywoman Abby Wambach in 2013). She was twice named Women’s World Player of the Year (2001–02) by the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA).
Hamm’s goal-scoring talent as a teenager drew attention from top college programs as well as the national team. At age 15 she became the youngest person ever to become a member of the U.S. team. In 1989 Hamm entered the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and, by the time she graduated in 1994, she had helped the Tar Heels win four National Collegiate Athletic Association championships.
Hamm made 276 appearances with the national team. During her career, in addition to winning the four major championships, the U.S. women finished third in the 1995 and 2003 World Cup tournaments and took a silver medal at the 2000 Olympics. With Hamm as the star, they enjoyed media attention unprecedented for a women’s sports team, especially during the 1999 World Cup held in the United States. Jerseys with her number 9 became a top seller, and her popularity, which continued into her retirement, rivaled that of the best-known male athletes.
Hamm also played professionally for the Washington Freedom of the short-lived Women’s United Soccer Association (2001–03). After retiring from competitive play in 2004, she remained involved in the sport. Notably, in 2014 Hamm became a co-owner—along with her husband, former baseball player Nomar Garciaparra, and numerous others—of the Los Angeles Football Club of Major League Soccer; the team began play in 2018.
Hamm cowrote (with Aaron Heifetz) Go for the Goal: A Champion’s Guide to Winning in Soccer and Life (1999).
