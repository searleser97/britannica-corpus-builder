Charles Curran , in full Sir Charles John Curran,  (born October 13, 1921, Dublin, Ireland—died January 9, 1980, Barnet, Hertfordshire, England), British broadcasting administrator best known for his leadership at the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).
Curran was a graduate of Magdalene College, Cambridge. He served in the Indian army during World War II and joined the BBC in 1947 as a producer of informative talks. He left following a dispute, and for a time he edited Canadian Fishing News. In 1951, however, he returned to the BBC to work in its monitoring division, which analyzes mass media worldwide. He later served as the corporation’s secretary (1963–66) and director of external services (1967–69) before succeeding Sir Hugh Greene as director general in 1969. Curran held the position of director general at the BBC until 1977 and served as president of the European Broadcasting Union from 1973 to 1978. During his term as chief executive of the BBC, Curran successfully preserved its independent status in the face of strong political pressures and mounting financial constraints. He was knighted in 1974 and in 1978 became managing director and chief executive of Visnews, an international television news agency. He described his years at the BBC in A Seamless Robe (1979).
