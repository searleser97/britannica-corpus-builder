James Elias Olson,  (born December 3, 1925, Devils Lake, North Dakota, U.S.â€”died April 18, 1988, Short Hills, New Jersey), American business executive and former chief executive officer of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T). He is best known for the vital role he played in restructuring the communications giant after its 1984 divestiture of the Bell telephone companies and in guiding the firm toward financial health by implementing cost cutting and by reorganizing the computer division.
Olson, who spent 44 years with Bell companies, began with a summer job cleaning silt out of telephone manholes and later served as an apprentice cable splicer before earning a degree in commerce in 1950 from the University of North Dakota. He then landed a management position with the company and gained a succession of quick promotions. In 1972 he was appointed president of the Indiana Bell Telephone Co., and two years later he headed the Illinois Bell Telephone Co. He became executive vice president of AT&T in 1977 and in 1979 was elected vice-chairman. In 1984 Olson was named chairman and chief executive officer of AT&T Technologies, and the following year he became president and chief operating officer. During his 20-month tenure as chairman of AT&T, Olson formulated a long-term strategy that, implemented by his dynamic leadership, began to revive the ailing company.
