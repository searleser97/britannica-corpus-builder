Michael Morris, 3rd Baron Killanin,  (born July 30, 1914, London, Eng.—died April 25, 1999, Dublin, Ire.), Irish author and businessman who in 1972 succeeded Avery Brundage as president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), after having served as IOC vice president since 1968.
Morris succeeded his uncle to the title of Baron Killanin in 1927. After attending the Sorbonne (1932) in Paris and Magdalene College in Cambridge (B.A., 1935), Lord Killanin was a war correspondent for the London Daily Express, Daily Mail, and Sunday Dispatch, covering the Sino-Japanese War and writing a political column. When World War II broke out he joined the King’s Royal Rifle Corps; he was awarded the Order of the British Empire for his part in the invasion of Normandy. Lord Killanin served on the board of directors for numerous British corporations. He also produced a number of successful motion pictures (e.g., The Rising of the Moon, 1957; The Playboy of the Western World, 1962) and wrote and edited several books, including Four Days (1938), The Olympic Games (1976), and My Olympic Years (1983).
His association with the Olympic Games was extensive. Lord Killanin was elected president of the Olympic Committee of Ireland in 1950, a representative from Ireland to the IOC in 1952, and an IOC executive board member in 1967. After Brundage retired, Killanin faced the increasingly difficult job of keeping the Olympic Games as free from politics and international strain as possible. He tried to maintain a more flexible attitude about the definition of amateur athletics than that advocated by Brundage. In 1980 he was made honorary life president of the IOC.
