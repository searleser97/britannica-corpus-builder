Asano Sōichirō,   (born 1848, Etchū province, Japan—died  1930, Tokyo), Japanese businessman who founded the giant Asano zaibatsu, or industrial combine.
The son of a physician, Asano chose a career in business, but his first company failed. In 1871 he became a coal merchant in Tokyo. Five years later he developed methods for utilizing coke, until then a waste by-product of gas manufacture, in cement production, and this enterprise prospered. His business acumen interested Shibusawa Eiichi, a leading figure in Meiji era industrial development, who enabled Asano in 1883 to acquire a government cement plant being transferred to private ownership free of charge. It became the Asano Cement Company, cornerstone of the Asano zaibatsu, which eventually included shipping and shipbuilding, mining, gas and electricity, oil, iron and steel, and beer brewing. By 1929 it was the fifth-largest such combine in Japan, with 17 wholly owned companies, 26 subsidiaries, 26 affiliates, and 6 associated concerns. The Allied Occupation authorities broke up the Asano zaibatsu into separate enterprises in 1947.
