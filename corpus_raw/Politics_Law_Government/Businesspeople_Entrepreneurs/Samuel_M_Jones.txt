Samuel M. Jones, in full Samuel Milton Jones, byname Golden Rule Jones,  (born August 3, 1846, Ty Mawr, Wales—died July 12, 1904, Toledo, Ohio, U.S.), Welsh-born U.S. businessman and civic politician notable for his progressive policies in both milieus.
Jones immigrated to the United States with his parents at age three and grew up in New York. At age 18, after very little schooling, he went to work in the oil fields of Titusville, Pennsylvania. Jones rose from field hand to oil producer. His invention of an improved oil-pumping mechanism in 1891 earned him a fortune. He opened a factory in Toledo, Ohio, to manufacture his invention and introduced there a host of employee benefits, including the eight-hour workday, profit sharing, paid vacations, a minimum wage, Christmas bonuses, and recreational facilities.
His guide in dealing with employees, Jones attested, was the Golden Rule, and admirers and critics alike (many businessmen despised him as a supposed socialist) applied that term as his sobriquet. Nominated by the Republican Party and elected in 1897 as mayor of Toledo, he set about governing by the same ideal. He established free kindergartens and playgrounds and free lodging for the homeless, he granted city employees benefits comparable to those his factory workers enjoyed, he sought to root out corruption from city government, and he advocated public ownership of utilities.
In 1899 the Republicans repudiated Jones and nominated a more conventional candidate for the office of mayor. Yet so popular was Jones with the electorate that he captured more than 70 percent of the vote by running as an independent. Reelected in 1901 and again in 1903, he died in office in 1904. In his will, Jones left a $10,000 “Golden Rule Trust” to the workers in his factory.
