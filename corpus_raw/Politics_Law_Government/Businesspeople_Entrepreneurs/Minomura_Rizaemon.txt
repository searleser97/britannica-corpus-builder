Minomura Rizaemon,  (born Nov. 25, 1821, Edo [now Tokyo], Japan—died  Feb. 21, 1877, Tokyo), Japanese businessman responsible for making the house of Mitsui the largest of the zaibatsu (“financial clique”) that dominated the economic life of Japan throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries. Under Minomura’s leadership Mitsui became one of the few financial giants of the Tokugawa period (1603–1867) that were able to make the transition to modern industrial conditions.
An orphan, Minomura worked his way up, eventually becoming an exchange broker and developing close ties with the government. Invited to join the Mitsui firm, the largest exchange brokerage of the time, he soon rose to the top position in that house.
After the Meiji Restoration (1868), which overthrew feudal rule in Japan, Minomura instituted modern banking methods, becoming president of the Mitsui Bank, the first private institution of its type in Japan. He also helped launch Mitsui into other enterprises, laying the foundation for a great industrial empire.
