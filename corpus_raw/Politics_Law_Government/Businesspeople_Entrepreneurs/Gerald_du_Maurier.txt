Sir Gerald du Maurier, in full Sir Gerald Hubert Edward Busson Du Maurier,  (born March 26, 1873, London, Eng.—died  April 11, 1934, London), actor-manager, the chief British exponent of a delicately realistic style of acting that sought to suggest rather than to state the deeper emotions.
A son of the artist and novelist George du Maurier, he won immense popularity, but the fact that he presented characters in terms of his own personality, in contemporary plays, led many to underrate him. Educated at Harrow, du Maurier made his debut in 1894. Among the plays in which he appeared were Sir James Barrie’s Admirable Crichton, Peter Pan, and Dear Brutus. He joined in the management of Wyndham’s Theatre in 1910 and then of the St. James’s in 1925. He was knighted in 1922. He also acted in and produced films.
