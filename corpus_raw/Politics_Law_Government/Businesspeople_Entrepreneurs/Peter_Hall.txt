Peter Hall, in full Sir Peter Reginald Frederick Hall,  (born November 22, 1930, Bury Saint Edmonds, Suffolk, England—died September 11, 2017, London), English theatrical manager and director who held notably successful tenures as director of the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theatre.
Hall produced and acted in amateur productions at the University of Cambridge before receiving his M.A. degree there in 1953. He staged his first professional production in 1953 at the Theatre Royal, Windsor, and subsequently served as assistant director and then director at the Arts Theatre, London (1954–56), where he staged the London premieres of Samuel Beckett’s Waiting for Godot and Jean Anouilh’s The Waltz of the Toreadors, as well as the first play by Eugène Ionesco to be performed in England, The Lesson. He went on to direct plays at various theatres in London and New York City, and in 1960 he became managing director of the Royal Shakespeare Company, which he founded. In 1960 he oversaw the opening of the company’s Aldwych Theatre in London, where his productions included the London premiere of Anouilh’s Becket (1962) and the opening of Harold Pinter’s The Homecoming (1965). He resigned as managing director of the company in 1968 but continued to direct plays for it.
Hall succeeded Laurence Olivier as managing director of the National Theatre in 1973, and three years later he guided the company’s move from the Old Vic theatre to its new home on London’s South Bank. Among the many plays he directed for the  National Theatre were the premieres of Pinter’s No Man’s Land (1975) and Peter Shaffer’s Amadeus (1979). After leaving the directorship of the National Theatre in 1988, Hall formed his own theatrical production company, which he helmed until 2011, when he was diagnosed with dementia. During this time he also cofounded (2003) the Rose Theatre Kingston, serving as its artistic director until 2008. His books on the theatre include Exposed by the Mask: Form and Language in Drama (2000) and Shakespeare’s Advice to the Players (2003).
Hall, especially renowned for his productions of Shakespeare, was also a longtime operatic director in Britain and the United States, and he directed several motion pictures, including The Homecoming (1973). He was knighted in 1977. Hall’s diaries, edited by John Goodwin, were published in 1983 as Peter Hall’s Diaries. Making an Exhibition of Myself (1993) is an autobiography.
