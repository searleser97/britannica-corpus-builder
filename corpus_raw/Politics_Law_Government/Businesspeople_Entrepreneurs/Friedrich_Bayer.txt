Friedrich Bayer,  (born June 6, 1825, Barmen, Rhine province, Prussia [Germany]—died  May 6, 1880, Wurzburg, Ger.), German businessman who founded the chemical firm that became the world-famous Bayer AG (q.v.).
Bayer served an apprenticeship with a firm dealing in chemical products, and he quickly advanced to become the deputy of the owner. He soon established his own business dealing in chemicals and dyewoods and took up the manufacture of dye extracts and dyestuffs. In 1863, together with Friedrich Weskott, Bayer founded a new firm producing triphenylmethane and azo dyestuffs and later also alizarin dyestuffs. At the time of his death, his business supplied chemicals and dyestuffs to textile firms throughout the world, and the foundation for Bayer AG was already laid. After his death the management of the firm was taken over by his son, Friedrich Bayer (1851–1920), and H.T. von Böttinger.
