John Jakob Raskob,  (born March 19, 1879, Lockport, New York, U.S.—died October 15, 1950, Centreville, Maryland), American financier who played a major role in the early 20th-century expansion of E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. and of General Motors Corporation.
From 1898 to 1900, Raskob served as secretary in three firms, ending up serving Pierre Samuel du Pont, president of Johnson Company, which was involved in real estate and Ohio interurban railways. When du Pont became treasurer of E.I. du Pont de Nemours in 1902, Raskob continued as his assistant. Twelve years later, Raskob assumed his mentor’s position as treasurer and was then made a vice president. He and du Pont had taken an interest in the General Motors Corporation, begun in 1908, and by 1915 the two owned enough stock to make du Pont chairman of the board and Raskob a board member. In 1918 he became chairman of the firm’s finance committee.
Under Raskob’s financial leadership, General Motors enjoyed greatly increased sales and earnings. He encouraged a widened stock ownership base in the belief that, as more people bought the company’s stock, more would buy its products. He further stimulated sales by establishing the General Motors Acceptance Corporation (GMAC), which allowed dealers to finance their inventory of cars and offer credit and long-term financing to their customers. Raskob’s influence in the company declined, however, after the recession crisis of 1920 and the appointment that year of du Pont as president.
In 1928 Raskob left General Motors to become chairman of the Democratic National Committee, in which capacity he ran Alfred E. Smith’s unsuccessful campaign for president. After the election Smith and Raskob became directors of the Empire State Building Corporation, overseeing the construction and management of what was the world’s tallest building to date.
