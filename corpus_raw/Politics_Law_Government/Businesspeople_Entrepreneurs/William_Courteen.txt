Sir William Courteen,  Courteen also spelled Courten, or Curteen,  (born 1572, London, Eng.—died May/June 1636, London), English merchant and shipowner noted especially for his enterprises in the West Indies and the East Indies.
The son of a Protestant refugee who had come to London in 1568, Courteen from an early age acted as the agent in Haarlem, Neth., for his father’s silk and linen business. He became senior partner in the merchant house of Courteen and Moncy in 1606. His trade with Europe, Guinea, and the West Indies brought him great wealth, and in 1622 he was knighted. One of his vessels discovered an island which he named Barbados and to which in 1625 he sent colonists. But James Hay, 1st earl of Carlisle, claiming a lease of all Caribbean islands under deeds of 1627 and 1628, seized Barbados in 1629. This entailed heavy losses on Courteen, as did large loans made to Kings James I and Charles I. He also suffered trading failures in the East Indies and long, unsuccessful litigation over the estate with one of his partners. Though still wealthy, he never recovered his former prominence.
