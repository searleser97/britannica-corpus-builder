Henry Ford II,  (born September 4, 1917, Detroit, Michigan, U.S.—died September 29, 1987, Detroit), American industrialist and head of Ford Motor Company for 34 years (1945–79). He is generally credited with reviving the firm.
In 1940 Ford left Yale University without graduating to join the firm founded by his grandfather, Henry Ford, and at the time run by his father, Edsel Ford. A year later he joined the U.S. Navy; but in 1943, following the unexpected death of his father, he was released from duty and became a Ford vice president. After what amounted to a crash course in industrial management, he succeeded to the presidency of the ailing company in 1945.
He promptly set about modernizing the Ford Motor Company and discharged the all-powerful personnel chief Harry Bennett, whose strong-arm union-busting tactics had earned the company a great deal of opprobrium. He brought in a group of talented systems analysts from the U.S. Air Force who became known as the “Whiz Kids,” among them Robert S. McNamara, later to become Ford’s president. One of the cars introduced during Henry II’s tenure, the Edsel, was a legendary failure, but two others, the Mustang and the Thunderbird, were immensely popular and are widely considered to be classics. By the mid-1950s Henry II had restored the company to financial health, and subsequently he greatly expanded Ford’s operations in overseas markets.
