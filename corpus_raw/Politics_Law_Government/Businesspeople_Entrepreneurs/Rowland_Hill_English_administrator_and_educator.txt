Sir Rowland Hill,  (born December 3, 1795, Kidderminster, Worcestershire, England—died  August 27, 1879, Hampstead, London), British administrator and educator, originator of the penny postage system, principally known for his development of the modern postal service, which was subsequently adopted throughout the world.
The son of an English schoolmaster, Hill was interested in problems of teaching; for about 15 years he operated schools in which he emphasized student democracy, rigid self-discipline, and intensive teaching. His wide-ranging interests included printing, astronomy, mathematics, and transportation.
Hill’s proposals for postal reform, formulated between 1835 and 1837, were based on the notion that revenue derived from taxes should increase with the growth of the population and national prosperity. He therefore suggested a lower levy on letters, since high taxes reduced the volume of mail and thus diminished the revenue derived therefrom; a uniform postage rate irrespective of distance, since excessive numbers of rates for letters traveling different distances greatly increased accounting expenses; and that all mail should be prepaid. To effect the last, he proposed a device that subsequently became known as the postage stamp. Hill managed to put his program into effect in 1840, despite bureaucratic hostility. He was knighted in 1860.
