Columbus O’D. Iselin, in full Columbus O’Donnell Iselin,  (born Sept. 25, 1904, New Rochelle, N.Y., U.S.—died  Jan. 5, 1971, Vineyard Haven, Mass.), American oceanographer who, as director of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (1940–50; 1956–57) in Massachusetts, expanded its facilities 10-fold and made it one of the largest research establishments of its kind in the world.
The scion of a New York banking family (his great-grandfather had helped found the Metropolitan Opera House and the Metropolitan Museum of Art), Iselin attended Harvard University (A.B., 1926; A.M., 1928). From 1926 on, he made a series of summer sea excursions toward Labrador and the Arctic with his own schooner and crew, collecting material and data for Harvard’s Museum of Comparative Zoology. For Harvard he served as assistant curator of oceanography (1929–48) and research oceanographer of the Museum of Comparative Zoology. Concurrently, in 1932 he joined the newly established Woods Hole institution and, from 1936, taught oceanography at Harvard.
In 1940 he was named director of Woods Hole and, with wartime funds from the U.S. Navy, vastly increased the institution’s budget and size. Wartime studies—factors in seaborne invasions, ocean currents, underwater explosions, and other matters—turned in 1946 to peacetime studies of fisheries, the dynamics of currents, the profiles of ocean floors, and other oceanographic concerns. Later, Iselin was professor of oceanography at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1959–70) and Harvard University (1960–70).
