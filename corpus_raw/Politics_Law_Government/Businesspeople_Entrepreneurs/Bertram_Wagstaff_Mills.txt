Bertram Mills,  (born Aug. 11, 1873, London, Eng.—died  April 16, 1938, Chalfont St. Giles, Buckinghamshire), English circus entrepreneur who for 18 years (1920–37) staged a circus at London’s Olympia Theatre at Christmas and also toured through the British Isles.
A coachmaker’s son, Mills worked in his father’s business until World War I broke out, when he joined the Royal Army Medical Corps. After the war, a friend who directed the Olympia challenged him on his boast that he could produce a better show than the one he saw at the Olympia on Christmas Day 1919. He thereupon formed his own company from available performers, and his impromptu circus was an immediate success. In 1929 he inaugurated the Bertram Mills Tenting Circus, which toured the provinces from April to October and required up to four trains and 75 trucks and tractors to transport performers, animals, and equipment.
He was president of the Showman’s Guild from 1934 until his death. After his death, the circus was carried on by his sons, Cyril Bertram Mills and Bernard Notley Mills.
