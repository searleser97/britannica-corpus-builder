Gerard Barnes Lambert,  (born May 15, 1886, St. Louis, Mo., U.S.—died  Feb. 25, 1967, Princeton, N.J.), American merchandiser and advertiser who marketed his father’s invention of Listerine mouthwash by making bad breath a social disgrace.
After graduating from Princeton and studying architecture at Columbia University, Lambert fought in World War I and then joined his father’s firm, Lambert Pharmacal Co. The firm later became Warner-Lambert Pharmaceutical Co. As president of the firm in 1923, Lambert focussed on the advertising efforts for Listerine, an antiseptic that his father had invented. To carry out his advertising ideas, Lambert formed the advertising agency of Lambert & Feasley. With Lambert in charge, the pharmaceutical firm saw profits increase 60 times.
He sold his share of the business in 1928 and, after a three-year retirement, became president of the Gillette Safety Razor Co., which was in need of a reorganization. In three years he turned the company around by helping to develop the Gillette Blue Blade.
Relying on his architectural training, Lambert developed plans for the first low-cost subsidized housing for New Brunswick and Princeton, N.J., in 1938. Lambert was also a proficient yachtsman, an amateur archaeologist, an art collector, and a writer. His works include a mystery, Murder in Newport (1938), a yachting memoir, Yankee in England (1937), and his autobiography, All out of Step: A Personal Chronicle (1956).
