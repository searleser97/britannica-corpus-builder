He was famed for his editorials, which, in the words of a Pulitzer Prize citation (1953), revealed “an ability to discern the underlying moral issue, illuminated by a deep faith and confidence in the people of our country.” He won a second Pulitzer Prize (1984) for his weekly column in the Journal.
Royster was educated at the University of North Carolina, where he majored in English literature and graduated in 1935. In 1936 he joined the staff of the New York City News Bureau as a reporter and later that year moved to The Wall Street Journal and was assigned to its Washington (D.C.) bureau.
Royster enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1941, and as a line officer took part in actions in the Palau Islands, the Philippine Sea, and the Okinawa areas. He returned to the Journal after World War II. He became, successively, chief Washington correspondent, editorial writer and columnist, associate editor (1948–51), senior associate editor (1951–58), editor (1958–71), and senior vice president (1960–71) and then (from 1970) director of Dow Jones & Company, publishers of the Journal. In 1971 he was named editor emeritus, and he continued to write his weekly column until 1986.
Royster served as president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors. He also served as a professor at the University of North Carolina and as a member of the Pulitzer selection committee. His publications include the books Journey Through the Soviet Union (1962) and A Pride of Prejudices (1967).
