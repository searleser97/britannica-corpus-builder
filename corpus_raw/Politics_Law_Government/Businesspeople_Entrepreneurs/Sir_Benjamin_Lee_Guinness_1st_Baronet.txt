Sir Benjamin Lee Guinness, 1st Baronet,  (born November 1, 1798, Dublin, Ireland—died May 19, 1868, London, England), Irish brewer and first lord mayor of Dublin under the reformed corporation (1851), whose brewery became one of the largest in the world.
In 1855 Guinness assumed control of the brewing business, Arthur Guinness & Sons, started by his grandfather, Arthur Guinness (died 1803). He then developed a large export trade of stout to the United States, England, and continental Europe, which became the foundation of his fortune; he was said to be the richest man in Ireland. Guinness was succeeded in the business by his eldest son, Sir Arthur Edward (1840–1915), and later by his third son, Edward Cecil (1847–1927). Edward Cecil’s son Walter Edward (1880–1944) had a long political career.
Among Guinness’s many philanthropic activities was the restoration beginning in 1860 of St. Patrick’s Cathedral, Dublin, which was in a state of near ruin, and the adjacent Marsh Library. He represented Dublin in Parliament from 1865 until his death. He was created a baronet in 1867.
In 1997 the Guinness company merged with Grand Metropolitan PLC to form Diageo PLC, a company based in London. Arthur Guinness Son & Co., Ltd. was also known for The Guinness Book of World Records and other record books, originally published beginning in the 1950s to help solve trivia questions among patrons of Irish and English pubs; from 2008 the books were published by the Canadian-based Jim Pattison Group.
