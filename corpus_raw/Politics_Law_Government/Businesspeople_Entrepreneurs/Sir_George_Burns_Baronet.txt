Sir George Burns, Baronet,  (born December 10, 1795, Glasgow, Scotland—died June 2, 1890, Castle Wemyss, Renfrewshire [now in Fife]), Scottish shipping magnate and one of the founders of the Cunard Line.
Burns was the son of a Glasgow clergyman. In partnership with a brother, James, he began as a Glasgow general merchant, and in 1824, in conjunction with a Liverpool partner, Hugh Matthie, he started a line of small sailing ships that ran between Glasgow and Liverpool. Later, the vessels were also sailed to Belfast, and steamers replaced the sailing ships. In 1830 a partnership was entered into with the MacIvers of Liverpool. In 1839, with Samuel Cunard, Robert Napier, and other businessmen, the partners (David MacIver and Burns) started the British and North American Royal Mail Steam Packet company, later known as the Cunard Line. They secured the British government’s contract for the carrying of the mails of North America. Burns retired, extremely wealthy, in 1858 and was made a baronet in 1889.
His eldest son and heir, John Burns (1829–1901), became head of the Cunard company in 1880 and was created Baron Inverclyde in 1897.
