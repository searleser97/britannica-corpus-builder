Stavros Spyros Niarchos,  (born July 3, 1909, Athens, Greece—died  April 15, 1996, Zürich, Switz.), Greek shipping magnate and art collector.
In 1929 Niarchos graduated from the University of Athens in law and began working in his uncle’s flour mill. Recognizing the great transportation expense in importing Argentine wheat, Niarchos convinced his family that it would save money if it owned its own ships. Six freighters were bought for $120,000 during the Great Depression, and in 1939 Niarchos branched off to form his own firm, Niarchos Group, in which he owned two tankers and five other vessels.
While Niarchos served in the Greek navy during World War II, the Allied forces leased his ships, six of which were subsequently sunk in combat. Niarchos used the resulting $2,000,000 of insurance money as capital to expand his fleet and, in particular, to buy oil tankers. His philosophy was to buy and build big, and many of his supertankers set world records in size and carrying capacity. For many years he owned the largest private fleet in the world, some of his keenest competitors being his brother-in-law, Aristotle Onassis, and his father-in-law, Stavros Livanos. At its height his shipping company, Niarchos Ltd., operated more than 80 tankers, though Niarchos later sold off most of this fleet.
Niarchos also earned a reputation as an art investor and collector. In 1957 he purchased the French Impressionist art collection of the American actor Edward G. Robinson for more than $2,500,000. Although he owned homes in New York, London, Paris, and Athens, he spent much of his time on the Mediterranean Sea aboard his yacht Creole.
