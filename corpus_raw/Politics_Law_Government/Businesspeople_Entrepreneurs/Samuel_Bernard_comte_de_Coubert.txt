Samuel Bernard, count de Coubert,  (born Oct. 29, 1651, Sancerre, France—died  Jan. 18, 1739, Paris), French financier who became a symbol of Protestant banking. He had the same name as his father, a well-known painter.
Bernard started off in business selling gold brocade and jewelry, but he soon went into banking, assisted by refugee Protestants in other countries. He had renounced Protestantism in 1676, but it was a device that fooled no one.
By 1695 Bernard was considered the greatest banker in Europe. Louis XIV, although never comfortable with Bernard’s religious affiliations, overlooked them in order to have Bernard mobilize the capital of Europe to finance the French military campaigns. Bernard, at Louis XIV’s request, lent France 11,000,000 francs in 1697 and another 19,000,000 in 1708. For these services, Louis gave him a title of nobility with the unusual stipulation that Bernard remain in commerce so the state could always depend on him. Notorious for his flattery to the king, Bernard was made count de Coubert (1725) and counselor of state (1730). Bernard’s wealth was made through war profiteering and speculation, and many felt that he aggrandized his own fortune at the expense of the country. He died leaving an estate of 33,000,000 francs.
