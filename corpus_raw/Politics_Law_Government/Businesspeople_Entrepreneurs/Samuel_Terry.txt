Samuel Terry,  (born 1776?, England—died Feb. 22, 1838, New South Wales, Austl.), pioneer Australian landowner and merchant, known as the “Botany Bay Rothschild.”
Terry was transported to the British colony of New South Wales after having been convicted of stealing 400 pairs of stockings. Even before his sentence expired in 1807, he had opened a shop in Parramutta; and in 1810 he moved to Sydney, opening an inn and a store and marrying a widow. Within 10 years he became amazingly prosperous, speculating in urban and rural properties, acquiring mortgages, and becoming one of the largest shareholders in the Bank of New South Wales. In the 1820s and ’30s he also became a philanthropist and a sometime politician, espousing the causes of the emancipists. He was the first of a politically and financially influential Australian family, which intermarried with other successful families.
