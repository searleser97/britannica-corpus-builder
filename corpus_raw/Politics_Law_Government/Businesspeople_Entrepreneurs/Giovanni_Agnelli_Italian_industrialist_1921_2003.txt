Giovanni Agnelli,  (born March 12, 1921, Turin, Italy—died January 24, 2003, Turin), chairman of the automobile manufacturing company Fiat SpA, Italy’s largest private business enterprise, from 1966 to 2003.
Grandson of Fiat’s founder (also named Giovanni Agnelli), the younger Giovanni was brought up in affluence and groomed by his grandfather to run the family business. His father had died when the boy was 14 years old, making Giovanni—the oldest son—next in line to take over control of Fiat from his grandfather.
Agnelli resisted his grandfather’s plea to take a safe job with Fiat during World War II, insisting instead on seeing combat with the Italian army—first against the Russians and later against the Germans. After the war, Agnelli accepted his grandfather’s advice to enjoy life to the fullest before settling down, and for several years Giovanni Agnelli was one of the world’s leading playboys. A serious car crash in 1952, however, put an end to his days of racing automobiles.
By that time Agnelli was already head of the family’s ball-bearing enterprise and vice-chairman of Fiat’s board of directors. In 1963 he took over as Fiat’s managing director and in 1966 succeeded to operational control of the company as chairman and chief executive officer. As such, he became one of the most powerful men in western Europe, and he was credited with helping industrialize postwar Italy. In addition to making automobiles, Agnelli’s industrial colossus had interests in insurance, shipping, oil refining, publishing, banking, retailing, athletic teams, hotels, food and drink purveyors, and factories that produce cement, chemicals, and plastics. By the late 1990s, however, Fiat was experiencing financial difficulties, and the company was in the midst of restructuring at the time of Agnelli’s death.
