Henry Baldwin Hyde,  (born Feb. 15, 1834, Catskill, N.Y., U.S.—died  May 2, 1899, New York City), American capitalist who was the founder of the Equitable Life Assurance Society.
In 1852 Hyde became a clerk at the Mutual Life Insurance Co. and, in the next seven years, learned the business, advancing to the post of cashier. In 1859 Hyde left Mutual Life, announcing his intention to start his own insurance company. In that year, he raised $100,000 as starting capital and rented an office on a floor above his former employer, putting up a sign that dwarfed Mutual Life’s. He spent the next 40 years running his Equitable Life Assurance Society, holding the title of vice president until 1874 and president from 1874 until his death.
In the first year, he wrote policies worth more than $1,000,000, and no death claims were presented. The year before Hyde’s death, the company’s insurance in force was worth more than $1,000,000,000. During his entire 40 years with the society, it paid out $307,000,000 in benefits.
Hyde determined all the company’s policies and communicated with his field agents in a company newsletter, written largely by him. Instead of paying yearly dividends to his policyholders, Hyde in 1868 developed the Tontine plan, whereby benefits are disbursed when the policy reaches a certain age. The popularity of this plan increased the company’s surplus from $7,000,000 in 1868 to $26,000,000 by 1874. Hyde himself prospered under this plan by allowing himself 2.5 percent of the surplus annually until 1875.
In 1877 New York state began investigating the mismanagement of surplus funds by insurance companies. These investigations were to lead to the passage, in 1906, of the Armstrong Bills reorganizing the insurance business and regulating its management of surplus funds.
