J. Arthur Rank, Baron Rank,  (born December 22 or 23, 1888, Hull, Yorkshire, England—died March 29, 1972, Winchester, Hampshire), British industrialist who became Great Britain’s chief distributor (and one of the world’s major producers) of motion pictures.
The youngest son of Joseph Rank, a flour miller and Methodist philanthropist, he served (1952–69) as chairman of his family business, Ranks Hovis McDougall, Ltd. Earlier, in the 1930s, he turned to making religious films as instructional aids for Methodist Sunday school classes. In 1935 his British National Film Company made its first commercial picture, The Turn of the Tide, about a Yorkshire fishing village. In the same year he and Charles M. Woolf established General Film Distributors, Ltd., which handled the distribution of Universal Pictures films in Britain. The company grew rapidly, and by 1941 Rank controlled two of the three largest movie theatre chains in Great Britain. In 1946 the J. Arthur Rank Organisation was incorporated, and this company dominated British film production during that industry’s most productive period, the late 1940s and the ’50s. Rank was chairman (1946–62) and president (1962–72) of the Rank Organisation, but his company withdrew from motion-picture activities in favour of hotel ownership and other more profitable enterprises in the late 1960s. He was raised to the peerage in 1957 (the barony becoming extinct upon his death). Mr. Rank, a biography by Alan Wood, appeared in 1952.
