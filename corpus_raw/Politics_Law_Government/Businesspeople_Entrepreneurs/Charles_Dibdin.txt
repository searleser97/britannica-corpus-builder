Charles Dibdin,  (baptized March 15, 1745, Southampton, Hampshire, England—died July 25, 1814, London), composer, author, actor, and theatrical manager whose sea songs and operas made him one of the most popular English composers of the late 18th century.
A chorister at Winchester Cathedral, Dibdin went to London at age 15, worked for a music publisher, and began his stage career at Richmond in 1762. He later acted in London, notably as Ralph in Samuel Arnold’s The Maid of the Mill. His first operetta, The Shepherd’s Artifice, was produced at Covent Garden in 1764. By 1778, when he became composer to Covent Garden, he had produced eight operas, among them The Padlock (1768), The Waterman (1774), and The Quaker (1775). He managed the Royal Circus, later the Surrey Theatre, during 1782–84 and in 1785 produced his ballad opera Liberty Hall. After the failure of a projected trip to India, he began about 1789 to produce his celebrated one-man “table entertainments,” in which he acted as author, singer, and accompanist. Most of his sea songs were written for these entertainments, among them “Tom Bowling” (written in memory of his brother, a ship’s captain), “To Bachelors’ Hall,” “Poor Jack,” and “ ’Twas in the Good Ship Rover.”
A self-taught musician, Dibdin wrote about 100 stage works, about 1,400 songs, often to his own words, and some instrumental works. He also wrote several novels. Restless, irascible, flagrantly racist, and frequently in debt (for which he fled to France on one occasion and later spent time in debtor’s prison), he was a born melodist who excelled in writing for the voice.
