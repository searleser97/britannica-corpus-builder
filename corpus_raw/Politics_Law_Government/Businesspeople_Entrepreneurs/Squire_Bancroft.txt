Sir Squire Bancroft,  (born May 14, 1841, London, England—died April 19, 1926, London), English actor and manager whose espousal of careful craft in the writing and staging of plays did much to lay the foundations of modern theatrical production.
Left fatherless at an early age, Bancroft was educated privately in England and France. He first appeared on the stage in Birmingham in 1861 and played in the provinces before his London appearance in 1865. He married the theatre manager Marie Effie Wilton in 1867. At the Prince of Wales’s Theatre, they produced all the better-known comedies of Thomas William Robertson, among them Society (1865) and Caste (1867). These productions swept away the old crude methods of writing and staging. Later they produced new plays and revivals, such as Bulwer-Lytton’s Money, Dion Boucicault’s London Assurance, and an adaptation of Sardou’s Dora entitled Diplomacy. In 1880 they moved to the Haymarket Theatre and continued a brilliant career until their retirement from management in 1885. Bancroft played with Henry Irving in 1889 and was knighted in 1897. Together the Bancrofts wrote Mr. and Mrs. Bancroft on and off the Stage (1888) and The Bancrofts: Recollections of Sixty Years (1909). Sir Squire’s Empty Chairs (1925) is a volume of his reminiscences.
