James Blair,  (born May 1656, Banffshire, Scotland—died April 18, 1743, Williamsburg, Va. [U.S.]), clergyman and founder (1693) of the College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, Va., the second oldest institution of higher learning in the United States.
Blair was ordained in the Church of England (1679) but was deprived of his parish in Edinburgh in 1681 for refusing to take an oath supporting the legitimate claim of the Roman Catholic duke of York (afterward James II) as heir to the throne. In 1685 he left for North America, where he was elected rector of Varina parish, Henrico county, Va.
Appointed bishop’s representative in Virginia in 1689, Blair proposed (1691) the founding of a college. With the endorsement of the Virginia General Assembly he returned to England to secure from the English sovereigns William III and Mary II a charter and a grant of funds for the college, which was named for its royal patrons. The charter was granted on Feb. 8, 1693. As the first president of the college, Blair proved to be a canny and expert fund-raiser, extracting money from people of all ranks and persuasions and, especially, from the estate of the natural philosopher Robert Boyle. He served for 50 years, one of the longest tenures of any university president.
