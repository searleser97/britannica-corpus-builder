William E. Dodge, in full William Earl Dodge,  (born Sept. 4, 1805, Hartford, Conn., U.S.—died  Feb. 9, 1883, New York, N.Y.), American merchant, cofounder of Phelps, Dodge & Company, which was one of the largest mining companies in the United States for more than a century.
Descended from early New England settlers, Dodge began his career in the dry-goods business. In 1833 he and his father-in-law, Anson Phelps, organized the firm of Phelps, Dodge & Company, a dealer in metals. The company soon established a prosperous trade throughout the United States and abroad, eventually becoming the largest American importer of metals. Dodge’s extensive investments included timberland in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and elsewhere; a copper mine in Minnesota; an iron mine in New Jersey; and mills in Connecticut, New Jersey, and other states. Dodge also had interests in a number of railroads, several of which served his metals companies.
In 1882 the company purchased the Copper Queen mine in Arizona, which signaled its entry into the front ranks of American mining companies, although metals extraction did not become the firm’s primary business until after Dodge’s death.
Considered an energetic and conservative man, Dodge was noted for his civic activities and his efforts on behalf of religious and temperance societies. He also served one term as a member of the U.S. Congress (1866–67), where he was an outspoken advocate of moderate postwar Reconstruction policies.
