Daniel Coit Gilman,  (born July 6, 1831, Norwich, Conn., U.S.—died  Oct. 13, 1908, Norwich), American educator and first president of Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore.
After graduating from Yale University in 1852, Gilman traveled to St. Petersburg, Russia, with his friend A.D. White (who became the first president of Cornell University in 1868). Gilman worked as an attaché in St. Petersburg and then studied in Berlin (1854–55). For 17 years thereafter, he worked at Yale—as assistant librarian, professor of geography, and secretary of the governing board of Yale’s Sheffield Scientific School. From 1872 to 1875 he headed the University of California at Berkeley. In 1875 Gilman became the first president of Johns Hopkins, remaining there until 1901, after which he served as the first president of the Carnegie Institution at Washington, D.C., until 1904.
Gilman’s influence on higher education in the United States was considerable. He made Johns Hopkins an exemplar of the modern university, ridding it of denominational control, absorption in undergraduate teaching, and exclusive attention to the humanities. He brought the university under the control of a lay board, introduced the sciences into the curriculum, promoted advanced research, and created professional schools. Gilman helped reorganize the Johns Hopkins Hospital, of which he was made director in 1889. He was also president of the National Civil Service Reform League.
