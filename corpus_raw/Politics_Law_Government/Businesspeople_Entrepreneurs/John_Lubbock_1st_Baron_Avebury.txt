John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury,  (born April 30, 1834, London—died  May 28, 1913, Kingsgate Castle, Kent, Eng.), banker, influential Liberal-Unionist politician, and naturalist who successfully promoted about a dozen measures of some importance in Parliament but was perhaps best known for his books on archaeology and entomology.
He became a partner in his father’s bank at 22, succeeded him to the baronetcy in 1865, and served on commissions relating to coinage and other financial questions. In Pre-historic Times (1865), long used as a textbook of archaeology, and in The Origin of Civilization and the Primitive Condition of Man, he coined the terms Paleolithic (Old Stone Age) and Neolithic (New Stone Age).
Lubbock was elected to Parliament for Maidstone, Kent (1870 and 1874), and served as vice chancellor of the University of London (1872–80). During that period he secured passage of the Bank Holidays Act (1871) and wrote The Origin and Metamorphoses of Insects (1873) and British Wild Flowers (1875). Elected to Parliament for the University of London (1880–1900), he influenced passage of the Bills of Exchange and Ancient Monuments Protection acts (1882) and the Shop Hours Act (1889). He also wrote Ants, Bees, and Wasps (1882) and On the Senses, Instincts, and Intelligence of Animals (1888), which established him as a pioneer in the field of animal behaviour.
