Stephen D. Bechtel, in full Stephen Davison Bechtel,  (born September 24, 1900, Aurora, Indiana, U.S.—died March 14, 1989, San Francisco, California), American construction engineer and business executive, president (1936–60) of W.A. Bechtel Company and its successor, Bechtel Corp., one of the world’s largest construction and engineering firms. Projects to which his firm and its affiliated companies have substantially contributed include the Hoover Dam, the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, the Alaska oil pipeline, and rapid transit systems in San Francisco and Washington, D.C.
When his father organized the W.A. Bechtel Company in San Francisco in 1925, Bechtel became, at age 25, a vice president of one of the largest construction companies in the western United States. He became president in 1936. A year later he and John McCone formed the Bechtel–McCone Corporation, which built refineries and chemical plants. Bechtel’s companies built ships and aircraft parts during World War II. After the war, the newly formed Bechtel Corporation built pipelines in Canada, the Middle East, and elsewhere and constructed power plants all over the world. In 1977 it was estimated that the various Bechtel companies had designed or built half the nuclear power plants then operating in the United States. Considered an energetic and imaginative manager, Bechtel was frequently called on to handle unusually large or complex projects.
He retired as president of the company in 1960; however, he remained a senior director of what became known as the Bechtel Group, which in the 1970s and ’80s was at work on the construction of an enormous city, Al-Jubayl, for the Saudi Arabian government.
