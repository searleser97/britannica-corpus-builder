W.C. Coup, in full William Cameron Coup,  (born 1837, Mount Pleasant, Indiana, U.S.—died 1895, Jacksonville, Florida), American businessman, cofounder and manager of P.T. Barnum’s “Greatest Show on Earth.”
Working his way from circus roustabout to manager, Coup, in 1872, persuaded P.T. Barnum to end his retirement and join him in starting the circus that later became “The Greatest Show on Earth.” Barnum furnished his name and capital, and Coup provided executive talent. In his first season with Barnum, Coup developed a new system of loading circus wagons onto railroad flatcars. The cars were joined by metal plates, and the circus wagons boarded from the end of the train and were moved forward toward the front rather than onto each car separately. He also arranged cut-rate railroad excursions on circus days. After he left Barnum in 1875, Coup ran an aquarium in New York City, took a circus on the road, and finally retired to a farm near Delavan, Wisconsin.
