John Rolfe,  (baptized May 6, 1585, Norfolk, England—died 1622?, Virginia [U.S.]), Virginia planter and colonial official who was the husband of Pocahontas, daughter of the Indian chief Powhatan.
John Rolfe sailed for Virginia in 1609, but a shipwreck in the Bermudas delayed his arrival until the following year. About 1612 he began to experiment with growing tobacco. When he found that the local variety was too bitter for English tastes, he began cultivating seeds that he brought from the West Indies. In June 1613 Rolfe sent some of the West Indian tobacco to England. Its widespread acceptance there provided needed economic stability for Virginia.
The Indian princess Pocahontas, who was then held captive in Jamestown, was baptized, and Rolfe, a widower, obtained permission to marry her from her father, Powhatan, and the Virginia governor, Sir Thomas Dale. Rolfe and the princess were married on April 5, 1614, an event that assured peace with the local Indians for eight years. The couple had one son, Thomas (b. 1615). In 1616 the Virginia Company sponsored a trip to England for the couple and their infant son. The family was enthusiastically received in England, but Pocahontas (then renamed Rebecca) became ill and died in March 1617 as they were preparing to return to Virginia. (Their son was raised by an uncle and did not return to America until 1640.)
Rolfe returned to Virginia and married again (to one Jane Pierce), and in 1621 he was appointed to the colony’s Council of State. (He previously had served as secretary and recorder of the colony.) In 1622, during a massacre, his large farm at Bermuda Hundred was destroyed and Rolfe apparently perished.
