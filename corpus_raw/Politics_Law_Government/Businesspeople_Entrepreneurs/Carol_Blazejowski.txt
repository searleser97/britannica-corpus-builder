Carol Blazejowski,  (born Sept. 29, 1956, Elizabeth, N.J., U.S.), American basketball player and sports executive whose playing career featured a number of records and firsts.
Blazejowski grew up in Cranford, N.J., and began playing basketball on a school team in her senior year of high school in 1974. The following year she joined the team at Montclair (N.J.) State College. A highly competitive player, Blazejowski (known as “Blaze”) set long-standing records for the highest women’s career scoring average (31.7 points per game [ppg]) and single-season average (38.6 ppg). She was a three-time All-American (1976, 1977, and 1978), and in 1978 she was awarded the first Wade Trophy for Women’s Basketball Player of the Year. On March 6, 1977, Blazejowski scored a record 52 points against Queens College before a crowd of 12,000 at Madison Square Garden in New York City.
In 1979 Blazejowski was on the first U.S. women’s basketball team to win a gold medal at the World University Games (WUG) in Mexico City. Two years earlier she had played at the WUG in Sofia, Bulg., when the U.S. team won a silver medal. Both years Blazejowski was the team’s top scorer, with 129 points total (18.4 ppg) in 1979 and 164 points total (20.5 ppg) in 1977. At the 1979 Pan American Games, she was part of the U.S. women’s basketball team that won the silver medal.
Although she had been selected for the 1980 Olympic team, Blazejowski was deprived of the opportunity to compete when the U.S. government called a boycott of the Moscow Games. In 1980–81 she played for the New Jersey Gems in the Women’s Basketball League (WBL) until the WBL went bankrupt. During that season she led the league in scoring and was named Most Valuable Player. Throughout the 1980s Blazejowski worked in promotions and marketing for sporting-goods firms such as Adidas. In 1990 she took a position with the National Basketball Association (NBA) in the Consumer Products Group. While working for the NBA, she became involved in the development of the Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA). Before the WNBA’s debut in the summer of 1997, she signed on as vice president and general manager of the New York Liberty professional team. She was promoted to president of the team in 2008 but left the Liberty in 2010. In 1994 Blazejowski became one of the few women inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.
