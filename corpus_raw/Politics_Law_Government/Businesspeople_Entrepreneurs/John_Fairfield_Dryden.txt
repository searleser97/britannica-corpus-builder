John Fairfield Dryden,  (born Aug. 7, 1839, Temple Mills, Maine, U.S.—died  Nov. 24, 1911), American senator and businessman, the founder of the Prudential Insurance Company of America, the first company to issue industrial life insurance in the United States.
Dryden made a study, while attending Yale College (1861–65), of industrial, or “workingman’s,” insurance (small policies usually based on weekly premiums) as developed by the Prudential Assurance Company of London and by private benevolent societies. In 1873 Dryden and a few backers founded the Widows and Orphans Friendly Society in Newark, N.J. It was succeeded in 1875 by the Prudential Friendly Society, which took the name Prudential Insurance Company of America in 1877. Dryden was secretary of the company from 1875 to 1881 and president from 1881 until his death. He was U.S. senator from New Jersey in 1902–07. His son Forrest Fairfield Dryden (1864–1932) succeeded him as Prudential’s president in 1912.
