Joseph Mercer,  (born Aug. 9, 1914, Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, Eng.—died Aug. 9, 1990, Manchester), distinguished British football (soccer) player (1931–54) and manager.
Mercer overcame spindly legs and bad knees to become an outstanding left-half with Everton (1931–46), the champions of England’s Football League in 1939. That year he was selected to play for England, and, while in the army, he continued to represent his country in wartime international competition. After World War II he returned to Everton, but his persistent knee problems prompted the team to sell his contract to Arsenal. He altered his aggressive style to play defensive wing-half and led his new team to win the league championship twice (1948 and 1953) and the Football Association (FA) Cup in 1950 (they were runners-up in 1952). He retired after breaking a leg in a game against Liverpool FC.
Mercer managed Sheffield United and Aston Villa before becoming manager of Manchester City (1965–72), where his teams won the League Championship (1968), FA Cup (1969), League Cup (1970), and European Cup-Winners’ Cup (1970). Later he was general manager of Coventry, and in 1974 he served briefly as England’s caretaker manager. He was chosen Footballer of the Year in 1950 and was made an Officer of the British Empire in 1976.
