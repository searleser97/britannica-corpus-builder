Walter Hampden, original name Walter Hampden Dougherty,  (born June 30, 1879, Brooklyn, New York, U.S.—died June 11, 1955, Los Angeles, California), American actor, theatre manager, and repertory producer.
Hampden attended Harvard briefly but graduated from Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute. After a year’s study of singing, dancing, speech, and playing the cello in France, Hampden joined Sir Frank Benson’s company in England, where he played more than 70 classical roles in three years. In 1905 he married Mabel Moore, an actress in the troupe, and in 1906 he played Hamlet in London to great applause. After his return to the United States in 1907, he appeared in several modern dramas with Nazimova, but his Hamlet was so successful that when he formed his own repertory company that play became its foundation. In 1923 Hampden revived Edmond Rostand’s Cyrano de Bergerac, a play still associated with his name. He opened his own theatre (1925) with Ethel Barrymore as his leading lady, and in the ensuing years he gave outstanding performances in Hamlet, The Merchant of Venice (1925–26), and An Enemy of the People (1927–28). Hampden appeared in his first motion picture, The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1929), and later played the part of an aging actor in All About Eve (1950). He made his television debut as Macbeth in 1949. Hampden was the fourth president of the Players’ Club.
