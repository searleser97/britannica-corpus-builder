Edward Knight Collins,  (born Aug. 5, 1802, Truro, Mass., U.S.—died Jan. 22, 1878, New York City), shipowner who in 1847 founded the government-subsidized United States Mail Steamship Company (Collins Line), which for a time gave serious competition to the British Cunard Line. From 1850 to 1854 Collins’s paddle-wheel steamers, the “Atlantic,” “Pacific,” “Arctic,” and “Baltic,” were the fastest and most luxurious ships in the transatlantic service. In 1858, after the loss of two ships at sea and the withdrawal of the government subsidy, the line ceased operations.
