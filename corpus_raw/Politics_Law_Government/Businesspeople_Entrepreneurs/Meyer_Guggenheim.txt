Meyer Guggenheim,  (born Feb. 1, 1828, Langnau, Switz.—died March 15, 1905, Palm Beach, Fla., U.S.), American industrialist and philanthropist who developed worldwide mining interests that, when merged with the American Smelting and Refining Company in 1901, dominated the industry for the next three decades and laid the foundation for the present U.S. mining industry.
After emigrating to the United States from Switzerland in 1847, Meyer Guggenheim built an import firm in Philadelphia, which specialized in Swiss embroideries. In the early 1880s he acquired interests in two Colorado copper mines. Realizing their potential value, he eventually invested his entire fortune in the mines; his seven sons, especially Daniel Guggenheim, supervised the acquisition and operation of smelters. In 1891 the Guggenheims formed a trust, consolidating about a dozen of their refining operations under the name Colorado Smelting and Refining Company. In 1901 they assumed leadership of the U.S. mining industry by gaining control of the American Smelting and Refining Company, a trust composed of the country’s largest metal-processing plants. Under Daniel’s leadership, the trust acquired mines in lands far afield, including Alaska, Bolivia, Chile, and the Congo.
In 1925 the sixth son of Meyer Guggenheim, Simon Guggenheim (1867–1941), established in memory of his son the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation to award fellowships to aid artists and scholars studying abroad.
Solomon Guggenheim (1861–1949), the fourth son of Meyer Guggenheim, founded in 1937 the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation for the advancement of art, which operates the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and Guggenheim Museum SoHo in New York City, the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice, and the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in Bilbao, Spain, among others.
