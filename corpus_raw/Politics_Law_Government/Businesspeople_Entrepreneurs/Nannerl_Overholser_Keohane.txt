Nannerl Overholser Keohane, née Nannerl Overholser,  (born Sept. 18, 1940, Blytheville, Ark., U.S.), American academician and administrator who gained particular prominence when she became the first woman president of Duke University in Durham, N.C.
Keohane received an undergraduate degree from Wellesley (Massachusetts) College in 1961. She studied for the next two years in England at the University of Oxford, where she earned a second bachelor’s degree. After completing a doctorate in political science at Yale University in New Haven, Conn., in 1967, she taught at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania (1967–73) and Stanford University in California (1973–81). In 1981 she was appointed president of Wellesley College, where she held a concurrent appointment as professor of political science.
In 1993 Keohane left Wellesley to become president of and professor of political science at Duke University. Her presidency of a major women’s college followed by a similar appointment at a major research university led to her induction in 1995 into the National Women’s Hall of Fame, which also cited her efforts to increase minority student enrollment and improve faculty diversity. After retiring as president of Duke in 2004, Keohane was appointed Laurance S. Rockefeller Distinguished Visiting Professor of Public Affairs and the University Center for Human Values at Princeton University in 2005. From 2004 to 2005 she was a fellow at Stanford’s Center for Advanced Behavior Studies.
She is the author of Philosophy and the State in France: The Renaissance to the Enlightenment (1980) and coeditor of Feminist Theory: A Critique of Ideology (1982). A book of Keohane’s selected speeches, A Community Worthy of the Name, was published in 1995, followed by Higher Ground: Ethics and Leadership in the Modern University (2006), a collection of essays and speeches addressing the challenges facing universities.
