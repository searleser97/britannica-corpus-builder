Charles Crocker,  (born Sept. 16, 1822, Troy, N.Y., U.S.—died  Aug. 14, 1888, Monterey, Calif.), American businessman and banker, chief contractor in the building of the Central Pacific (later the Southern Pacific) Railroad.
Crocker was forced to quit school at an early age to help support his family. After his family moved to Indiana, he did various jobs—farming, working in a sawmill, and serving as an apprentice in a blacksmith shop and foundry. Finally, he and his brothers Clark and Henry migrated overland to California (1850) after gold was discovered there. Crocker abandoned his attempt at prospecting in 1852 and opened a store in Sacramento, becoming extremely wealthy by 1854. In 1855 he was elected to the city council and, in 1860, to the state legislature, as a Republican.
In 1861 Crocker joined fellow merchants Collis P. Huntington, Leland Stanford, and Mark Hopkins (known collectively as the “Big Four”) in a new railway company, the Central Pacific, which was appointed to build the western portion of the first American transcontinental railroad. Crocker became the contractor in charge of construction, hiring men and equipment, setting up campsites, and acting as paymaster and accountant. He was responsible for importing Chinese labourers (the “coolie system”). The line that he started building on Feb. 22, 1863, met the Union Pacific line, running from the east, at Promontory Point, Utah, on May 10, 1869.
In 1871 he became president of the Southern Pacific Railroad of California and, in 1884, oversaw the new incorporation of Southern Pacific, which absorbed the Central Pacific. Crocker also engaged in real estate, industrial properties, and banking (his Crocker First National Bank of San Francisco, chartered in 1870, was an ancestor of the modern Crocker National Bank, which merged with Wells Fargo & Company in 1986). He built a showplace mansion in San Francisco (which burned down in 1906) and a second home in New York City. His fortune at his death was estimated at $40 million.
