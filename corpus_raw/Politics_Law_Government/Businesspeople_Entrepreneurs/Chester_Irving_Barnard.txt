Chester Irving Barnard,  (born Nov. 7, 1886, Malden, Mass., U.S.—died June 7, 1961, New York City), American business executive, public administrator, and sociological theorist who studied the nature of corporate organization. Although he was not himself an academic, his first book, Functions of the Executive (1938), became an essential resource in the teaching of organizational sociology and business theory.
An employee of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (now AT&T) from 1909, Barnard became president of an AT&T subsidiary, the New Jersey Bell Telephone Company, in 1927. During the Great Depression, he directed the New Jersey state relief system. He later worked with the United Service Organizations (USO), of which he was president from 1942 to 1945. When he retired from business, he served as president of the Rockefeller Foundation (1948–52) and chairman of the National Science Foundation (1952–54).
