Wilhelmina Cooper, original name in full Gertrude Wilhelmina Behmenburg,  (born May 1, 1939, Culemborg, Netherlands—died March 1, 1980, Greenwich, Connecticut, U.S.), Dutch-born fashion model and businesswoman who, with her husband, founded the modeling agency Wilhelmina Models Inc.
In many eyes, Cooper epitomized the high society look of the 1950s and ’60s with her 5-foot 11-inch (1.8-metre) curvaceous figure, large brown eyes, high cheekbones, and often upswept brown hair. She appeared on nearly 300 covers of major American and European magazines; she was featured on the cover of Vogue a record 28 times. In 1967, at the height of her career as one of the country’s most-photographed models, she opened her own modeling agency. Cooper’s business success was showcased when her photo appeared on the cover of Fortune magazine’s December 1979 issue; she had become one of the few women ever to appear on the cover alone. At the time of Cooper’s death, Wilhelmina Models Inc. reportedly rivaled Eileen Ford’s modeling agency in size and billings.
