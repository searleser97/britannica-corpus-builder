Peter Voser, in full Peter Robert Voser,  (born August 29, 1958, Baden, Switzerland), Swiss businessman who was chief executive officer (CEO) of Royal Dutch Shell PLC (2009–13).
Voser studied business administration at the University of Applied Sciences, Zürich, and took a job with Shell in 1982. He rose through the ranks with posts in Europe and South America, and in 2001 he was named chief financial officer (CFO) of Shell’s Global Oil Products Business. When a rival executive was appointed Shell’s CFO in 2002, Voser resigned to join Switzerland’s Asea Brown Boveri (ABB) Group, but two years later his rival was out, and Voser was back at Shell as CFO. He soon issued a companywide memo in which he claimed that Shell’s costs were too high, its leadership structure too complex, and its culture “too consensus-oriented.”
By the time Voser became CEO in 2009, Shell had endured six years of declining output. He attempted a financial balancing act: cutting costs while stepping up investment levels for new production ventures. To this end, he launched a reorganization meant to break up Shell’s corporate “fiefdoms,” merging various units and cutting some 5,000 jobs. He also led Shell to sell off many of its noncentral businesses and place new bets across the globe, including partnerships with Russia’s OAO Gazprom and China’s CNPC and big-ticket investments in Canada. Under Voser’s direction, Shell also began investing in various exploration and production projects at a time when declining oil and gas prices were reducing profits throughout the energy sector. Voser justified his strategy by estimating that energy demand would double over the next 40 years. In 2013 he stepped down as chairman.
Two years later Voser returned to ABB as chairman of its board of directors, and in 2019–20 he also served as CEO.
