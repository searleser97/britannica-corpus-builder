James William Wallack,  (born August 24, 1795, London, England—died December 25, 1864, New York, New York, U.S.), leading British-American actor and manager of New York theatres, from whose acting company (continued by his son, Lester Wallack) developed many of the important American stage performers of the 19th century.
Wallack was born to a London stage family and at age four first performed with other members of his family at the Royal Circus. In 1807, when he was 12, he began appearing in plays by William Shakespeare and Richard Brinsley Sheridan at Drury Lane. Between 1818, when he made his American debut as Macbeth, and 1852 he reputedly crossed the Atlantic 35 times for various engagements in London and New York.
In 1837 with his brother, Henry John Wallack, he took over the National Theatre in New York, he as general manager and his brother as stage manager and a leading player. The theatre burned two years later, and James subsequently toured in America and the British Isles for several years. In 1852 he took over the Lyceum Theatre in New York City. He renamed it Wallack’s Lyceum and, with his son Lester as stage manager and his son Charles as treasurer, for nine successful years managed the company in a repertory of Shakespeare, standard comedies, and some contemporary drama. He continued acting until 1859, when he returned entirely to management. In 1861 he moved the troupe to a new playhouse at Broadway and 13th Street called Wallack’s Theatre.
