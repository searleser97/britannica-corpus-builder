Emma A. Summers,  (born 1858—died November 27, 1941, Glendale, California, U.S.), American businesswoman who became known as the Oil Queen of California for her role in the Los Angeles oil boom at the turn of the 20th century.
Summers graduated from the New England Conservatory of Music and became a piano teacher. She moved west to Texas and then to Los Angeles, where she saved the money that she earned from piano lessons and began to invest in real estate. The oil boom in Los Angeles began when Edward L. Doheny and Charles A. Canfield struck oil in Crown Hill in November 1892. Summers took $700 from her savings and bought a half interest in a well, and she borrowed money so that she could invest in several more wells in Crown Hill.
By the early 1900s Summers owned more than a dozen wells, producing about 50,000 barrels a month. When oil prices collapsed in 1903, she began to buy out other operators, and she patiently waited for the oil prices to rise again. By World War I, Summers’s wait was over. Oil was needed for the war effort, and people in the Los Angeles area began to own and operate their own cars, which created a greater need in the local market.
As Summers’s fortune grew, she expanded her real-estate holdings and amassed a sizable personal art collection. As wells went dry in the 1920s, however, the Los Angeles oil market diminished in importance as larger fields were uncovered elsewhere in southern California. Summers was beset with financial difficulties, and she was forced to sell personal assets to satisfy her debts. At the time of her death, her fortune was greatly diminished, but her place in local lore remained secure.
