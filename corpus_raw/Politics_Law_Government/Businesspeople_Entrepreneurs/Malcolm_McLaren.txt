Malcolm McLaren, in full Malcolm Robert Andrew McLaren,  (born January 22, 1946, London, England—died April 8, 2010, Switzerland), British rock impresario and musician who, as the colourfully provocative manager of the punk band the Sex Pistols, helped birth punk culture.
McLaren attended a number of art schools in England, where he was drawn to the subversive Marxist-rooted philosophy of the Situationist International movement and its leading figure, Guy Debord. With his girlfriend, fashion designer Vivienne Westwood, he opened the avant-garde clothing boutique Let It Rock, in 1971, but he soon became more interested in rock music as a means to enact his radical aesthetic ideas.
After a brief stint managing and costuming the American glam rock band the New York Dolls, in 1975 he began to work with a band that—in a cross-marketing ploy with the clothes shop, which had been rebranded as Sex—he named the Sex Pistols. By the following year the raucous punk group had become a cause célèbre in the United Kingdom, and McLaren eagerly fueled the controversy with stunts such as having the band play its anti-authoritarian anthem “God Save the Queen” aboard a boat outside the Houses of Parliament in London.
Following the Sex Pistols’ collapse in 1978, McLaren guided the image and career of new-wave band Adam and the Ants and formed a spin-off act, Bow Wow Wow. In 1983 he released his own solo album,  Duck Rock, an eclectic fusion of hip-hop and world music that spawned two British top 10 hits: “Buffalo Gals” and “Double Dutch.” Several other albums followed, including the opera-inspired Fans (1984), Waltz Darling (1989), and Paris (1994).
