Walter A. Haas,  (born May 11, 1889, San Francisco, Calif., U.S.—died  Dec. 7, 1979, San Francisco), American business executive credited with saving the foundering Levi Strauss & Co., the major manufacturer of “blue jean” denim pants. Haas’s efforts after World War II laid the groundwork for the company’s dramatic growth during the blue-jean boom of the 1960s and ’70s.
Haas’s association with Levi Strauss & Co. began in 1914 with his marriage to Elise Stern, whose father Jacob was one of four nephews who had inherited the company from their uncle Levi Strauss, the founder. The company was doing poorly, and the nephews were considering liquidation, but Haas urged otherwise and within two years after joining the firm in 1919 had managed to reverse its fortunes. In 1928 he became president, a post he was to retain until 1955.
Haas’s most significant move came in 1946, when he decided to get Levi Strauss out of the wholesale dry-goods business, which then accounted for 75 percent of the company’s $8 million annual sales, and concentrate instead on manufacturing. Haas also expanded the company’s distribution, diversified its product line, and aimed more products at young people. By the time of his death sales exceeded $2 billion annually. Haas’s family continued to control Levi Strauss, with his sons Walter A., Jr., and Peter serving as chairman and president, respectively.
