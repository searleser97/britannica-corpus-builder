Lothar von Faber,  (born June 12, 1817, Stein, Bavaria [Germany]—died July 26, 1896, Stein), German entrepreneur who expanded a family pencil business into a worldwide firm preeminent in the manufacture of writing products and art supplies.
Taking over a pencil business started by his great-grandfather Kaspar Faber (died 1784) near Nürnberg, Lothar von Faber established branches of the company throughout Europe and in the United States and contracted (1856) for exclusive control of all graphite being mined in eastern Siberia at that time. He won (1881) a patent of nobility and an appointment as councillor of state for his services to German industry. The German branch of the company was renamed Faber-Castell in 1898 when Lothar von Faber’s granddaughter and heiress married Count Alexander zu Castell-Rüdenhausen, who took over the company’s management in 1900. Members of the Faber-Castell family continued to run the business into the 21st century.
