James Rowland Angell,  (born May 8, 1869, Burlington, Vt., U.S.—died  March 4, 1949, Hamden, Conn.), psychologist and university president who rebuilt and reorganized Yale University in the 1920s and ’30s.
A son of educator James Burrill Angell, the young Angell studied psychology at the University of Michigan under John Dewey, at Harvard University under William James and Josiah Royce, and at the Universities of Berlin and Halle. After a year as an instructor at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, Angell was asked by Dewey to be assistant professor of psychology at the new University of Chicago (1894). While there, he served successively as director of the psychological laboratory (1894–1901), professor and head of the psychology department (1905–19), dean of faculties (1911–19), and acting president (1918–19). During World War I he helped to develop intelligence testing for the U.S. Army. Angell was elected president of the American Psychological Association (1906) and later served as editor of Psychological Monographs (1912–22).
In 1920 Angell accepted the presidency of the Carnegie Corporation and in 1921 became the 14th president of Yale—at the time, a rare appointment for a non-Yale graduate. Under his administration (1921–37), Yale prospered intellectually, socially, and materially. His published works include several books on psychology as well as American Education (1937), The Higher Patriotism (1938), and War Propaganda and the Radio (1940).
