Sir William Haley, in full Sir William John Haley,  (born May 24, 1901, Jersey, Channel Islands—died September 6, 1987, Jersey), director general of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) from 1944 to 1952, editor of The Times of London from 1952 to 1966, and editor in chief of the Encyclopædia Britannica from 1968 to 1969.
Haley grew up on the island of Jersey and attended Victoria College there. In 1918 he began to study journalism, and in 1921 he secured his first newspaper employment at The Times, eventually being stationed in Brussels. He joined the editorial staff of the Manchester Evening News in 1922 and eight years later became director of Manchester Guardian and Evening News, Ltd. He held this post from 1930 to 1939. He was then its joint managing director from 1939 to 1943, during which period he was also a director of the Press Association and of Reuters, Ltd.
In 1943 he joined the BBC as editor in chief, and he became its director general a year later. There he became especially known for his promotion of the Third Program, the cultural-intellectual station.
In 1952 he became editor of The Times, a position that, since the days of John Thadeus Delane (editor from 1841 to 1877), had been considered the most important and influential in British journalism. Haley continued as editor until 1966; and, when The Times was acquired by R.H. Thomson, Baron Thomson, he was appointed (January 1, 1967) chairman of the newly formed Times Newspapers, Ltd. At The Times Haley was largely responsible for modernizing the format; in particular, he removed the classified advertisements from the first page, where they had been traditionally and somewhat eccentrically placed, and used the first page for prominent news, as did other newspapers.
In 1967 he was appointed editor in chief of the Encyclopædia Britannica, and he assumed his duties the following year, becoming involved in some of the early work on the 15th edition. Thereafter he entered semiretirement, serving as commissioner of appeal for income tax, Jersey, from 1971.
In 1946 he was created a Knight Commander of St. Michael and St. George and in 1948 a Chevalier of the French Legion of Honour.
