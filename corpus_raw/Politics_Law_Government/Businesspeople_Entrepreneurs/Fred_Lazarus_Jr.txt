Fred Lazarus, Jr.,  (born Oct. 29, 1884, Columbus, Ohio, U.S.—died  May 27, 1973, Cincinnati, Ohio), American merchandiser who parlayed his family’s small but successful department store into a $1.3 billion holding company known as Federated Department Stores.
At age 10 Lazarus began selling in his family’s department store, F. & R. Lazarus, in Columbus, Ohio. At 18 he left Ohio State University to work full time. The store operated on the belief that the customer had to be happy, and, as a result, business prospered.
Lazarus in 1921 suggested to a merchants group, the Retail Research Association, that all its members keep their books the same way in order to share profit and sales information. The idea was accepted. The group formed the Associated Merchandising Corp.
In 1930 Lazarus joined forces with the owners of William Filene’s Sons in Boston and of Abraham & Straus in Brooklyn and finally with the owners of Bloomingdale’s in Manhattan and formed Federated Department Stores. Lazarus took the leadership of Federated in 1945 at the age of 61 and developed it into a huge corporation before turning control over to his son Ralph in 1966. By that time the company had some 200 stores nationwide.
