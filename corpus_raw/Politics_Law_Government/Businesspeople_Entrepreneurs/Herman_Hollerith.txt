Herman Hollerith,  (born February 29, 1860, Buffalo, New York, U.S.â€”died November 17, 1929, Washington, D.C.), American inventor of a tabulating machine that was an important precursor of the electronic computer.
Immediately after graduation from the Columbia University School of Mines in 1879, Hollerith became an assistant to his teacher William P. Trowbridge in the U.S. census of 1880. During the next decade he taught briefly at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge; experimented on air brakes; and worked for the Patent Office in Washington, D.C. During all this time he was occupied with the problem of automating the tabulation work of the census. By the time of the census of 1890, he had invented machines to record statistics by electrically reading and sorting punched cards that had been numerically encoded by perforation position. (See the photograph.) The invention was a success in the United States but drew much more attention in Europe, where it was widely adopted for a number of statistical purposes. In 1896 Hollerith organized the Tabulating Machine Company, incorporated in New York, to manufacture the machines; through subsequent mergers it grew into the International Business Machines Corporation (IBM).
