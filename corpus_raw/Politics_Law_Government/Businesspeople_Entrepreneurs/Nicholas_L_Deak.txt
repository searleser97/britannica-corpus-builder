Nicholas L. Deak, in full Nicholas Louis Deak,  (born October 8, 1905, Transylvania, Hungary—died November 18, 1985, New York, New York, U.S.), banker and founder of an internationally renowned retail currency-exchange service and dealer in precious metals.
Deak received a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Neuchâtel, Switzerland, in 1929. He worked with the Hungarian Trade Institute (1930–35) and with the British Overseas Bank (1935–37) as manager of Hungarian and Romanian subsidiaries. For two years Deak worked in the economics department of the League of Nations. In 1939 he founded Deak & Company, but he closed the operation in 1942, when he joined the U.S. Army. He became a U.S. citizen in 1943 and eventually a senior intelligence officer in the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the forerunner of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
He resumed his business in 1946 and formed a partnership with the Perera group, a foreign-exchange dealer. Over the years Deak’s business expanded rapidly; at its height the parent company, Deak & Company, included three banks and some 70 international companies providing a variety of monetary services. In the late 1970s and early ’80s the company was shaken by a series of scandals involving the “laundering” of money; Deak & Company and two of its subsidiaries entered bankruptcy proceedings in 1984. In 1985 a mentally unbalanced woman murdered Deak in his office.
