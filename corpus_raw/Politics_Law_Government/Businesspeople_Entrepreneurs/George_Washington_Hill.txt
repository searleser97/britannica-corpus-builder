George Washington Hill,  (born Oct. 22, 1884, Philadelphia—died Sept. 13, 1946, Matapedia, Que., Can.), American businessman whose marketing efforts introduced women to cigarettes.
Leaving Williams College before he graduated, Hill in 1904 went to work at the American Tobacco Company, where his father served as vice president. When the company bought the line of Pall Mall cigarettes, the younger Hill was put in charge of sales, and the cigarettes became the most popular among Turkish tobaccos. In 1911, the company was divided into four large competing firms as a result of a major antitrust suit. The senior Hill became president of the new American, and his son became sales manager. Five years later, they introduced the Lucky Strike brand, and Hill made the new cigarette his pet project, designing its marketing and advertising campaign himself, though the campaign’s success was largely due to the work of groundbreaking publicist Edward Bernays. Hill became president of the firm upon his father’s death in 1925, and by the following year, Lucky Strike accounted for one-fifth of U.S. cigarette sales. In 1927 he created an industry sensation by gearing advertising toward women for the first time. Female movie stars and singers lauded the brand, and soon Luckys accounted for 38 percent of U.S. cigarette sales. At the beginning of the Great Depression, the company was thriving, and Hill’s total salary was more than $2,000,000. He strongly believed in advertising and invested heavily in radio air time, sponsoring Your Hit Parade and the Jack Benny Show. Hill was an early sponsor for Frank Sinatra, Ethel Smith, and Lawrence Tibbett.
