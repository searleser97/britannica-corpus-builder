Juan T. Trippe, in full Juan Terry Trippe,  (born June 27, 1899, Seabright, N.J., U.S.—died  April 3, 1981, New York, N.Y.), American pioneer in commercial aviation and one of the founders of the company that became Pan American World Airways, Inc.
Trippe was the son of a New York banker and broker of English descent, but he was named for Juanita Terry, the wife of a great-uncle. He graduated from Yale University. A pilot in World War I, Trippe established an “air taxi” service in 1922 with several surplus government aircraft. Three years later he and two former Yale classmates and another friend formed Colonial Air Transport, which began the first airmail contract route between New York City and Boston. In 1927 he arranged a merger between Colonial Air and two other small airlines, forming Pan American Airways, with himself as president. That year Pan American inaugurated the first international air service, flying between Havana, Cuba, and Key West, Fla.
Other firsts followed as Trippe shrewdly parlayed his contacts in government both in the United States and abroad into valuable airmail contracts, extending his company’s routes to Europe, Africa, South America, and the Orient. By 1930 Pan American was the largest air-transport company in the world and, for many years, flew more route miles than any other airline. Under Trippe’s direction Pan American became the first company to order commercial jets (1955) and one of the first to buy the wide-bodied Boeing 747 jet (1966) for long-distance travel. By the time Trippe retired as president and executive director of the company in 1968, however, Pan American had lost its preeminence in the industry owing to increased competition from other U.S. airlines.
