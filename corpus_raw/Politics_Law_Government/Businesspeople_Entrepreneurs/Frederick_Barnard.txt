Frederick Barnard, in full Frederick Augustus Porter Barnard,  (born May 5, 1809, Sheffield, Massachusetts, U.S.—died April 27, 1889, New York City, New York), scientist, educator, and for nearly 25 years president of Columbia College (now Columbia University) in New York City, during which time Columbia was transformed from a small undergraduate institution for men into a major university.
After graduating from Yale in 1828, Barnard held several academic posts before serving as president and chancellor of the University of Mississippi from 1856 to 1861, when he resigned because of his Union sympathies.
Until Barnard went to Columbia in 1864, he had always defended the traditional prescribed curriculum of the classics and mathematics and had opposed vocational or professional subjects. At Columbia, Barnard changed his views, urging the college to expand its curriculum and introduce the elective system into the last two undergraduate years, to best develop advanced scholarship leading to graduate and professional education. He argued that this was the best way to attract more students. He was instrumental in establishing the School of Mines and opening the university to women. Barnard College, which bears his name, was founded as a “women’s annex” in 1889 after the trustees had turned down his plan for coeducation at Columbia.
