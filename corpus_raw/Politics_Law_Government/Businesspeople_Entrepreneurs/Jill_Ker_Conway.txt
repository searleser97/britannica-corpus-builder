Jill Ker Conway, née Jill Ker,  (born October 9, 1934, Hillston, New South Wales, Australia—died June 1, 2018, Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.), Australian-born American scholar, the first woman president of Smith College (1975–85), whose research as a historian focused on the role of feminism in American history.
Jill Ker grew up in Coorain, a remote grasslands locale where her parents ran a sheep ranch. After her father’s unexpected death, her mother moved the family to Sydney. Ker was educated at Abbotsleigh, a private girls’ school, and at the University of Sydney, where she took an honours degree in history in 1958. Two years later, after her rejection by the Australian foreign service on the basis of her sex, she immigrated to the United States for graduate work.
While earning her doctorate at Harvard University (Ph.D., 1969), she met and married John Conway. The Conways then moved to Toronto. There she taught 19th- and 20th-century American history at the University of Toronto, where she also became one of five vice presidents of the university. In 1975 Conway became the first woman president of Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts, a position she held for a decade. In 1985 she became a visiting scholar and professor in the Science, Technology, and Society program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Conway’s work on feminism and history yielded such books as The Female Experience in 18th- and 19th-Century America (1982) and Women Reformers and American Culture (1987). After editing two anthologies (1992, 1996) of autobiographical writing by women, she explored the memoir as a literary form in When Memory Speaks: Reflections on Autobiography (1998). Conway wrote her own life story in The Road from Coorain (1989), which was adapted for television (2001); True North (1994); and A Woman’s Education (2001). She was also the author of Felipe the Flamingo (2006), a children’s book. Conway received the National Humanities Medal in 2013.
