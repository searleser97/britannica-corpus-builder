John Erskine,  (born Oct. 5, 1879, New York City—died  June 2, 1951, New York City), U.S. educator, musician, and novelist noted for energetic, skilled work in several different fields.
Erskine received his Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1903 and taught there from 1909 to 1937, earning a reputation as a learned, witty teacher and lecturer specializing in Elizabethan literature.
In 1925, when Erskine was in his 40s, his first novel was published. Soon after that, he appeared as a piano soloist for the New York Philharmonic, beginning a distinguished career as a concert pianist. He also served as president of the Juilliard School of Music, director of the Juilliard Musical Foundation, and director of the Metropolitan Opera Association.
Erskine wrote more than 45 books. He was particularly successful with his early satirical novels, which are legends retold with updated views on morality and society. These works include The Private Life of Helen of Troy (1925) and Adam and Eve (1927), the story of how Adam adjusts to his newfound social life with two women. Erskine also co-edited the Cambridge History of American Literature, 3 vol. (1917–19). He described various facets of his life in The Memory of Certain Persons (1947), My Life as a Teacher (1948), and My Life in Music (1950).
