Robert Bosch, in full Robert August Bosch,  (born Sept. 23, 1861, Albeck, near Ulm, Württemberg [Germany]—died  March 9, 1942, Stuttgart, Ger.), German engineer and industrialist who was responsible for the invention of the spark plug and magneto for automobiles and whose firm produced a wide range of precision machines and electrical equipment in plants throughout the world.
Trained in the United States, where he worked with the inventor Thomas A. Edison and his colleague the German electrical engineer Siegmund Bergmann, Bosch founded the manufacturing company that bears his name in Stuttgart in 1886. In 1902 his coworker G. Honold invented the Bosch spark plug, which greatly aided the development of the automobile. Bosch himself developed the Bosch magneto, a device used to generate current for the ignition in internal-combustion engines, and he worked on automobile lamps, horns, and oil-pump devices. Bosch’s social views were advanced for his time. He introduced an eight-hour day in 1906 and advocated industrial arbitration and free trade.
