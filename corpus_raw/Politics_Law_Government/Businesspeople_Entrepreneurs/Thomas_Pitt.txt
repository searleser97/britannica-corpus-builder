Thomas Pitt, byname Diamond Pitt,  (born July 5, 1653, Blandford St. Mary, Dorset, Eng.—died April 28, 1726, Swallowfield, Berkshire), British merchant whose involvement in the East India trade brought him into conflict with the British East India Company; later, the company made him governor of Madras, India. Pitt was the grandfather of William Pitt, the Elder, the great 18th-century British statesman.
Without receiving permission from the East India Company, Pitt began to trade out of Balasore, India, in 1674. The company retaliated by having him arrested (1683) and fined (1687). Nevertheless, he was elected to Parliament in 1689 and 1690, when he bought the manor of Old Sarum, thereby securing control of this parliamentary seat for his family.
In 1693 Pitt embarked on another trading venture in the East. Failing to put an end to his activities, the East India Company took him into its service in 1694 and appointed him president of Fort St. George, Madras (now Chennai), three years later. Dismissed from his post in 1709, he returned to England and resumed his seat for Old Sarum. In 1717 he sold an extremely valuable diamond to Philippe II, duc d’Orléans, regent of France; now known as the “Regent,” the jewel is in the Louvre Museum, Paris.
