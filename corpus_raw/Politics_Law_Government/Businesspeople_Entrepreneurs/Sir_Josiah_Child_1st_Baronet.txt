Sir Josiah Child, 1st Baronet,  (born 1630, London, England—died June 22, 1699, London?), English merchant, economist, and governor of the East India Company.
The son of a London merchant, Child amassed a fortune as supplier of food to the navy. He also became a considerable stockholder in the East India Company. His speeches and writings supporting the East India Company’s claims to political power and its right to restrict any competition with its trade brought him to the notice of the other shareholders. He became a director of the company in 1677 and was elected governor of the East India Company in 1681, serving in that post for most of the decade. For a time he was virtually the sole decision maker for the company, directing policy as if it were his private business. He was often openly accused of using the company to aggrandize his social, economic, and political position. He received his baronetcy in 1678.
Child made some important contributions to economics, especially Brief Observations Concerning Trade and the Interest of Money (1668) and A New Discourse of Trade (1668, 1690). He viewed Dutch prosperity as deriving in part from a low-interest-rate policy and in part from a relatively liberal trade policy. Because of this, he advocated a reduction in England’s maximum rate of interest from 6 to 4 percent. Child had a mercantilist preference for a large population and supported government relief for the poor and the unemployed. He also advocated proprietary rights of trade between Great Britain and its colonies.
