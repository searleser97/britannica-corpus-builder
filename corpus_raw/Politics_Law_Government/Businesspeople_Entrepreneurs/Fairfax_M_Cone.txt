Fairfax M. Cone, in full Fairfax Mastick Cone,  byname Fax Cone,  (born Feb. 21, 1903, San Francisco, Calif., U.S.—died  June 20, 1977, Carmel, Calif.), a founder and chairman of Foote, Cone & Belding, and one of the preeminent American advertising executives of the 20th century.
Cone’s father was a prospector and mining engineer, and his mother was a schoolteacher. He studied English at the University of California, working as a summertime copy boy on the San Francisco Bulletin. After graduation, Cone worked for three years as a clerk, writer, and illustrator in the classified advertising department of the San Francisco Examiner. He became a copywriter at the San Francisco office of Lord & Thomas in 1929.
Cone became manager of that office in 1939, and two years later he moved to New York City to take charge of the Lucky Strike cigarettes account, the largest at Lord & Thomas. It was Cone’s responsibility to deal with the client, the curmudgeonly and bombastic George Washington Hill of American Tobacco. In 1942 he became executive vice president at the firm’s Chicago headquarters. In the same year, Albert Lasker, the proprietor, decided to dissolve the agency and allow Cone and two fellow vice presidents, Emerson Foote and Don Belding, to reorganize it as Foote, Cone & Belding. By 1959 both Foote and Belding had retired, so Cone guided the agency single-handedly until his retirement in 1970.
Cone had great respect for the judgment of the supermarket shopper and strove for clarity and candour in advertising; he disliked copy that was facetious or “gimmicky.” He was noted for his devotion to educational and philanthropic projects.
