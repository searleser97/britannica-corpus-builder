Marshall Field,  (born Aug. 18, 1834, near Conway, Mass., U.S.—died  Jan. 16, 1906, New York City), American department-store owner whose pioneering activities in retail merchandising were continued and extended into publishing by successive generations of his family.
Born on a farm, Field became at 16 an errand boy in a dry-goods store in Pittsfield, Mass., where he developed rapidly into an adept salesman. After going to Chicago, he was hired in 1856 by the mercantile house of Cooley, Wadsworth and Company (afterward Farwell, Field and Company), in which he attained full partnership. In 1865 he and Levi Zeigler Leiter (1834–1904), one of his junior partners, joined the merchandising firm of Potter Palmer (1826–1902). When Palmer formally withdrew in 1867, the organization became known as Field, Leiter and Company and in 1868 rented from Palmer an ornate building on State Street to serve as their firm’s department store. In 1881 Field bought out Leiter for $2,500,000, changing the name of the firm to Marshall Field and Company. In an age of shoddy and unethical merchandising practices, Field instead emphasized customer service, stressing liberal credit, the one-price system, and the privilege of returning merchandise. He also introduced the department-store restaurant for shoppers.
Field left an estate valued at $125,000,000. Among his benefactions were gifts to the University of Chicago and the Columbian Museum, which later became the Field Museum of Natural History. His grandson Marshall Field III (1893–1956) founded the Chicago Sun (afterward the Chicago Sun-Times). Marshall Field IV (1916–65), the first Field’s great-grandson, followed by Marshall Field V (1941– ), became publisher of the Sun-Times and the Chicago Daily News (ceased publication in 1978) and chairman of the board of Field Enterprises, Inc. Field family members sold the Sun-Times in 1983.
