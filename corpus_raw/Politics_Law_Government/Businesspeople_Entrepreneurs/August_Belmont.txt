August Belmont, original name August Schönberg,  (born December 8, 1816, Alzey, Rhenish Prussia [now Germany]—died November 24, 1890, New York, New York, U.S.), German-born American banker, diplomat, political leader, sportsman, and a patron of the arts who was a defining figure of America’s Gilded Age.
At age 14 Belmont entered the banking house of the Rothschilds at Frankfurt am Main, and he later transferred to the Naples office. In 1837 he moved to New York and opened a small office on Wall Street, where he served as the American agent for the Rothschilds and laid the foundations for his own banking house (August Belmont & Company). He took an active interest in politics as a Democrat. From 1853 to 1855 he was chargé d’affaires for the United States at The Hague, and from 1855 to 1857 he served as resident minister there. Although he opposed slavery, he supported Stephen A. Douglas, the architect of the Kansas-Nebraska Act. After the American Civil War began, however, Belmont became a loyal supporter of Pres. Abraham Lincoln and exerted strong influence upon merchants and financiers in England and France in favour of the Union. He also served as chairman of the Democratic National Committee from 1860 to 1872.
Belmont, one of the richest Americans of his day, was a fixture of New York’s high society, and his lavish lifestyle reportedly inspired the character of Beaufort in Edith Wharton’s The Age of Innocence (1920). He was also a prominent figure in the establishment of Thoroughbred horse racing in the United States as a major financer of the first Belmont Stakes, part of the trio of races that compose the American Triple Crown. The event was subsequently named in his honour.
The Belmont family’s contributions to American history and culture did not end with those of the paterfamilias. Belmont’s eldest son, Perry Belmont (1851–1947), was a member of Congress (1881–88) and served as U.S. minister to Spain in 1888–89. Another son, August Belmont, Jr. (1853–1924), took a prominent part in financing and building the New York subway, was a major owner and breeder of Thoroughbred racehorses, helped build New York’s Belmont Park racetrack, and served (in his 60s) as a major in the U.S. Army during World War I.
