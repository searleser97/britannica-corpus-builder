Ohno Taiichi,   (born 1912, Manchuria, China—died  May 28, 1990, Toyota City, Japan), Japanese production-control expert for the Toyota Motor Co. whose just-in-time system (kanban) revolutionized manufacturing methods.
After graduating from Nagoya Technical High School (1932) Ohno joined Toyota and, about 20 years later, began implementing his cost-saving program. He served as assembly shop manager in Toyota’s vehicle-making operations, then quickly climbed the corporate ladder as his manufacturing expertise was recognized. His just-in-time method, in which parts are produced only as they are needed and are delivered to the production line just prior to their use, helped propel the once nearly bankrupt company into the position of third-largest automobile maker in the world, behind General Motors and Ford.
Ohno became executive vice president in 1975 and retired in 1978 but retained the role of consultant until 1982. He wrote the widely read books on manufacturing Toyota Production System (1978), Workplace Management (1984), and Just-in-Time for Today and Tomorrow (1988).
