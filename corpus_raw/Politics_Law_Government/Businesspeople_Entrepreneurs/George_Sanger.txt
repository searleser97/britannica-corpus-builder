George Sanger, byname Lord George,  (born Dec. 23, 1825, Newbury, Berkshire, Eng.—died Nov. 28, 1911, Park Farm, near Finchley, Middlesex),  English circus impresario who was the proprietor, with his brother John Sanger, of one of England’s biggest circuses in the 19th century. (See also circus: 19th-century developments.)
Sanger was an assistant in his father’s touring peep show. In 1853 he and his brother formed their own show, and by 1871 the two had leased Astley’s Amphitheatre in London and produced a massive traveling tent circus. They also held shows at Agricultural Hall in London. Sanger and his brother broke off their partnership in the late 1870s, and George went on to create his own shows. His memoir, Seventy Years a Showman, was published in 1908.
