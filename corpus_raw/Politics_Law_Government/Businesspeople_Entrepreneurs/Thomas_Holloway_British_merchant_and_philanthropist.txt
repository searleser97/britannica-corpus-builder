Thomas Holloway,  (born Sept. 22, 1800, Devonport, Devonshire—died  Dec. 26, 1883, Tittenhurst, Berkshire), patent-medicine merchant and philanthropist. In 1837 he began to sell an ointment that carried his name around the world, and soon added the sale of pills to his business. Advertising played a large part in his success, and from his wealth he endowed two institutions—a sanatorium for the mentally afflicted of the lower middle class, opened in 1885, and a college for women, opened at Egham in 1886.
