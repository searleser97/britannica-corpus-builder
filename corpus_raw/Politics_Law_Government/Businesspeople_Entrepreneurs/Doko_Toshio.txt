Dokō Toshio,  (born Sept. 15, 1896, Okayama prefecture, Japan—died  Aug. 4, 1988, Tokyo), Japanese businessman who was instrumental in revitalizing Japanese manufacturing after World War II, notably with the Toshiba Corporation and as chairman of Keidanren (1974–80), one of Japan’s main business organizations.
After graduating from Tokyo Technical Higher School (1920; renamed Tokyo Institute of Technology), Dokō worked for the Ishikawajima Shipyard Co. (renamed Ishikawajima Heavy Industries) first as a turbine designer and later as president (1950–60), during which time he revamped the firm in order to benefit from heavy U.S. procurement during the Korean War. He later presided over the newly merged Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co. Ltd. and oversaw the construction of the Idemitsu maru, the world’s largest tanker in the 1960s. As president (1965–72) and chairman (1972–76) of Toshiba, he raised the morale of both workers and management and steered the company to prosperity. Dokō was named chairman (1981) of the prime minister’s advisory council on administrative reform, a group that in 1983 recommended that the state-run Japan National Railways be privatized; the measure was implemented in 1987, when Japan Railways Group was established.
