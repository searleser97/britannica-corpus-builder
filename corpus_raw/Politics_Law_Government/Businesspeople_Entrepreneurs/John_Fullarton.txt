John Fullarton,  (born 1780?—died  Oct. 24, 1849), British surgeon and banker who wrote on currency control.
Fullarton, who was of Scottish origin, qualified as a doctor and went to India as a medical officer for the East India Company. While there he became a banker, joining a profession that influenced his later monetary views. He was also an extensive traveler, which also may have affected his views on the operation of the economic system.
Fullarton’s fame as an economist rests upon his book, On the Regulation of Currencies (1844), in which he criticized the proposal to control the money supply through control of the balance of payments. Fullarton believed that overissue of a convertible currency was impossible. His argument was that of the so-called antibullionist, or banking, school, which believed that the convertibility of notes was the only requirement for the stability of currency. Consequently, banks reflected, rather than caused, high prices by issuing currency. This view was opposed by what was known as the currency school, led by David Ricardo, which advocated the forced contraction of the money supply by the Bank of England in order to check high prices. Fullarton believed the balance of payments was independent of the state of the currency and any imbalance would be corrected by the introduction of precious metals from savings.
