Branch Rickey, in full Wesley Branch Rickey,  (born December 20, 1881, Stockdale, Ohio, U.S.—died December 9, 1965, Columbia, Missouri), American professional baseball executive who devised the farm system of training ballplayers (1919) and hired the first Black players in organized baseball in the 20th century.
Rickey started his professional playing career while studying at Ohio Wesleyan University, spent two seasons (1906–07) in the American League as a catcher, and graduated from the University of Michigan Law School in 1911. After serving as field manager of the American League St. Louis Browns (1913–15), he began a long association with the National League St. Louis Cardinals—as club president (1917–19), field manager (1919–25), and general manager (1925–42).
Dismayed at the inability of the Cardinals to bid successfully for promising minor league players, he persuaded club owner Sam Breadon to buy stock in the Houston (Texas) and Fort Smith (Arkansas) minor league teams so that St. Louis would have first choice of their players. The Cardinals won nine league championships with players signed during Rickey’s tenure. He left the Cardinals to become president and general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers of the National League (1943–50).
In the spring of 1945, Rickey founded the United States League for Black players, whom unwritten law excluded from organized baseball, and he was criticized for encouraging continued segregation in sports. There are no records indicating that the league ever played any games; however, it served as a front that allowed Rickey to quietly scout Black ballplayers for one who could lead the desegregation of the major leagues. In October 1945 he signed infielder Jackie Robinson for the Dodgers’ minor league organization. Robinson’s success with the Dodgers from 1947 led other owners to seek Black talent. Rickey later was vice president, general manager (1950–55), and chairman of the board (1955–59) of the Pittsburgh Pirates.
Rickey was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, in 1967.
