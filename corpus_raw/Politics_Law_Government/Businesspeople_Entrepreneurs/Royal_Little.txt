Royal Little,  (born March 1, 1896, Wakefield, Mass., U.S.â€”died  Jan. 12, 1989, Nassau, The Bahamas), American businessman and investor who founded Textron, Inc., the first major American corporation built on the concept of diversification, or conglomeration.
In spite of an academic probation, Little graduated from Harvard University in 1919. He subsequently began working for a synthetic-fibre company in South Boston. Little decided in 1923 to form his own company, Special Yarns Corp., which he did for $10,000 in borrowed cash. It began as a textile firm but was only marginally successful. In 1944 its name was changed to Textron, Inc.
By 1952, having become discouraged by the low rate of return on capital investment in the textile industry, Little reorganized his company and started it on a broad program of unrelated diversification. He had bought 40 firms by 1960, when he retired as chairman of the firm. Textron came to oversee the manufacture of a wide range of products, such as watchbands, chain saws, helicopters, radar antennas, snowmobiles, electronic equipment, and roller bearings. The company eventually became one of the largest conglomerates in the United States, and its success spurred other corporations to broadly diversify their industrial activities.
