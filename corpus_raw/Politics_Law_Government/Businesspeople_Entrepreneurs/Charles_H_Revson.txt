Charles H. Revson,  (born Oct. 11, 1906, Boston—died  Aug. 24, 1975, New York City), American businessman who turned a $300 investment into the largest retail cosmetics and fragrance manufacturing firm in the United States, with more than 3,000 products and annual sales at his death of $605,000,000.
The son of a cigar maker, Revson’s first job was in a dress store as a salesman. He soon joined a cosmetics firm and sold nail polish, but he quit in 1932 when he was passed over for the position of national distributor. That same year, during the depths of the Great Depression, Revson joined with his brother Joseph and a chemist, Charles Lachman, and started Revlon with $300 as capital. Their nail polishes were thick and smooth and were offered in more shades than any other company had. Revson concentrated his early sales in beauty salons and then later turned to drug and department stores. Revson was also the first to introduce matching lipsticks and polishes. He was a strong believer in advertising and developed exotic and romantic names for his products, such as Fire and Ice, Plum Lightning, Moon Drops, and Ultima II.
Revson had a reputation as a demanding perfectionist, and his firm had a high turnover in executives. Both of his original partners had resigned by 1965, and his other brother, Martin, who had joined the company in 1935, resigned in 1958. Revson diversified in 1966 into the pharmaceutical industry. At the time of Revson’s death from cancer, Revlon products were sold in 85 countries.
