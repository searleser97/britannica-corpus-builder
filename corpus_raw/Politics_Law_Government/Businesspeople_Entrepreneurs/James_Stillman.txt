James Stillman,  (born June 9, 1850, Brownsville, Texas, U.S.—died  Mar. 15, 1918, New York City), American financier and banker whose presidency of New York’s National City Bank (now Citibank) made it one of the most powerful financial institutions in the United States.
Beginning his career in a New York City mercantile house, Stillman became a protégé of Moses Taylor, then a wealthy merchant and banker. In 1891, having participated in a number of Taylor’s projects, Stillman succeeded Taylor’s son-in-law as president of the National City Bank.
By maintaining large cash reserves and drawing on powerful connections, such as his close friend William Rockefeller, Stillman’s bank prospered during the panic of 1893, more than doubling deposits and rising to a commanding position among U.S. banks. In 1897 he helped finance, in connection with Kuhn, Loeb, and Company, the reorganization of the Union Pacific Railroad. National City Bank later expanded into international markets, establishing a preeminence that it has retained since.
Deposits mushroomed during Stillman’s tenure from about $12,000,000 in 1891 to $638,000,000 at the time of his death. He left a personal fortune estimated at more than $50 million.
