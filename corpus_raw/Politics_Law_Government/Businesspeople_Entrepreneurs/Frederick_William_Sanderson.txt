Frederick William Sanderson,  (born May 13, 1857, Brancepeth, Durham, Eng.—died June 15, 1922, London), English schoolmaster whose reorganization of Oundle School had considerable influence on the curriculum and methods of secondary education.
In 1889 Sanderson became senior physics master at Dulwich College, London. In 1892 he was appointed headmaster of Oundle, near Peterborough, Northamptonshire, at a critical time in the fortunes of the school. He transformed Oundle by completing an ambitious building program that included laboratories, workshops, a foundry, an observatory, an experimental farm, and a spacious library. The science and engineering departments he established attracted many boys who had been uninterested in classics. In 1905 the students built a reversing engine for a 4,000-horsepower marine engine, and during World War I the school’s workshops were made into munitions shops.
