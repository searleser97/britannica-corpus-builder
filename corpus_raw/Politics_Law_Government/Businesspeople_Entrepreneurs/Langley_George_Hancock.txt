Langley George Hancock,  (born June 10, 1909, Perth, W.Aus., Austl.—died  March 27, 1992, Perth), Australian mining industrialist who unearthed some of the largest iron-ore reserves in the world, making him one of the nation’s richest citizens and financing his campaign to form a right-wing political party and to fight for Western Australian independence.
Hancock began prospecting while managing his family’s sheep station in the Hamersley Range. In the 1930s he and his business partner, Peter Wright, established an asbestos-treatment plant and a mining company to process the asbestos deposits he had discovered. In 1952 when he was forced to land his private aircraft in bad weather, he stumbled across vast iron-ore deposits in the Pilbara region of northwestern Western Australia. After convincing the authorities of his find, he and Wright founded Hamersley Iron and signed a royalty agreement with a major mining company. By the late 1960s Hancock had discovered hundreds of deposits that generated millions of dollars in annual royalties.
In 1974 Hancock founded the Westralian Secession Movement and the newspaper National Miner to advance his controversial ideas, which included the use of nuclear explosions to excavate mines and harbours and the introduction of sterilizing drugs to the drinking water of half-caste Aborigines. In the 1980s he arranged a controversial trade agreement with Romanian leader Nicolae Ceauşescu.
