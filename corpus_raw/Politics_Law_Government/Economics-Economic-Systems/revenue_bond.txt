Revenue bond, also called limited obligation bond,  bond issued by a municipality, state, or public agency authorized to build, acquire, or improve a revenue-producing property such as a mass transit system, an electric generating plant, an airport, or a toll road. Unlike general obligation bonds, which carry the full faith and credit of the issuing agency and are repaid through a variety of tax revenues, revenue bonds are payable from specified revenues only, usually the revenues from the facility for which the bond was originally issued.
This separation of the revenue bond obligation from a municipality’s direct and general bond obligations allows the municipality to circumvent legislated debt limits. Viewed in this light, revenue bonds can be considered a municipality’s corporate bonds, since they are free of ceilings, pay interest (often at rates higher than general obligation bonds), and are paid only from the profits of a revenue-producing property. In exchange for this freedom from debt limitation, municipalities are scrutinized on their use of revenues generated by the sale of the bonds.
