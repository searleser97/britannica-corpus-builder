Victor-Prosper Considérant,  (born Oct. 12, 1808, Salins, Fr.—died  Dec. 27, 1893, Paris), French Socialist who, after the death of Charles Fourier in 1837, became the acknowledged leader of Fourierist Utopianism and took charge of La Phalange, its theoretical organ.
Educated at the École Polytechnique in Paris, Considérant entered the French army as an engineer and rose to the rank of captain. He resigned his commission in 1831 to devote himself to advancing Fourierism.
After the revolution of 1848, Considérant was elected to the Constituent Assembly. In 1849, however, his political activity made it necessary for him to leave France. He settled in Brussels and visited the United States on several occasions. On his second visit to the U.S., he founded, near Dallas, Texas, the short-lived communistic colony of La Réunion (1855–57). He returned to Paris in 1869.
Among Considérant’s books, his Destinée sociale (1834–38) is considered the most important work of the Fourierist school.
