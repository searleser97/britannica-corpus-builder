Recession,  in economics, a downward trend in the business cycle characterized by a decline in production and employment, which in turn causes the incomes and spending of households to decline. Even though not all households and businesses experience actual declines in income, their expectations about the future become less certain during a recession and cause them to delay making large purchases or investments.
In recessions, the decline in output can be traced to a reduction in purchases of durable household goods by consumers and of machinery and equipment by businesses, and a reduction in additions of goods to stocks or inventories. The greatest effect is probably on inventory; businesses stop adding to their inventories and become more willing to draw on them to fill production orders. Inventory declines thus have a double impact on production volume.
Whether a recession develops into a severe and prolonged depression depends on a number of circumstances. Among them are the extent and quality of credit extended during the previous period of prosperity, the amount of speculation permitted, the ability of monetary policy and fiscal policy to reverse the downward trend, and the amount of excess productive capacity in existence.
