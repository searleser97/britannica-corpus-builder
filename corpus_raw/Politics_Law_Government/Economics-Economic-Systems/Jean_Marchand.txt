Jean Marchand,  (born Dec. 20, 1918, Champlain, Que., Can.—died  Aug. 28, 1988, Saint-Augustin, Que.), Canadian politician, president of the Confederation of National Trade Unions (1961–65), and one of the “three wise men” of Quebec, together with Pierre Elliott Trudeau and Gérard Pelletier.
After graduating from Laval University, Marchand became a prominent union leader in Quebec and helped engineer the defeat of the Union Nationale government in 1960. In 1965 Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson persuaded him to become a candidate for the Liberal Party, and in turn, Marchand convinced Trudeau and Pelletier to run for office; all three were elected and served in Pearson’s cabinet until 1968, when Pearson was succeeded by Trudeau. Marchand initially was minister for citizenship and immigration and later held the portfolios of manpower, forestry and rural development, regional economic expansion, transport, and environment. He was a strong federalist who promoted bilingualism and opposed separatism for Quebec.
He served in Trudeau’s cabinet until 1976, when he resigned to protest the government’s refusal to allow French Canadian pilots the right to communicate with air traffic controllers in French. He was named to the Senate in 1976 and served as speaker from 1980 to 1983, when he resigned to head the Canadian Transport Commission, a post he held until 1985. He was appointed to the Order of Canada in 1986.
