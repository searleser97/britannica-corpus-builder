Arsène-Jules-Étienne-Juvénal Dupuit,  (born May 18, 1804, Fossano, Piedmont, French Empire [now in Italy]—died September 5, 1866, Paris, France), French engineer and economist who was one of the first to analyze the cost-effectiveness of public works.
Dupuit studied at the École Polytechnique (Polytechnic School) in Paris and then joined the civil-engineering corps, rising to the rank of inspector general of bridges and highways. Through his professional work, he became interested in the economic problems associated with constructing public works and charging for their use. Dupuit concentrated on the benefits of public works over and above their cost to users. He was one of the first to develop the concept of a demand curve, and he pioneered the idea of diminishing marginal utility. In estimating the benefits of public works, he stressed the welfare enjoyed by a consumer in excess of the price paid—a phenomenon that was later given the name “consumer surplus” by British economist Alfred Marshall.
Dupuit is undoubtedly the founder of cost-benefit analysis of public works. He also analyzed price elasticity, which led to, among other ideas, the “Laffer curve” of taxation.
