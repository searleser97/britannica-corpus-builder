Elasticity,  in economics, a measure of the responsiveness of one economic variable to another. A variable y (e.g., the demand for a particular good) is elastic with respect to another variable x (e.g., the price of the good) if y is very responsive to changes in x; in contrast, y is inelastic with respect to x if y responds very little (or not at all) to changes in x.
Technically, the elasticity of y with respect to x is calculated as the ratio of the percentage change in the quantity of y to the percentage change in the quantity of x. In algebraic form, elasticity (E) is defined as E = %Δy/%Δx. Y is elastic with respect to x if E is greater than 1, inelastic with respect to x if E is less than 1, and “unit elastic” with respect to x if E is equal to 1.
Elasticity is a very important concept in economics. Several types of elasticities that are frequently used to describe well-known economic variables have acquired their own special names over time. These include, but are not limited to, the price elasticity of supply and demand (the elasticity of supply or demand with respect to price), the income elasticity of demand, the cross-price elasticity (the elasticity of the price of a good with respect to the price of another good), the elasticity of substitution between different factors of production (for example, between capital and labour), and the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (for example, the elasticity of consumption in the future relative to consumption in the present).
