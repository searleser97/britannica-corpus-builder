Eveline M. Burns, in full Eveline Mabel Burns, née Eveline Mabel Richardson,  (born March 16, 1900, London, Eng.—died Sept. 2, 1985, Newton, Pa., U.S.), British-born American economist and educator, best remembered for her role in creating U.S. social security policy and for her work to further public understanding of it.
Eveline Richardson worked as an administrative assistant in Great Britain’s Ministry of Labour while attending the London School of Economics. In 1922 she married Arthur Robert Burns, a fellow economist. In 1926 she earned her doctorate and was awarded the Adam Smith Medal for exceptional economic research. That same year Burns and her husband traveled to the United States on a fellowship, and in 1928 they accepted faculty positions at Columbia University in New York City. They became American citizens in 1937.
Burns’s experience with the British Ministry of Labour and her expertise in the field of social insurance made her an obvious choice for President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Committee on Economic Security, and Burns played a crucial part in drafting the Social Security Act of 1935. In 1936 she published Toward Social Security, an explanatory guide to the act written for a lay audience. Burns’s talent for illuminating complex economic subjects served her well as a textbook writer. Her landmark textbook, Social Security and Public Policy (1956), investigates the factors involved in economic policy decisions through comparative analysis. Throughout her career, in addition to teaching and writing books, Burns contributed numerous articles to professional journals and served as a consultant to several federal agencies. She held her professorship at Columbia until 1967.
