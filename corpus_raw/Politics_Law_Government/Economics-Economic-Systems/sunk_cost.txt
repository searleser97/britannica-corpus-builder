Sunk cost,  in economics and finance, a cost that has already been incurred and that cannot be recovered. In economic decision making, sunk costs are treated as bygone and are not taken into consideration when deciding whether to continue an investment project.
An example of a sunk cost would be spending $5 million on building a factory that is projected to cost $10 million. The $5 million already spent—the sunk cost—should not be taken into account when deciding whether the factory should be completed. What ought to matter instead are expectations of future costs and future returns once the factory is operational.
The reason economic analysis ignores sunk costs is that doing so helps to prevent decision makers from throwing good money after bad when they are stuck in an unprofitable project. It is often the case that heavy initial investment in a poor project results in a temptation to spend more money on the project in the hope of recovering the sunk cost or preventing embarrassment. Economic theory tries to solve that problem by focusing only on future costs and returns.
