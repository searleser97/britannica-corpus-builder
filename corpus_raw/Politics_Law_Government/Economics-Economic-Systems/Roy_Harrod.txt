Sir Roy Harrod,  (born Feb. 13, 1900, London—died  March 9, 1978, Holt, Norfolk, Eng.), British economist who pioneered the economics of dynamic growth and the field of macroeconomics.
Harrod was educated at Oxford and at Cambridge, where he was a student of John Maynard Keynes. His career at Christ Church, Oxford (1922–67), was interrupted by World War II service (1940–42) under Frederick Lindemann (later Lord Cherwell) as adviser to Winston Churchill. He was also an adviser to the International Monetary Fund (1952–53). He was knighted in 1959.
Harrod first formulated his concepts of growth dynamics in the 1930s and ’40s, emphasizing the analysis of the determining factors, rather than the quantities, of equilibrium growth rates. These ideas were put forth in Towards a Dynamic Economics (1948). The Harrod–Domar model of economic growth (named for Harrod and the U.S. economist E.D. Domar) has been applied to the problems of economic development.
Harrod also wrote International Economics (1933), The Trade Cycle (1936), Economic Essays (1952), The International Monetary Fund (1966), Towards a New Economic Policy (1967), and Economic Dynamics (1973) and, as a biographer, The Life of John Maynard Keynes (1951) and The Prof: A Personal Memoir of Lord Cherwell (1959). He also produced Foundations of Inductive Logic (1956) and Sociology, Morals and Mystery (1971).
