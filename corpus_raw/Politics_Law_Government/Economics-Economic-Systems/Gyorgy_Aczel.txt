György Aczél, original name Appel György,  (born Aug. 31, 1917, Budapest, Hung.—died Dec. 6, 1991, Budapest), politician, communist ideologist, and the preeminent personality in the cultural policy of the János Kádár regime (1956–88) in Hungary.
Born to a lower-middle-class Jewish family, Aczél joined the communist youth movement in 1935. After World War II he rose to the middle levels of the party hierarchy, but in a wave of purges that began in 1949 he was imprisoned on trumped-up charges; in 1954 he was released, and his name was cleared. Following the Hungarian uprising of 1956, he became a close colleague of Kádár, first secretary of the Hungarian Socialist Workers’ (i.e., Communist) Party. Aczél served twice as secretary of the party’s Central Committee (1967–74; 1982–85); he was a member of the Political Committee (1970–88); and he was deputy prime minister (1976–82). From the late 1960s until 1985 he ranked second or third in the party hierarchy. His influence later declined, in part perhaps because of Soviet pressure and in part because he was incapable of working with either the reformers or the hardliners in the party.
Aczél’s policies were inconsistent. Although he held conservative ideological and aesthetic views, his policies were liberal in comparison with other cultural politicians in the region. Aczél had a lively intellect, and he managed Hungarian cultural life by means of direct intervention, placing great importance on his personal connections with leading intellectuals.
