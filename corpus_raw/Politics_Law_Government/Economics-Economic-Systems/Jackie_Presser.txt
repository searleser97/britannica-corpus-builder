Jackie Presser,  (born August 6, 1926, Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.—died July 9, 1988, Lakewood, Ohio), American union leader and president (1983–88) of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, one of the nation’s largest unions.
Presser quit school after the eighth grade, joined the navy at age 17, and served in World War II. He then took a job with a local restaurant workers union in Cleveland, of which he was elected president in 1948. Presser later formed Teamsters Local 507 (1966), which grew from a dozen paint company workers to a union boasting some 6,000 members in Cleveland. As vice president and then president of the Ohio Conference of Teamsters during the 1970s, he attempted to improve the organization’s public image by sponsoring charitable activities and supporting government-sponsored job-retraining programs.
He succeeded his father, Bill Presser, as international vice president of the Teamsters in 1976. He used his influence to gain the union’s endorsement of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 U.S. presidential election and was named labour cochairman for Reagan’s inauguration. In 1983 Presser succeeded Roy Williams, who resigned as Teamsters president after being convicted of having conspired to bribe a U.S. senator. A 1986 report issued by the White House Commission on Organized Crime concluded that Presser had attained the union presidency with assistance from the New York-based Genovese crime family. In 1987 Presser helped the Teamsters rejoin the American Federation of Labor–Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL–CIO); the Teamsters had been expelled 30 years earlier for corruption and racketeering infractions. At the time of his death in 1988, Presser, along with other senior leaders of the Teamsters, was facing federal charges of embezzlement and racketeering. The suit was settled out of court in 1989.
