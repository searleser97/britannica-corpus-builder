Robert William Fogel,  (born July 1, 1926, New York, New York, U.S.—died June 11, 2013, Oak Lawn, Illinois), American economist who, with Douglass C. North, was awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics in 1993. The two were cited for having developed cliometrics, the application of statistical analysis to the study of economic history.
Fogel attended Cornell University (B.A., 1948), Columbia University (M.A., 1960), and Johns Hopkins University (Ph.D., 1963); he later received M.A. degrees from the University of Cambridge (1975) and Harvard University (1976). After teaching at Johns Hopkins and the University of Rochester, he joined the faculty of the University of Chicago (1964). He later accepted a position at Harvard (1975–81), after which he returned to Chicago.
Fogel first attracted attention in the early 1960s with his statistical analysis of the impact of railroads on 19th-century American economic development. Contrary to the thinking of the time, he argued that the building of railroads in the United States had contributed far less than had been believed to the overall growth of the economy. The publication in 1974 of Time on the Cross: The Economics of American Negro Slavery, which he wrote with Stanley L. Engerman, generated considerable controversy because it contended that slavery had been a profitable enterprise that had collapsed for political—rather than economic—reasons. The resulting furor over this theory caused Fogel to write a defense of his work, Without Consent or Contract: The Rise and Fall of American Slavery (1989), which included a moral condemnation of slavery and clarified his earlier research. His later publications include Economic Growth, Population Theory and Physiology: The Bearings of Long-Term Processes on the Making of Economic Policy (1994), The Fourth Great Awakening and the Future of Egalitarianism (2002), The Slavery Debates, 1952–1990: A Retrospective (2003), and The Escape from Hunger and Premature Death, 1700–2100: Europe, America, and the Third World (2004).
