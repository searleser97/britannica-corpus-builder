Gamonalismo,  a term meaning “bossism,” used in Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia. It is derived from gamonal, a word meaning a “large landowner,” and it refers to the exploitation of the Indian population, mainly by landowners of European descent. In the 1920s the Peruvian Marxist writer José Carlos Mariateguí attacked gamonalismo as the worst abuse in the Peruvian political system; in so doing he influenced many of his contemporaries to espouse Socialism.
