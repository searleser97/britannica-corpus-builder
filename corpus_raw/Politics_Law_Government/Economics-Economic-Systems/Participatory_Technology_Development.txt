Participatory Technology Development (PTD),  an approach to development that emerged during the 1980s and ’90s, involving collaboration between experts and citizens of less-developed countries to analyze problems and find solutions that are appropriate for specific rural communities. PTD was created in response to low rates of adoption of new agricultural technologies in developing countries. Although the approach has been applied most often to agricultural development, it has also been applied to other issues including natural resource management.
In PTD local practitioners and citizens (e.g., farmers and other village members) participate actively in the decision-making process in all stages of the development and implementation of the technology that they will be using. This approach is a marked departure from the top-down, researcher-driven process that was the norm in agricultural research and development work before 1980.
The Green Revolution of the 1960s and ’70s greatly improved the agricultural yield in many developing countries and helped save many from malnutrition and starvation. Great as those gains were, however, there remain some challenges for agriculture and development. Among these challenges are the need to promote equitable distribution of the benefits of increased agricultural production, to better manage the natural resources that support agriculture, and to strengthen the ability of local farming communities to improve their methods.
Addressing such challenges requires a shift in emphasis away from simply increasing agricultural production to broader considerations of how communities function and how people best respond to change. In PTD research and development is seen as an ongoing learning process involving the end users of new technology, rather than a top-down system in which modern technology is developed in one location (often in the industrialized world) and then simply transferred to the end users (often in the developing world).
