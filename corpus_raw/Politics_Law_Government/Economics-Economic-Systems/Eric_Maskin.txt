Eric S. Maskin, in full Eric Stark Maskin,  (born December 12, 1950, New York City, New York, U.S.), American economist who, with Leonid Hurwicz and Roger B. Myerson, received a share of the 2007 Nobel Prize for Economics for his work on mechanism design theory, a specialized form of game theory that attempts to maximize gains for all parties within markets.
Maskin studied at Harvard University, earning a bachelor’s degree in mathematics (1972) and a master’s degree (1974) and doctorate (1976) in applied mathematics. He taught economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1977–84) before becoming a professor at Harvard University (1985–2000). In 2000 he joined the faculty at Princeton University, where he was a visiting professor (2000–12) and the Albert O. Hirschman Professor of Social Science at the Institute for Advanced Study (2000–11). In 2012 he returned to Harvard.
With the concept of implementation theory, Maskin built on the mechanism design work of Hurwicz. Implementation theory introduced mechanisms to the market that would lead to optimal outcomes for all participants. This work had applications in the financial sector, in studies of voter behaviour, and in business management.
