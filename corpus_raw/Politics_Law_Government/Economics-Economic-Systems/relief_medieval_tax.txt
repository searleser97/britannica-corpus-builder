Relief,   in European feudalism, in a form of succession duty paid to an overlord by the heir of a deceased vassal. It became customary on the Continent by the Carolingian period (8th–9th century ad). The sum required was either fixed arbitrarily by the lord or agreed between the parties. Gradually, a concept of what constituted a just and reasonable sum emerged, usually the equivalent of one year’s revenue from the fief. This was standardized in England at £100 for a barony or honour (large landed fief) and 100 shillings for a knight’s fee. Heirs to smaller fiefs might give a knight’s horse and equipment.
