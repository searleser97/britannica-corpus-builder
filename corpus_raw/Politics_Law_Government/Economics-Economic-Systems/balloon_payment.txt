Balloon payment,  an unusually large payment that is due at the end of a consumer or mortgage loan period. In a loan that is structured with a balloon payment, the borrower makes small monthly payments while interest accrues on the larger remaining balance, causing the payment due at the end of the period to be inflated over time, like a balloon. A loan that has such a repayment structure is also called a partially amortized loanâ€”in contrast to a fully amortized loan, which is repaid in a fixed number of principle-plus-interest payments in equal amounts.
