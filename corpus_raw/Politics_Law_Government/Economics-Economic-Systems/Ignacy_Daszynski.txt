Ignacy Daszyński,  (born Oct. 26, 1866, Zbaraż, Galicia, [now Zbarazh, Ukraine]—died  Oct. 31, 1936, Bystra, near Cieszyn, Poland), Polish socialist leader and patriot who was prominent in the restoration of the Polish Republic after World War I.
In October 1892 Daszyński was one of the organizers of the Polish Social Democratic Party in Galicia. He was elected to the Austrian Reichsrat in 1897 and was a member of it until 1918. He was a remarkable parliamentary speaker and a champion of the people. From 1903 he took part in many congresses of the Socialist International, always insisting on the independence and reunification of all Polish lands as an integral part of the Polish socialist program. From 1912 he collaborated to this end with Józef Piłsudski, whom he then admired. Also in 1912 he became editor in chief of the Polish socialist daily newspaper Naprzód (“Forward”) in Kraków. Daszyński was the head of the first provisional government of restored Poland, formed at Lublin on Nov. 7, 1918. Elected on Jan. 26, 1919, to the Sejm (Diet), he was reelected in 1922, 1928, and 1930. From July 1920 to January 1921 he was deputy premier in the government of national unity presided over by Wincenty Witos. From 1928 to 1930, as speaker of the Sejm, he firmly defended the parliament’s prerogatives against Piłsudski’s autocratic tendencies. Daszyński became ill in 1931 and retired from public life.
