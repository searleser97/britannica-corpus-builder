Roy Lee Williams,  (born March 22, 1915, Ottumwa, Iowa, U.S.—died  April 28, 1989, Leeton, Mo.), American union leader, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (1981–83) before being convicted in 1982 with four others of conspiring to bribe Howard Cannon, U.S. senator from Nevada, to defeat a trucking industry regulation bill.
In 1935 Williams began his career by trucking livestock, and he later became active in the leadership of the Teamsters’ Local 41 in Kansas City, Mo. As a union executive, he gained a reputation as a forceful bargainer with notable expertise in trucking contracts. His rise to power was aided by onetime Teamsters president James R. Hoffa, and in spite of a pending indictment on charges involving union misdeeds and reported links to organized crime, Williams was elected president of the Teamsters in 1981.
During his imprisonment, Williams testified as a government witness in criminal court cases; in 1987 he disclosed that he had been controlled by Nick Civella, who was identified at the trial as a Mafia boss in Kansas City. As a result of his testimony, the ailing Williams was paroled in August 1988 after serving only 34 months of his 10-year prison sentence.
