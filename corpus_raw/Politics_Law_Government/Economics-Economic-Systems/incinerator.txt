Incinerator,  container for burning refuse, or plant designed for large-scale refuse combustion. In the second sense, an incinerator consists of a furnace into which the refuse is charged and ignited (usually by a gas burner), a secondary chamber in which burning the refuse at a high temperature is continued to complete the combustion process, and flues to convey the gases to a chimney. Auxiliary equipment may include steam boilers for using waste heat to generate electricity or to heat nearby buildings.
Modern incinerators include air pollution control equipment (e.g., fabric filters, scrubbers, electrostatic precipitators) to remove fly ash and gaseous contaminants. Tall chimney stacks serve to discharge the cleaned flue gases at heights that increase dilution and dispersion rates, further reducing air pollution.
Incinerator plants usually include facilities for unloading and storing refuse for short periods to permit uniform charging of the furnaces and, sometimes, rough sorting or classification of the refuse.
Incineration facilitates refuse disposal by reducing the solid waste of a community to about 10 percent of the original volume. See also solid-waste management.
