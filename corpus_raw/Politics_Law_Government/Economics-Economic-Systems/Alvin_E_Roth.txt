Alvin E. Roth, in full Alvin Eliot Roth,  (born December 18, 1951, New York City, N.Y., U.S.), American economist who was a pioneer of market design, a field that devises systems for matching supply with demand until a stable market has been established. With the American economist Lloyd Shapley, he was awarded the 2012 Nobel Prize for Economics.
Roth grew up in Queens, New York. He left high school early and received a B.S. (1971) from Columbia University and an M.S. (1973) and a Ph.D. (1974) from Stanford University. All his degrees were in operations research, a field of engineering that applies scientific principles to the solution of administrative problems. Roth applied the science to business and economics, which he taught at the University of Illinois (1974–82), the University of Pittsburgh (1982–98), Harvard University (1998–2012), and Stanford (2012– ).
Roth’s main interest was game theory, a field of applied mathematics that seeks solutions for situations where multiple players make interdependent decisions. He found particular inspiration in the so-called “deferred acceptance” algorithm, a set of rules devised in the 1960s by Shapley and American economist David Gale for ensuring that pairs of players in a freely trading system are efficiently matched up. In the mid-1990s Roth and colleagues modified the algorithm to improve a system that matched graduates of medical schools with hospitals seeking resident physicians. In 2003 his team applied a similar solution to a system matching students with high schools in New York City. Also in 2003 he began designing a system in which kidney donors could “trade” their organs to ensure that their intended recipients received compatible transplants. His work was cited by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences as an example of finding “practical solutions to real-world problems.”
