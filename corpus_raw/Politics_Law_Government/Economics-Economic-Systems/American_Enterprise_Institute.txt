American Enterprise Institute (AEI),  a private nonprofit American institution of research founded in 1943 by American industrialist Lewis H. Brown. One of the oldest and most-influential think tanks in the United States, it supports limited government, private enterprise, and democratic capitalism. Its headquarters are in Washington, D.C.
AEI originally consisted of 12 resident thinkers who set up the institute to serve as an advocate for big business and the promotion of free enterprise. It became a major research organization and think tank in the 1970s, under the leadership of William Baroody, Sr., who served as president of the institute until 1978. During his presidency the AEI expanded to 145 resident scholars, 80 adjunct scholars, and a large support staff.
From its founding the AEI played a prominent role in politics in the United States, and people affiliated with the organization have served in influential government positions. Its influence grew stronger during the administration of Pres. George W. Bush, in which Dick Cheney, an AEI member, served as vice president of the United States. Also, because most of the AEI’s board of directors are typically CEOs of major U.S. companies, the organization can also exercise considerable influence through its connections in the business world.
The AEI’s operations are financed by contributions from foundations, corporate sponsors, and individuals. The AEI maintains close ties with scholars and fellows at research universities in the United States who conduct research for the institute and attend its conferences. The institute publishes research articles, books, and the policy magazine The American.
