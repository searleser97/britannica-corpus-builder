digital certificate, also called public-key certificate,  electronic file that typically contains identification information about the holder, including the person’s public key (used for encrypting and decrypting messages), along with the authority’s digital signature, so that the recipient can verify with the authority that the certificate is authentic. Digital certificates are issued by certification authorities. Websites usually also have digital certificates, to enable a person intending to buy its products to confirm that it is an authenticated site. Such certificates serve as the security basis for HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure).
