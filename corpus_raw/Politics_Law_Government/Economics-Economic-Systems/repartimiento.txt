Repartimiento, (Spanish: “partition,” “distribution”)  also called mita, or cuatequil,  in colonial Spanish America, a system by which the crown allowed certain colonists to recruit indigenous peoples for forced labour. The repartimiento system, frequently called the mita in Peru and the cuatequil (a Spanish-language corruption of Nahuatl coatequitl or cohuatequitl) in New Spain (Mexico), was in operation as early as 1499 and was given definite form about 1575. About 5 percent of the indigenous peoples in a given district might be subject to labour in mines and about 10 percent more for seasonal agricultural work. A colonist who wanted a repartimiento had to apply to the viceroy or the audiencia (provincial appeals court), stating that the supplemental labour required on his plantation or ranch or in his mine would provide the country with essential food and goods.
Legally, the work period was not to exceed two weeks (five in the mines), three or four times annually, and wages were to be paid. Those requirements were practically ignored, however, and, because the forced labourers were often brutally treated, the Spanish government modified the system in 1601 and 1609. Under the new arrangement, 25 percent of the indigenous peoples in a given district were required to work for the Spaniards, but they were free to choose their own employer and term of service. The former system was permitted to continue in the mines until the owners could purchase enough enslaved African people to replace the indigenous workers. The new system remained legally in force down to the end of the colonial period (c. 1820). In practice, however, impressment of indigenous peoples under the earlier system continued in spite of additional royal prohibitive legislation in the 17th and 18th centuries. See also encomienda.
