Nouriel Roubini,  (born March 29, 1958, Istanbul, Turkey), Turkish-born American economist and educator who was best known for predicting the 2007–08 subprime mortgage crisis in the United States and the subsequent global financial crisis.
Born to Iranian Jewish parents, Roubini moved with his family to Iran and Israel before they settled in Italy in 1962. After a year at Hebrew University of Jerusalem, he studied economics at Bocconi University in Milan (B.A., 1982) and Harvard University (Ph.D., 1988), where he specialized in macroeconomics and international economics. He joined the economics faculty at Yale University in 1988 and taught there until 1995, when he moved to New York University. He also served as a visiting scholar to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), was a research associate with the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), held single-year terms on the White House Council of Economic Advisers (1998–99) and at the U.S. Department of the Treasury (1999–2000), and cofounded (2004) the consulting firm Roubini Global Economics. Roubini spent much of his early career studying countries that experienced extreme economic failures, such as Mexico (in 1994), Thailand and other countries associated with the 1997 Asian financial crisis, Russia (1998), and Argentina (2000). He determined that each shared one common element: a massive current account deficit.
Roubini, who had earned the nickname “Dr. Doom,” began looking for the next national economy most likely to collapse, and the data led him to the United States. He presented his findings in a speech to the IMF in September 2006. Many in the audience dismissed his prediction of an impending deep, painful recession marked by the tumultuous burst of a housing bubble, mortgage defaults, a collapse in real-estate values, and economic repercussions that would shock financial markets around the world. When his predictions came true in 2007–08, some critics asserted that it was a lucky call; they portrayed Roubini as a chronic pessimist (or “permabear”) who used any number of reasons over the years to predict and explain a market collapse. Despite the criticism, Roubini’s Web site, RGE Monitor (founded in 2005), became a central source for economic analysis of the global credit crisis. In 2010 he published Crisis Economics: A Crash Course in the Future of Finance (cowritten with Stephen Mihm).
