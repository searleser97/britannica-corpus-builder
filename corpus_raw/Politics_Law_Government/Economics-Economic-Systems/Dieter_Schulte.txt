Dieter Schulte,  (born Jan. 13, 1940, Duisburg, Ger.), German labour leader who served as chairman of the German Trade Union Federation (Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund; DGB) from 1994 to 2002, best known for organizing large protest rallies.
Schulte worked as an apprentice bricklayer and laid furnace bricks for the steel giant Thyssen before beginning his labour career at age 25. In the late 1970s he helped IG Metall, Germany’s largest trade union, negotiate a major industrial dispute with Thyssen. He was elected to IG Metall’s board in 1991. After the death of DGB leader Heinz-Werner Meyer in 1994, Schulte was drafted for the job because of his experience.
As leader of the DGB, Schulte oversaw the needs of 15 major trade unions and coped with opposition from the government, employers, and even employees who had begun to negotiate directly with employers without the help of the unions. While some members pledged limited allegiance to the union, younger workers were reluctant to join, because they did not see the unions as beneficial, especially since the high unemployment rate remained unchanged. Schulte claimed, however, that the decline in union membership had not drastically affected his still-powerful organization.
During 1996 German postal and public-sector workers held a series of “warning” strikes and protests opposing Chancellor Helmut Kohl’s plans to cut social benefits and slash public spending. Schulte and the 10-million-strong DGB organized that year’s largest protest rally, held in Bonn on June 15 and bringing together 350,000 demonstrators, including union activists, church group representatives, students, and government-opposition leaders.
