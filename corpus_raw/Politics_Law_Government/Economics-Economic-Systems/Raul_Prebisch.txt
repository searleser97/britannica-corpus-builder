He also advocated the economic integration of Latin America to achieve economies of scale and land reform to reduce the income inequalities that impeded the growth of the domestic market. As the influential head of the UN’s Economic Commission for Latin America, he addressed inequities in the trade relationships between wealthy and poor nations.
