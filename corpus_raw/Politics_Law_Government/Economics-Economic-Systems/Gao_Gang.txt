Gao Gang, Wade-Giles romanization Kao Kang, original name Gao Chongde,  (born Oct. 25, 1905, Hengshan, Shaanxi province, China—died Aug. 17, 1954, Beijing), one of the early leaders of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and one of the most important figures in the communist government established after 1949. His purge in 1954–55 was the biggest scandal in the Chinese communist movement from the mid-1930s to the 1960s.
Gao joined the CCP in 1926 and spent much of the next 10 years participating in communist guerrilla operations in his home province, Shaanxi. In the early 1930s he helped establish a communist guerrilla base on the Shaanxi-Gansu provincial border. When the main Red Army under Mao Zedong occupied the area after completing the Long March (October 1935), Gao became an important communist official. By the early 1950s he was a full Politburo (Political Bureau) member, one of Mao’s closest comrades, and the party and government head of the country’s single most industrialized area, Manchuria (now Northeast China). Gao exercised virtually autonomous power in Manchuria and as such was the country’s most powerful regional leader. He committed suicide before he was expelled from the CCP in March 1955 and then, in April, was publicly condemned by the party for deviating from communist policies.
