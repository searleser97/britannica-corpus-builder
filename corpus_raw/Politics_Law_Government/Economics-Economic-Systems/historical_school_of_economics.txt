Historical school of economics,  branch of economic thought, developed chiefly in Germany in the last half of the 19th century, that sought to understand the economic situation of a nation in the context of its total historical experience. Objecting to the deductively reasoned economic “laws” of classical economics, proponents of the historical approach favoured an inductive method that would encompass the continuing development of the entire social order; economic motives and decisions were seen as only one component of the social order. Members of both the earlier and the later historical schools viewed government intervention in the economy as a positive and necessary force.
Founders of the earlier school included Wilhelm Roscher, Bruno Hildebrand, and Karl Knies, whose works developed the idea of a historical method. They held that the merits of economic policies depended on place and time but that by studying various societies it would be possible to specify certain general stages of development through which all countries must pass.
The later historical school (roughly after 1870) was responsible for most of the detailed historical research for which the school as a whole is known. Its primary founder was Gustav von Schmoller, who hoped to identify cultural trends through extensive historical inquiry. Other prominent members of this school were Georg Friedrich Knapp and Lujo Brentano. Although the historical school was most influential in Germany, its impact was felt throughout Europe and the United States, particularly by the American institutional economists. Because they rejected economic theory, however, members of the historical school had little impact on theoretical development.
