Adolphe Blanqui, in full Jérôme-adolphe Blanqui,  (born Nov. 21, 1798, Nice, France—died  Jan. 28, 1854, Paris), French liberal economist whose History of Political Economy in Europe (1837–38) was the first major study of the history of economic thought.
In 1833 Blanqui succeeded Jean-Baptiste Say, under whom he had studied, to the chair of political economy at the Conservatory of Arts and Trades. Blanqui’s work blended theoretical and empirical approaches in an analysis of industry and commerce. He devoted himself to examining the conditions of the working class. Though he advocated government action in the protection of the worker, he remained a liberal in the tradition of Adam Smith.
