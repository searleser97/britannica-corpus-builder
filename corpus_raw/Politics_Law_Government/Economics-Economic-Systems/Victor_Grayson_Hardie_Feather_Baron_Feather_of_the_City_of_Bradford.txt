Victor Feather, Baron Feather of the City of Bradford,  (born April 10, 1908, Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, Eng.—died  July 28, 1976, London), British trade unionist who led the Trades Union Congress (TUC) in its confrontations with governments over industrial-relations legislation from 1969 to 1973.
Feather grew up in the industrial town of Bradford in the West Riding of Yorkshire. After working briefly in a textile mill, he became at age 14 an employee of the Bradford Co-operative Society. By age 15 he was a shop steward for the local union and, by age 21, chairman of the branch committee.
He joined the TUC staff in 1937, became assistant secretary (1947–60), assistant general secretary (1960–69), and finally general secretary in 1969. The main issues during his leadership of the TUC were the legislative proposals of the Labour government set out in its 1969 White Paper In Place of Strife, which had to be scrapped, and the following Conservative government’s Industrial Relations Act of 1971; union opposition to this act brought the government down and cost Edward Heath the leadership of the Conservative Party.
Feather was made a life peer in 1974. On retiring in 1973 he became president of the European Trade Union Confederation, a governor of the British Broadcasting Corporation and the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, and (1974) a member of the Arts Council.
