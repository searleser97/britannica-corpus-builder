Étienne Cabet,  (born Jan. 1, 1788, Dijon, Fr.—died Nov. 8, 1856, St. Louis, Mo., U.S.), French socialist and founder of a communal settlement at Nauvoo, Ill.
After a career as a teacher, lawyer, revolutionist, and political exile, Cabet published a novel, Voyage en Icarie (1840), setting forth his theories on the ideal community. Seeking to put his ideas into practice, he and several hundred followers landed in New Orleans in 1848 and 1849. He purchased the old Mormon settlement at Nauvoo and led 280 settlers there to start Icaria. The settlement was at best a compromise, for Cabet was unable to put many of his ideas into practice. The population never exceeded 1,800. In 1856 dissension arose, and Cabet left with 180 followers for St. Louis, where he soon died. Colonies of Icarians were established at Cheltenham, near St. Louis; at Corning, Iowa (dissolved 1884); and at Cloverdale, Calif. (dissolved 1895). See also Nauvoo.
