Albert Schäffle,  (born Feb. 24, 1831, Nürtingen, Württemberg—died  Dec. 25, 1903, Stuttgart), economist and sociologist who served briefly as Austrian minister of commerce and agriculture (1871); he was responsible for a major plan of imperial federalization for the Bohemian crownland.
Schäffle became a professor of political economy at Tübingen (1860) and later Vienna (1868). He was a member of the Württemberg Landtag (assembly) from 1862 to 1865, and in 1868 a delegate to the new German federal customs parliament (Zollparlament). Despite his reputation for radicalism, he was appointed to the Cabinet of the Austrian prime minister Karl, Graf von Hohenwart, in February 1871. The most forceful member of the Cabinet, he devised a scheme for redefining the position of Bohemia within the empire—the so-called Fundamental Articles (Fundamentalartikeln). The plan, vigorously denounced by Germans and Magyars alike, was shelved and the Cabinet was forced from office (October 1871).
Outside the government, Schäffle’s ideas nonetheless continued to exert influence in matters of political and social welfare legislation, not only in Austria but also in Germany. He left a considerable written corpus in the fields of economics and sociology and also two volumes of posthumously published memoirs.
