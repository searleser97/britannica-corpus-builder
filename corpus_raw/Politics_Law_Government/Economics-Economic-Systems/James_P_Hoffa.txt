James P. Hoffa, in full James Phillip Hoffa,  (born May 19, 1941, Detroit, Michigan, U.S.), American labour leader elected general president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT) in 1998 and son of former Teamsters president James R. Hoffa.
On his 18th birthday Hoffa was sworn in as a Teamster by his father. He studied economics at Michigan State University (B.A., 1963) and law at the University of Michigan (L.L.B., 1966). From 1968 to 1993 he worked as an attorney representing clients of the Teamsters. He first sought the office of the Teamsters presidency in 1991, but federal officials ruled him ineligible because he had never officially worked as a Teamster. As a means of gaining on-the-job experience, Hoffa began working as an administrative assistant to Lawrence Brennan, president of Michigan Joint Council 43, in 1993. Hoffa ran for president of the Teamsters in 1996 but lost the close, bitter election to incumbent Ron Carey. A funding scandal caused Carey to be unseated late in 1997, and Hoffa won the presidency through a special election in December 1998.
As president, Hoffa opposed trade agreements that appeared to threaten American jobs and pushed to have the Teamsters removed from Department of Justice oversight that had been initiated in 1989. He was reelected in 2001.
