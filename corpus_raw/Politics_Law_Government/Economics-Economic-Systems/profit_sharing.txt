Profit sharing,  system by which employees are paid a share of the net profits of the company that employs them, in accordance with a written formula defined in advance. Such payments, which may vary according to salary or wage, are distinct from and additional to regular earnings.
Profit-sharing plans can be traced to France, where they were used in the first half of the 19th century to boost productivity and to reduce animosity between workers and owners. They were adopted later in many other countries and currently exist, in various forms, throughout much of western Europe, the United States, and parts of Latin America.
Profit shares may be distributed on a current or deferred basis or by some combination of the two. Under current distribution, profits are paid to employees in a lump sum of cash or as company stock. In deferred-payment plans, profit shares may be paid into a managed fund from which employees can draw later. Some companies that offer profit sharing in the form of ownership shares occasionally invite employees to participate in the firm’s management.
Employers usually prefer a profit-sharing plan to wage increases or cost-of-living adjustments because the profit-sharing distributions are made only if a profit is earned—which means that the company is more able to afford the distribution. Profit-sharing plans also benefit employers by giving workers a direct incentive to increase their productivity. In addition, waste is reduced because a portion of each worker’s income is linked to the employer’s profit.
