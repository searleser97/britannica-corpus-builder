Barriers to entry,  in economics, obstacles that make it difficult for a firm to enter a given market. They may arise naturally because of the characteristics of the market, or they may be artificially imposed by firms already operating in the market or by the government.
Natural barriers to entry usually occur in monopolistic markets where the cost of entry to the market may be too high for new firms for various reasons, including because costs for established firms are lower than they would be for new entrants, because buyers prefer the products of established firms to those of potential entrants, or because the industry is such that new entrants would have to command a substantial share of the market before they could operate profitably. Because they are effectively shielded from competition, established firms in monopolistic markets are able to charge higher prices. That fact is one of the main reasons why governments regulate monopolistic industries such as utilities, airlines, and insurance, among others.
Artificial barriers to entry may arise when firms in a certain market engage in practices that make it more difficult for other firms to enter. For example, established firms may participate in predatory pricing by deliberately lowering their prices to prevent new entrants from making a profit. Artificial barriers also arise when a certain industry is protected by government regulations, licenses, or patents.
All forms of barriers to entry result in a decrease in competition.
