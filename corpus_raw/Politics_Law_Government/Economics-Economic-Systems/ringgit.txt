Ringgit,  monetary unit of Malaysia. The ringgit, also known as the Malaysian dollar, is divided into 100 sen. The Central Bank of Malaysia (Bank Negara Malaysia) has the exclusive authority to issue banknotes and coins in Malaysia. Coins are issued in denominations ranging from 5 to 50 sen. Banknote values are denominated from 1 to 100 ringgit. The obverse of each of the colourful bills contains a picture of Tuanku (King) Abdul Rahman, Malaysiaâ€™s first yang di-pertuan agong (paramount ruler). The reverse of most bills contains images related to Malaysian culture, natural wonders, flora and fauna, and technological and economic achievements. For example, the rhinoceros hornbill is featured on the 5-ringgit note; the Rafflesia azlanii, a flower indigenous to peninsular Malaysia, is the subject of the 10-ringgit note; and an oil palm, the source of palm oil, a major export of Malaysia, is on the 50-ringgit note. The ringgit was established as the official monetary unit of Malaysia in 1946, when it replaced the Straits Settlement dollar, a colonial currency created in the mid-19th century.
