Student aid,   form of assistance designed to help students pay for their education. In general, such awards are known as scholarships, fellowships, or loans; in European usage, a small scholarship is an exhibition, and a bursary is a sum granted to a needy student. Many awards are in the nature of long-term loans with low rates of interest. In many countries, government subsidies reduce or eliminate tuition and the cost of room and board and other expenses, and in still others students receive allowances for extra expenses. Even in some countries where tuition charges are appreciable, as in Great Britain, a scholarship program supported both by governments and by universities effectively underwrites this cost for most students.
During the latter half of the 20th century, a striking growth in higher education throughout the world has been greatly fostered by student-aid programs. Thus, opportunities for higher education, once limited to an economic and social elite, have become increasingly available to promising students with little money. Students receiving some form of private or public support constitute in all countries an important, and in some an overwhelming, proportion of university enrollment.
The United States has several major scholarship programs, but the number of students in that country receiving government financial aid is proportionately less than in most other countries. U.S. students receive greater support from universities as well as from corporations, foundations, and religious, civic, and other groups.
