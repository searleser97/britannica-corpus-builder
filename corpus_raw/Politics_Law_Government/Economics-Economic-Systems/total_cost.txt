Total cost,  in economics, the sum of all costs incurred by a firm in producing a certain level of output. It is typically expressed as the combination of all fixed costs (e.g., the costs of a building lease and of heavy machinery), which do not change with the quantity of output produced, and all variable costs (e.g., the costs of labour and of raw materials), which do change with the level of output. If fixed costs are not altered (e.g., by obtaining a larger building or by acquiring more heavy machinery), the rate of increase of variable costs with increasing output will be progressively greater in the long run, owing to diminishing returns on additional units of output. In other words, in the long run, progressively fewer units of output will be yielded by additional inputs of variable costs.
The notion of total cost is used to define average cost (the average cost of a unit of output is the total cost divided by the number of units produced) and marginal cost (the marginal cost of a given unit of output is the increase in the total cost required to produce that unit).
