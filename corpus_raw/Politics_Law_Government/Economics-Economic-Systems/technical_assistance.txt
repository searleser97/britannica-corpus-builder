Technical assistance,   form of aid given to less-developed countries by international organizations such as the United Nations (UN) and its agencies, individual governments, foundations, and philanthropic institutions. Its object is to provide those countries with the expertise needed to promote development. Most technical-assistance programs began after World War II, when much of Europe and Southeast Asia lay in ruins and the countries of Africa and Central and South America were attempting to improve their standards of living. The U.S. president Harry Trumanâ€™s Point Four Program (q.v.), announced in 1949, was a notable early example. Technical assistance may involve sending experts into the field to teach skills and to help solve problems in their areas of specialization, such as irrigation, agriculture, fisheries, education, public health, or forestry. Conversely, scholarships, study tours, or seminars in developed countries may be offered, giving individuals from less-developed nations the opportunity to learn special skills that they can apply when they return home. Vocational guidance, management development, business administration, home economics, mathematics, science, accounting, trade skills, urban planning, and legal services are a few of the many areas in which technical assistance has been provided.
Many governments furnish technical assistance to depressed urban or rural localities or needy groups within their borders. For example, the United States provides technical assistance for migrant workers, Indian reservations, run-down urban neighbourhoods, and small farmers.
The largest technical-assistance programs are those administered by the UN and its agencies. They are financed by voluntary contributions from members and concentrate on four major areas: agricultural production, basic-resource surveys and administrative services, health services, and education.
