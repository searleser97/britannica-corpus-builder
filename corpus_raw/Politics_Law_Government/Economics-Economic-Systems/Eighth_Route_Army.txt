Eighth Route Army,  larger of the two major Chinese communist forces that fought the Japanese from 1937 to 1945. The Eighth Route Army also engaged in political and propaganda work, helping to increase communist support among the populace. The army grew from 30,000 troops in July 1937 to 156,000 in 1938 and 400,000 in 1940. Reduced to about 300,000 by the fierce fighting between 1941 and 1944, its size almost doubled to a total of 600,000 men in 1945.
Formed in 1937 at the time of the second United Front (the anti-Japanese alliance between the Chinese Nationalists under Chiang Kai-shek and the Chinese Communists), the Eighth Route Army was headed by Mao Zedong’s old comrade in arms Zhu De but was placed under the overall direction of the Nationalist government. In 1938 the Eighth Route Army was reorganized as the Eighteenth Army Group under the Nationalist commander Yan Xishan. In practice, however, the army remained under Zhu De’s control and operated independently of the Nationalists, especially after 1941, when relations between the Communists and Nationalists had deteriorated.
Following the end of World War II, the Eighteenth Army Group was incorporated into the new People’s Liberation Army. Units from the former Eighth Route Army were active in the 1948 capture of Manchuria (Northeast Provinces) from the Nationalists, which placed the communist forces in a position to take North China and turn the civil war in their favour.
Some former offices of the Eighth Route Army—such as those in Ürümqi, Xinjiang, and Chonqing, Sichuan—were turned into museums of the revolution in the late 1950s.
