Installment credit, also called Installment Plan, or Hire-purchase Plan,  in business, credit that is granted on condition of its repayment at regular intervals, or installments, over a specified period of time until paid in full. Installment credit is the means by which most durable goods such as automobiles and large home appliances are bought by individuals. Installment credit involves the extension of credit from a seller (and lender) to a purchaser; the purchaser gets physical possession and use of the goods he has bought, but the seller retains legal title to them until every installment has been paid. The purchaser usually is advanced the goods after making an initial fractional payment called a down payment. If the purchaser defaults on his payments at some point, all previous payments are forfeited to the seller, who may also take possession of the goods.
The appeal of installment buying is that it allows prospective purchasers to enjoy the advantages of owning a relatively expensive good while paying for it gradually out of their future income, instead of having to save the necessary purchase price out of their income first. Installment credit can thus greatly expand the purchasing power of ordinary consumers. Installment credit for the purchase of durable consumer goods first appeared in the furniture industry of the United States in the 19th century. But such credit arrangements only acquired great economic importance around the time of World War I, when they were adopted in the United States on a wide scale in the purchase of automobiles. Installment credit now accounts for the majority of purchases of automobiles, expensive home appliances, and furniture, among other consumer goods.
Specialized companies called finance companies service both the retailers and consumers who use installment arrangements. See finance company.
