Consumer confidence,  an economic indicator that measures the degree of optimism that consumers have regarding the overall state of a countryâ€™s economy and their own financial situations. It is a vital source of economic information, as private consumption constitutes about two-thirds of all economic activity in most countries.
During an economic expansion, consumer confidence is usually high. Consumers accordingly tend to spend more than they do at other times, especially for bigger-ticket items and durable goods (e.g., automobiles and household appliances). The increase in consumer spending in turn helps the economy sustain its expansion.
If for some reason consumer confidence declines, consumers become less certain about their financial prospects, and they begin to spend less money; this in turn affects businesses as they begin to experience a decrease in sales. If consumer spending continues to decline and businesses begin to cut back on production, the economy experiences a slowdown and may eventually enter a recession.
The main quantitative measure of consumer confidence in the United States, the Consumer Confidence Index (CCI), is  based on a monthly survey of 5,000 households that is conducted by the Conference Board, an independent research association. The CCI is closely watched by businesses, the Federal Reserve, and investors.
