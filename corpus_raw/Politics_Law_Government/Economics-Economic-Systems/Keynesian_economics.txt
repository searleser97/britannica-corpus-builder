Keynesian economics,  body of ideas set forth by John Maynard Keynes in his General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (1935–36) and other works, intended to provide a theoretical basis for government full-employment policies. It was the dominant school of macroeconomics and represented the prevailing approach to economic policy among most Western governments until the 1970s.
While some economists argue that full employment can be restored if wages are allowed to fall to lower levels, Keynesians maintain that businesses will not employ workers to produce goods that cannot be sold. Because they believe unemployment results from an insufficient demand for goods and services, Keynesianism is considered a “demand-side” theory that focuses on short-run economic fluctuations.
Keynes argued that investment, which responds to variations in the interest rate and to expectations about the future, is the dynamic factor determining the level of economic activity. He also maintained that deliberate government action could foster full employment. Keynesian economists claim that the government can directly influence the demand for goods and services by altering tax policies and public expenditures.
Starting in the 1970s, Keynesian economics was eclipsed in its influence by monetarism, a macroeconomic school that advocated controlled increases in the money supply as a means of mitigating recessions. Following the global financial crisis of 2007–08 and the ensuing Great Recession, interest in ongoing theoretical refinements of Keynesian economics (so-called “new Keynesianism”) increased, in part because Keynesian-inspired responses to the crisis, where they were adopted, proved reasonably successful.
