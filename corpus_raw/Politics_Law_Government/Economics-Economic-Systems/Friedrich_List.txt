Friedrich List, in full Georg Friedrich List,  (born August 6, 1789, Reutlingen, Württemberg, Germany—died Nov. 30, 1846, Kufstein, Austria), German-U.S. economist who believed tariffs on imported goods would stimulate domestic development. List also supported the free exchange of domestic goods, and he gained prominence as founder and secretary of an association of middle and southern German industrialists who sought to abolish tariff barriers within the German states.
Largely self-educated, List advocated reforms in Germany’s civil service and promoted increased publicity of judicial procedures—actions that prompted his exile in 1825. He relocated to the United States to become editor of a German-language newspaper in Reading, Pennsylvania. In 1827 he published Outlines of American Political Economy, in which he argued that a national economy in an early stage of industrialization requires tariff protection. The costs of a tariff, he maintained, should be regarded as an investment in a nation’s future productivity.
After becoming an American citizen, List returned to Germany in 1834 to serve as U.S. consul at Leipzig. While there, he involved himself in the building of a rail line between Leipzig and Dresden in 1837. Despite its success, the undertaking fell short of List’s financial and personal expectations, and he went to France in despair. There he wrote his most remembered book, The National System of Political Economy (1841). List was perennially plagued with financial difficulties, which, coupled with other problems, drove him to suicide.
