Ron Carey, in full Ronald Robert Carey,  (born March 22, 1936, New York, N.Y., U.S.—died Dec. 11, 2008, Flushing, Queens, N.Y.), American labour leader and general president, from 1991 to 1997, of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT), the first Teamsters president elected by direct vote of rank-and-file members.
Carey, the son of a Teamster, joined the union in 1956 as a United Parcel Services (UPS) truck driver in Queens, New York, and was elected president of Teamsters Local 804 in 1967. He often spoke out against the IBT, claiming the union was a locus for mobsters and was run as an autocracy. In 1991, however, Carey was elected general president of the Teamsters. Buoyed by a reform movement within the union, he began cleaning house, reducing his own salary and firing officials with ties to organized crime. He won a second term as Teamsters president in 1996, beating James P. Hoffa by about 16,000 votes.
Carey’s greatest triumph was the August 1997 UPS strike, which won substantial concessions from management and represented the high-water mark for organized labour in the 1990s. Carey’s success was short-lived, though. Only three days after the UPS strike was settled, his reelection victory over Hoffa was voided when an election overseer claimed that the Carey campaign had illegally financed last-minute electioneering by diverting more than $200,000 in Teamsters funds. Carey was dismissed from the union and barred from running for reelection. His testimony in response to those charges led to a perjury indictment in January 2001 by a federal grand jury, but, in another twist, a New York jury found him innocent of perjury in October 2001.
