Seigniorage,   the charge over and above the expenses of coinage (making into coins) that is deducted from the bullion brought to a mint to be coined. From early times, coinage was the prerogative of kings, who prescribed the total charge and the part they were to receive as seigniorage. The deduction was sometimes supplemented by replacing part of the bullion with base metal, resulting in debased coinage. Because the seigniorage and coinage charges were collected by withholding part of the bullion brought for coinage, the currency value of the coins received in exchange was often less than the bullionâ€™s market value. Eventually, merchants stopped providing bullion for the mint, and the supply of coins became inadequate. In England all charges for coinage were abolished in 1666.
Because coins are now issued only as token money for domestic purposes, they no longer need possess a high intrinsic value, and low-standard silver or certain base-metal alloys provide all the qualities required. A substantial margin usually exists between the cost of producing a coin and its statutory currency value; this margin, or profit, is known as seigniorage.
