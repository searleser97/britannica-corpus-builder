Jacob Viner,  (born May 3, 1892, Montreal—died  Sept. 12, 1970, Princeton, N.J., U.S.), Canadian-born American economist who made major contributions to the theory of cost and production, international economics, and the history of economics.
Viner graduated from McGill University (1914) and then immigrated to the United States, obtaining his Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1922. He was a professor at the University of Chicago (1925–46)—with which his name is particularly associated—and Princeton University (1946–60), where he was emeritus after 1960. Early in his career he became associated with the economist Frank Taussig, who greatly influenced Viner’s theories on international trade.
These theories are embodied in three works in particular: Canada’s Balance of International Indebtedness (1924), a study of balance of payments adjustment; Studies in the Theory of International Trade (1937), a major work in the history of economic thought; and The Customs Union Issue (1950), containing the now-familiar trade-creation/trade-diversion distinction. These works are regarded as classics in their field. Viner’s work on international trade covered the entire field from pure theory to policy. He was one of the greatest writers in economic history, combining erudition and critical acuteness to an extraordinary degree. But he was a highly competent theorist over a much wider field than international economics, and in The Long View and the Short (1931) he made what many regard as a fundamental contribution to the theory of costs by clarifying the relationship between long- and short-run costs. This work presented his now-famous envelope cost curve.
