Abe Isoo,  (born March 1, 1865, Fukuoka, Japan—died  Feb. 10, 1949, Tokyo), one of the founders of the Japanese socialist movement and titular head of the Social Mass Party (Shakai Taishūtō) from its inception in 1932 until 1940. He is also remembered for introducing the game of baseball to Japan.
Abe was attracted to socialism while studying for the ministry in the United States, where he graduated from the Hartford (Conn.) Theological Seminary. He returned to Japan in 1899 and two years later became a professor at Tokyo Semmon Gakkō (later Waseda University), a position he held for 25 years. He helped the embryonic Japanese labour movement and played a part in the founding of the Social Democratic Party (1899), which was suppressed almost immediately by the government. A pacifist, Abe opposed the Russo-Japanese War (1904–05); when the antiwar newspaper Heimin shimbun (“People’s Weekly News”) was banned, Abe started his own magazine, Shinkigen (“A New Era”), as a platform to promote parliamentary socialism rooted in Christian humanism.
After the war Abe objected to the takeover of the socialist movement by radical anarcho-syndicalist groups and to their terrorist activities; he retired from politics and devoted himself to educational causes.
After World War I Abe again became active in socialist activities; he established the Fabian Society of Japan (1921), and five years later he resigned from the university to become secretary-general of the new People’s Socialist Party. In 1928 he was elected to the first of his five terms in the lower house of the Japanese Diet. When his party reorganized in 1932 as the much more popular Social Mass Party, he became chairman of its executive committee. He resigned in 1940, however, over the issue of cooperation with the government’s militaristic policies; the government dissolved the party soon after. After World War II, Abe became an adviser to the Socialist Party.
