Leonid Vitalyevich Kantorovich,  (born January 19 [January 6, Old Style], 1912, St. Petersburg, Russia—died April 7, 1986, U.S.S.R.), Soviet mathematician and economist who shared the 1975 Nobel Prize for Economics with Tjalling Koopmans for their work on the optimal allocation of scarce resources.
Kantorovich was educated at Leningrad State University and received his doctorate in mathematics (1930) at the age of 18. He became a professor at Leningrad in 1934, a position he held until 1960. He headed the department of mathematics and economics in the Siberian branch of the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences from 1961 to 1971 and then served as head of the research laboratory at Moscow’s Institute of National Economic Planning (1971–76). Kantorovich was elected to the prestigious Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union (1964) and was awarded the Lenin Prize in 1965.
His first major contribution to economics came in 1938 as a consultant to the Soviet government’s Laboratory of the Plywood Trust. Kantorovich realized that the problem of maximizing the distribution of raw materials could be solved in mathematical terms. The linear technique he developed is now called “linear programming.”
Kantorovich was a notable “reform” economist whose nondogmatic critical analyses of Soviet economic policy clashed with the views of his orthodox Marxist colleagues. In a 1939 book, The Mathematical Method of Production Planning and Organization, he showed that all problems of economic allocation can be reduced to maximizing a function subject to constraints. At the same time, economists John Hicks (in the United Kingdom) and Paul Samuelson (in the United States) were reaching the same conclusion. In his best-known book, The Best Use of Economic Resources (1959), Kantorovich demonstrated that even socialist economies must use prices, based on resource scarcity, to allocate resources efficiently.
