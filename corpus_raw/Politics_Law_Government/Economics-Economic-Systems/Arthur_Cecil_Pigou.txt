Arthur Cecil Pigou,  (born November 18, 1877, Ryde, Isle of Wight, England—died March 7, 1959, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire), British economist noted for his studies in welfare economics.
Educated at King’s College, Cambridge, Pigou was considered one of Alfred Marshall’s best students. When Marshall retired as a professor of political economy in 1908, Pigou was named as Marshall’s replacement. Pigou was responsible for disseminating many of Marshall’s ideas and thereby provided the leading theoretical basis for what came to be known as the Cambridge school of economics.
Pigou’s most influential work was The Economics of Welfare (1920). In it, Pigou developed Marshall’s concept of externalties, which are the costs imposed or benefits conferred on others that are not accounted for by the person who creates these costs or benefits. Pigou argued that negative externalities (costs imposed) should be offset by a tax, while positive externalities should be offset by a subsidy. In the early 1960s Pigou’s analysis was criticized by Ronald Coase, who argued that taxes and subsidies are not necessary if the partners in the transaction—that is, the people affected by the externality and the people who cause it—can bargain over the transaction.
Pigou applied his economic analysis to a number of other problems, including tariff policy, unemployment, and public finance. He also served on the Royal Commission on Income Tax (1919–20) and on two committees on the currency (1918–19; 1924–25).
