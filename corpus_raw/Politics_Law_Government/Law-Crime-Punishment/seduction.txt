Seduction,  in law, the act of a man enticing (without the use of physical force) a previously chaste woman to consent to sexual intercourse. In broader usage, the term refers to any act of persuasion, between heterosexual or homosexual individuals, and excluding the issue of chastity, that leads to sexual intercourse.
Seduction has not as a rule been a criminal offense in most Western countries, but in the United States statutes in most states imposed criminal liability upon the seducing male. The elements of the crime varied, consisting of one or more of the following: intercourse with a female by trickery or under a promise of marriage; a requirement that the female be previously chaste; a requirement that the female be under a certain age, ranging from 18 to 25; and a requirement that the defendant be over a certain age. A seduction prosecution was barred in most states by marriage with the seducer and in others by an offer of marriage. Several states refused to allow a conviction for seduction without corroboration of the testimony of the seduced female. See also rape.
