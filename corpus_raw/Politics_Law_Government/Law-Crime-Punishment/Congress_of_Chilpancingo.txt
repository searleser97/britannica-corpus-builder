Congress of Chilpancingo,  (September–November 1813), meeting held at Chilpancingo, in present Guerrero state, Mex., that declared the independence of Mexico from Spain and drafted a constitution, which received final approval (Oct. 22, 1814) at the Congress of Apatzingán. José María Morelos y Pavón, who called the congress at Chilpancingo, had assumed leadership of the Mexican independence movement after the execution of its initiator, Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, in July 1811. A liberal document by 19th-century standards, the constitution provided for, among other things, a republican form of government and the abolition of slavery and all caste systems. Before the new government could take effect, however, the royalist forces crushed the revolutionaries; Morelos was tried and shot on Dec. 22, 1815. Five years later, independence was achieved, but social inequities and monarchy (the latter only until 1823) were preserved by the so-called Plan of Iguala, the blueprint for the new government issued by Agustín de Iturbide in 1821.
