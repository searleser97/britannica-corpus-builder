Summary jurisdiction,  in Anglo-American law, jurisdiction of a magistrate or judge to conduct proceedings resulting in a conviction or order without trial by jury. Summary jurisdiction is almost entirely a creation of statute. In the United States, despite federal and state constitutional provisions guaranteeing trial by jury, it is generally held that certain petty offenses (e.g., disturbing the peace) may be tried summarily. The trial of such cases is usually more informal and expeditious than those for more serious offenses. Civil suits in which the amounts are small may also be tried without a jury.
In England crimes are classified as either summary offenses, which are tried by magistratesâ€™ courts, or indictable offenses, for which there is a right to a jury trial. There also are offenses that may in some cases be treated in either way. Since the mid-20th century, most petty offenses punishable by imprisonment for more than three months may be tried on indictment. The English law also includes some civil proceedings within the summary jurisdiction of magistrates.
