Parsonâ€™s Cause,   dispute involving Anglican clergy in colonial Virginia, arising (1755, 1758) when laws commuted clerical salaries, previously paid in tobacco, to currency at the rate of twopence a pound when tobacco was selling at sixpence a pound. A royal veto (1759) encouraged the clergy to sue for back pay. In the most publicized case (1763), Patrick Henry defended a Hanover County parish against a suit by the Rev. James Maury, assailing the crown interference and inducing the jury to return only one penny damages for the plaintiff. After a general twopenny act (1769) that reflected going rates, the clergy gave up their protest.
