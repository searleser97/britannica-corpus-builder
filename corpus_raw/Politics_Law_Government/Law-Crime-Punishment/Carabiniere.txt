Carabiniere, plural Carabinieri, member of the Arma dei Carabinieri (Italian: “Army of Carabinieri”), byname Arma Benemerita (“Meritorious Army”),  one of the national police forces of Italy. Originally an elite military organization in the Savoyard states, the corps became part of the Italian armed forces at the time of national unification (1861). For almost 140 years the Carabinieri were considered part of the army, but in 2000 the corps became an independent branch of the Italian armed forces. Members of the corps wear a variety of uniforms, from military-style fatigues to an ensemble that resembles that of the civilian police force to full Napoleonic regalia. Virtually all of these uniforms include a white bandolier, the presence of which indicates that an officer is on duty. Carabinieri are housed in barracks, and the corps has a variety of military duties: it polices the armed forces, guards military installations, enforces recruiting laws, and has specific military responsibilities in the event of war. In these capacities it is responsible to the minister of defense.
The corps also acts as a civil police force, with responsibility for protecting public order and detecting crime. In those areas its function overlaps that of the Polizia de Stato (State Police), and, like the guards, it is responsible to the minister of the interior.
