University of Bologna, Italian Università di Bologna,  the oldest university in Europe and one of the oldest and most famous universities in the world, founded in the Italian city of Bologna in the 11th century. It became in the 12th and 13th centuries the principal centre for studies in canon and civil law and attracted students from all over Europe. Because it then had no fixed site or student housing, scholars of like nationality formed free associations, or guilds, to secure protections that they could not claim as citizens (see nation). The organizations formed at Bologna became models for modern universities. In 1158 Emperor Frederick I granted privileges to scholars of Bologna that were eventually extended to all Italian universities.
The students at Bologna were mostly mature men; as the civil law and canon law were at first the only branches of study, they attracted men already filling office in some department of the church or state—archdeacons, heads of schools, canons of cathedrals, and like functionaries. About the year 1200 the faculties of medicine and philosophy (or liberal arts) were formed. The medical faculty became famous in the 13th century for reviving the practice of human dissection, which had not been used in Europe since Roman times. The faculty of science was developed in the 17th century, and in the 18th century women were admitted as students and teachers.
After a period of decline, Bologna was reorganized in 1860 and resumed its place among Italy’s foremost universities. The contemporary university includes faculties of jurisprudence, political science, letters and philosophy, medicine, and engineering.
