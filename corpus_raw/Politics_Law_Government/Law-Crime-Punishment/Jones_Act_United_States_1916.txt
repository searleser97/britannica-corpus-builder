Jones Act, formally Philippine Autonomy Act of 1916,  statute announcing the intention of the United States government to “withdraw their sovereignty over the Philippine Islands as soon as a stable government can be established therein.” The U.S. had acquired the Philippines in 1898 as a result of the Spanish–American War; and from 1901 legislative power in the islands had been exercised through a Philippine Commission effectively dominated by Americans. One of the most significant sections of the Jones Act replaced the Commission with an elective Senate and, with minimum property qualifications, extended the franchise to all literate Filipino males. The law also incorporated a bill of rights.
American sovereignty was retained by provisions of the act reserving to the governor general power to veto any measure passed by the new Philippine legislature. The liberal governor general Francis B. Harrison rarely used this power and moved rapidly to appoint Filipinos in place of Americans in the civil service. By the end of Harrison’s term in 1921, Filipinos had taken charge of the internal affairs of the islands.
The Jones Act remained in force as a de facto constitution for the Philippines until it was superseded by the Tydings–McDuffie Act of 1934. Its promise of eventual absolute independence set the course for future American policy in the islands.
