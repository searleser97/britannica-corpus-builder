Larrikin,  Australian slang term of unknown origin popularized in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It signifies a young hoodlum or hooligan in the impoverished subculture of urban Australia. The term was applied to the large numbers of sporadically employed teenagers and young adults who banded together in gangs, or “pushes,” glorified the outlaw bushrangers, engaged in gang fights with each other, assaulted citizens (especially in Sydney and Melbourne), and generally defied and ridiculed the authorities. Larrikinism declined after 1900 particularly in the face of intensified police surveillance; the stabilization of Australia’s urban society and the development of organized sporting activities have also been credited with contributing to its demise. The term larrikin is still used in Australia to characterize youthful rowdyism.
