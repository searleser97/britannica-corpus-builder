Charter to the Gentry, also called Charter to the Nobility, formally Charter for the Rights, Freedoms, and Privileges of the Noble Russian Gentry, Russian Zhalovannaya Gramota Dvoryanstvu (“Given Charter for the Gentry”), or Gramota Na Prava, Volnosty, y Preimushchestva Blagorodnogo Rossiyskogo Dvoryanstva,  (1785) edict issued by the Russian empress Catherine II the Great that recognized the corps of nobles in each province as a legal corporate body and stated the rights and privileges bestowed upon its members. The charter accorded to the gentry of each province and county in Russia (excluding those of northern European Russia and Siberia) the right to meet every three years in a general assembly that could discuss and take action on the nobles’ local affairs, elect a marshal of the nobility, and directly petition the autocrat on matters of importance to the gentry.
The charter also confirmed the nobles’ exemption from compulsory service to the state and from payment of taxes. It granted them the rights of free speech and assembly, as well as the right to a trial by their peers. Members of the gentry exclusively were allowed to own estates populated by serfs; estates owned by nobles were made hereditary property, and the power to revoke title to an estate (as well as to revoke a nobleman’s rank) was entrusted to the courts. The charter gave the gentry extensive power over its serfs; the nobles gained judicial authority over all crimes committed by serfs except robbery and murder and were empowered to sentence a serf to penal servitude in Siberia and also to recall him.
The charter, however, by accentuating distinctions among certain elements of the nobility, actually fostered enmity between the old aristocracy (descendants of princes and boyars) and the new gentry (which acquired its status as reward for service to the state). Nonetheless, by its recognition of the nobility as an elite class, the charter ensured that the gentry would support and maintain the autocratic form of government in Russia.
