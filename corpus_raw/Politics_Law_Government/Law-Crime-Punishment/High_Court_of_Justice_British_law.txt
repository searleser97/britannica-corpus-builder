High Court of Justice,  in England and Wales, court system centred in London and comprising three divisions of both original and appellate jurisdiction, mostly in civil matters and only occasionally in criminal cases. The divisions are the Chancery Division, presided over by the chancellor of the High Court in the capacity of president of the Chancery Division and hearing cases involving business and property disputes, intellectual-property claims, estates, etc.; the Queen’s (or King’s) Bench Division, presided over by a president and hearing cases involving contract, tort, and libel and slander; and the Family Division, headed by a president and dealing with marriage, adoption, wardship, and other family-related matters.
All High Court judges may sit in any division, administering both law and equity, although they are now usually assigned to specific work and divisions. There are four sittings: Michaelmas (from October 1 to December 21), Hilary (from January 11 to the Wednesday before Easter), Easter (from the second Tuesday after Easter to Friday before the spring Bank Holiday, the last Monday in May), and Trinity (from the second Tuesday after the spring holiday to July 31).
The High Court is the second part of the Senior Courts of England and Wales, ranking immediately below the Court of Appeal and above the Crown Court.
