Affair of the Poisons,  one of the most sensational criminal cases of 17th-century France. In 1679 an inquiry revealed that nobles, prosperous bourgeois, and the common people alike had been resorting secretly to female fortune-tellers—at that time numerous in Paris—for drugs and poisons, for black masses, and for other criminal purposes.
Nicolas de La Reynie, whose diligent investigation took three years, headed the inquiry. A special tribunal for the trial of the accused, known as the chambre ardente, was created in April 1679. It held 210 sessions at the Arsenal in Paris, issued 319 writs of arrest, and sentenced 36 persons to death, including the poisoner La Voisin (Catherine Deshayes, Madame Monvoisin), who was burned on Feb. 22, 1680.
Among the many members of French society who were implicated was Madame de Montespan, the mistress of King Louis XIV. She was accused by Voisin’s daughter and her accomplices of being a customer of La Voisin from 1667; of resorting to magic and philtres to win the King’s love; of participating in black masses; and of attempting to poison her young rival, Mlle de Fontanges, and the King.
Louis suspended the public proceedings after the accusations against Madame de Montespan but ordered the continuation of the inquiry. Thus, most of the chief offenders, who had managed by their accusations to transform a criminal trial into an affair of state, escaped execution and ended their lives in various provincial prisons. The charges concerning black masses and attempted poisonings were never proved against Madame de Montespan.
