Reversion,   in Anglo-American law, interest held by a prior owner in property given to another, which, upon the happening of some future event, will return to that prior owner. A reversion is itself specific property, and it can be sold or disposed of as property by the reversion owner. One who holds property subject to a reversion interest held by another is under certain obligations as to the use of that property. Generally, such an owner must reasonably protect the property from spoilage or diminution in value, for the sake of the future owner.
In present usage there are two general methods of creating a reversion. One retains a reversion when he gives his property to another for that personâ€™s use during his life only, and at his death the property reverts to the prior owner; or one may give his property to another to possess and use as his own only until the operation of a certain condition. The majority of U.S. states limit this conditional reversion to a specified length of a time, usually not longer than 50 years.
