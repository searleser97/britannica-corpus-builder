Annulment,   legal invalidation of a marriage. Annulment announces the invalidity of a marriage that was void from its inception. It is to be distinguished from dissolution, which ends a valid marriage for special reasons—e.g., insanity of one partner after marrying. The annulment decree attempts to leave the parties in statu quo ante (as they were before the marriage), unless doing so would adversely affect a third person.
In secular law, only the government, through its courts, can invalidate a marriage; and generally only a party to the marriage can seek annulment. Christian canon law also has procedures for invalidating marriages.
To justify annulment, there must be a defect in the marriage contract—e.g., incompetence of one party because of age, insanity, or a pre-existing marriage. Continued absence of one party also justifies annulment. Thus, in some places, one party may get an annulment if the other is sentenced to a long prison term. Generally, annulment is easier if the marriage is unconsummated.
In annulment lawsuits, the validity of the marriage must be clearly disproved. The so-called clean hands doctrine figures heavily in such cases, meaning that the conduct of the person seeking the annulment must be fair and above suspicion if he is to prevail. Thus, a party who knew the partner was underage but proceeded with the marriage would probably be denied annulment.
