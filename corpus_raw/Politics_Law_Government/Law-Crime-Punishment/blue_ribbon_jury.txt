Blue-ribbon jury, also called special jury or struck jury,  a group, chosen from the citizenry of a district, that has special qualifications to try a complex or important case. The blue-ribbon jury is intended to overcome the problems of ordinary juries in interpreting complex technical or commercial questions. In the United States blue-ribbon juries were provided for by statutes, the terms varying by jurisdiction. In deference to the principle of equality, the use of blue-ribbon juries is now obsolete in the United States.
The selection of blue-ribbon juries was similar to an ordinary trial jury, but the lists of potential jurors contained only specially qualified persons. Although the origin of the blue-ribbon jury is uncertain, it was clearly in use under William III of England (reigned 1689â€“1702). Complexity was not the only reason for the blue-ribbon jury. When the sheriff (who impaneled juries) was suspected of bias, this special jury was invoked as a safeguard. By placing important persons on the jury, the court prevented intimidation.
The more common solutions to the increasing complexity of litigation have been greater use of expert witnesses and the assignment of certain cases to quasi-judicial administrative agencies.
