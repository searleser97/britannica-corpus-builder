Provost, French Prévôt,  in French law, an inferior royal judge under the ancien régime, who, during the later Middle Ages, often served as an administrator of the domain. The position appears to date from the 11th century, when the Capetian dynasty of kings sought a means to render justice within their realm and to subject their vassals to royal control.
The provosts performed a variety of functions: they collected taxes and fines for the king, served as military commanders for the district, and sat as lower-court judges. For a long time they were the only local judges representing the Capetians; they held their offices as fiefs and collected their revenues and fees as tax farmers. Consequently, they were able to achieve considerable independence of the crown, and abuses followed. By the 13th century they were brought under the control of the bailiffs, and after 1493 the provosts were paid by the crown as salaried officials. Their powers were further limited in the 17th century, when the provosts lost all except their judicial powers. In the south of France the provosts were known as viguiers.
