Infanticide,   the killing of the newborn. It has often been interpreted as a primitive method of birth control and a means of ridding a group of its weak and deformed children; but most societies actively desire children and put them to death (or allow them to die) only under exceptional circumstances. Among the Eskimo, for example, conditions of life were so severe that it was sometimes the practice to kill female children shortly after birth, lest there not be husbands able to support them. In Polynesia, where populations often reached high density, similar practices prevailed. Children also have been allowed to die or have been killed with cultural sanction because of irregular mating (such as incest or conception out of wedlock), or abnormal births, or for similar reasons. In many advanced societies, children have been killed in the belief that it would ensure health, good fortune, and general fertility. Religious offerings, especially of the firstborn, are known from the Bible, as well as from the histories of Egypt, Greece, and Rome. Firstborn sacrifice was once common among many peoples in India; here the motive was the offering of oneâ€™s most precious possession to the deities. In modern societies the regulation of population with contraceptives or through abortion has tended to greatly reduce the frequency of infanticide.
