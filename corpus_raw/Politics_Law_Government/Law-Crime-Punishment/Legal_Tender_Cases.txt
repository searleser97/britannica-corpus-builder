Legal Tender Cases,  two legal cases—Knox v. Lee and Parker v. Davis—decided by the U.S. Supreme Court on May 1, 1871, regarding the power of Congress to authorize government notes not backed by specie (coin) as money that creditors had to accept in payment of debts.
To finance the American Civil War, the federal government in 1862 passed the Legal Tender Act, authorizing the creation of paper money not redeemable in gold or silver. About $430 million worth of “greenbacks” were put in circulation, and this money by law had to be accepted for all taxes, debts, and other obligations—even those contracted prior to the passage of the act.
In Hepburn v. Griswold (February 7, 1870), the Court ruled by a four-to-three majority that Congress lacked the power to make the notes legal tender. Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase, despite his involvement in passage of the Legal Tender Act as secretary of the Treasury during the Civil War, wrote the majority opinion, declaring that the congressional authorization of greenbacks as legal tender violated Fifth Amendment guarantees against deprivation of property without due process of law.
On the day the decision was announced, a disapproving Pres. Ulysses S. Grant sent the nominations of two new justices to the Senate for confirmation. Justices Joseph P. Bradley and William Strong were confirmed, and at its next session the Court agreed to reconsider the greenback issue. In Knox v. Lee and Parker v. Davis, the Court reversed its Hepburn v. Griswold decision by a five-to-four majority, asserting that the Legal Tender Act represented a justifiable use of federal power at a time of national emergency.
