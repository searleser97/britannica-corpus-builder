Hare–Hawes–Cutting Act,   (1933), the first law setting a specific date for Philippine independence from the United States. It was passed by Congress as a result of pressure from two sources: American farmers, who, during the Great Depression, feared competition from Filipino sugar and coconut oils; and Filipino leaders, who were eager to run their own government.
The bill was passed by the Senate in December 1932 but was vetoed by Pres. Herbert Hoover. To Hoover’s surprise, Congress promptly overrode his veto, and the bill became law on Jan. 17, 1933. The act, however, required approval by the Philippine Senate, and this was not forthcoming. Filipino political leader Manuel Quezon led a campaign against the bill because of provisions in it that allowed the indefinite retention of U.S. military bases in the islands. The Tydings–McDuffie Act, substantially similar to the rejected measure but incorporating minor changes, was accepted by the Philippine Senate in 1934.
