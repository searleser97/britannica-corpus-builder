G.I. Bill, in full G.I. Bill of Rights, also called Servicemenâ€™s Readjustment Act,  U.S. legislation adopted in 1944 that provided various benefits to veterans of  World War II. Through the Veterans Administration (later the Department of Veterans Affairs; VA), the act enabled veterans to obtain grants for school and college tuition, low-interest mortgage and small-business loans, job training, hiring privileges, and unemployment benefits. Amendments to the act provided for full disability coverage and the construction of additional VA hospitals. Later legislation extended the benefits to all who had served in the armed forces.
