Principal in the second degree,  person who assists another in the commission of a crime and is present when the crime is being committed but does not actually participate in the crime. For example, an individual standing guard at the door during the armed robbery of a service station would be considered a principal in the second degree. The courts typically treat a principal in the second degree just as they treat the perpetrator, handing down the same sentence.
