Garnishment,   (from Middle French garnir, meaning “to warn”), a process by which a creditor can obtain satisfaction of an indebtedness of the debtor by initiating a proceeding to attach property or other assets. A common form of garnishment involves a creditor attaching the wages of an employee owed to him by his employer. The creditor instituting the proceedings is the garnisher, the person indebted is the debtor-employee, and the party holding the property (the employer) is the garnishee. The result of a garnishment of salary proceeding, if successful, is an order of the court requiring the employer to deduct and pay to the creditor a percentage of the debtor’s salary until the debt is satisfied.
The remedies of garnishment and attachment are traceable to Roman law and were a recognized practice of medieval merchants. The availability and scope of the remedy today depends on statutory authorization; statutory provisions differ among the various countries having garnishment statutes.
