Peine forte et dure, (French: “strong and hard punishment”)  in English law, punishment that was inflicted upon those who were accused of a felony and stood silent, refusing to plead either guilty or not guilty, or upon those who challenged more than 20 prospective jurors. For example, English law permitted defendants the right to challenge jurors who might be prejudiced, but the courts did not want to give defendants the right to abuse this rule by allowing them to hand-pick friendly juries. By the Statute of Westminster in 1275, the peine usually consisted of imprisonment and starvation until submission, but pressing to death by heavy weights was added in 1406. Because an individual who submitted a plea and was convicted forfeited his goods to the crown, some individuals chose to stand mute under the threat of peine forte et dure to ensure that their goods and estates would be inherited by their families. In treason cases peine forte et dure was inapplicable, because standing mute in such cases meant a plea of guilty.
One of the few instances of the use of peine forte et dure in the American colonies took place during the Salem witch trials of 1692. One of the accused, 80-year-old Giles Corey, decided not to stand trial rather than forfeit his family’s goods. He was ordered to undergo peine forte et dure and was pressed to death by interrogators using stone weights. Cases such as these later helped to prompt the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.
England abolished the peine forte et dure in 1772, when “standing mute” was made equivalent to conviction. By an act of 1827 a plea of “not guilty” was to be entered against any prisoner refusing to plead, a rule that was adopted in many legal systems.
