Brief,  in law, a document often in the form of a summary or abstract. The term is used primarily in common-law countries, and its exact meaning varies across jurisdictions.
In the United States a brief is a written legal argument that is presented to a court to aid it in reaching a conclusion on the legal issues involved in the case. It is invariably employed in appellate courts and is of the utmost importance when no oral argument is made. A brief frequently is used in trials when complex legal issues are involved. The usual procedure requires that the party seeking the judicial remedy present its written argument to the court and send a copy to the opponent. The opponent then files and serves an answering brief. Usually, the first counsel will have an opportunity to file a reply brief. On unusual occasions the brief may include extensive economic and sociological data. Such a brief became known as a “Brandeis brief,” after the United States Supreme Court justice Louis Brandeis, who made effective use of it. When a court permits an outsider to file a brief in a case to which the outsider is not a party, it is generally referred to as an amicus curiae (“friend of the court”) brief.
In England a brief is a document of instructions prepared by a solicitor for a barrister to follow in court. Only the barrister may appear before the high court but can act on behalf of a litigant only pursuant to instructions from a solicitor. In the brief the solicitor will report on the evidence and proof available and include statements and interviews of witnesses or summaries thereof.
