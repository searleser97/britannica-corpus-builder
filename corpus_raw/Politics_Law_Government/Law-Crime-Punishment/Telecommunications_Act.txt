Telecommunications Act of 1996,  U.S. legislation that attempted to bring more competition to the telephone market for both local and long distance service. It was passed by Congress in January 1996 and signed into law by Pres. Bill Clinton in February 1996. It permitted firms that served competitive local markets to enter the long distance market, and it attempted to implement a single layer of regulation at the federal level.
The deregulation that was brought about by this act enabled competition within the local exchange areas that had been effectively monopolies for many years. It also provided new regulations such as forcing the local carriers to share their communications facilities with competitors at rates established under the actâ€™s guidelines and ensuring that each competitor was treated in a fair and equitable manner.
Additional provisions of the act removed restrictions on media ownership and resulted in immediate consolidation within that segment of the industry. Yet another provision provided guidelines for Internet indecency and prohibited sending indecent or obscene communications to minors via the Internet (see Communications Decency Act). The Supreme Court, however, later ruled that the provision was unconstitutional under the First Amendment. Another significant provision protected Internet service providers from liability for content of third parties on their service.
