Edict of Toleration, German Toleranzpatent,  (Oct. 19, 1781), law promulgated by the Holy Roman emperor Joseph II granting limited freedom of worship to non-Roman Catholic Christians and removing civil disabilities to which they had been previously subject in the Austrian domains, while maintaining a privileged position for the Catholic Church. In an edict of Jan. 2, 1782, sometimes also called the Toleranzpatent, Joseph regulated the status of Jews in the Habsburg territories, freeing them from many discriminatory restrictions.
