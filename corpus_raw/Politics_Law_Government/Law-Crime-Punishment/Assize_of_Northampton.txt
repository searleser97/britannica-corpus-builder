Assize of Northampton,  (1176), group of ordinances agreed upon by King Henry II of England and the magnates in council at Northampton. The ordinances were issued as instructions to six committees of three judges each, who were to visit the six circuits into which England was divided for the purpose. The first part of the assize repeated the substance of some provisions of the Assize of Clarendon (1166), but with several differences. The second part of the assize defined some of the rights of the heir, the lord (or lords), and the widow of a deceased free tenant; its protection of the heir’s right to succeed to land established the possessory action known as mort d’ancestor (i.e., an action to recover lawfully inherited land that had been taken by another before the heir was able to take possession). In line with this, the justices were also ordered to hear pleas of novel disseisin (an action to recover lands of which the plaintiff had been dispossessed) arising since May 1175 and to try proprietary actions commenced by the king’s writ for the recovery of land held by the service of half a knight’s fee or less.
The rest of the assize’s text contains other instructions to the judges concerning their various administrative, political, judicial, and financial duties.
