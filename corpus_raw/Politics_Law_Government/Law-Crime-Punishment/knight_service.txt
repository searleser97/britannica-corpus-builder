Knight service,   in the European feudal system, military duties performed in return for tenures of land. The military service might be required for wars or expeditions or merely for riding and escorting services or guarding the castle. To obtain such service, a lord could either enfeoff (grant a fief to) one man for direct and personal service or enfeoff someone who would bring with him other knights. The number of knights supplied usually bore some relation to the size of the fief.
Originally services and equipment were supplied at the vassalâ€™s expense. The normal period of service was 40 days a year. In England knight service was held due to the king only. In France, however, the lesser nobility as well could claim such service and thus were able to achieve great personal power.
As time went on, variations developed. From the mid-12th century fewer knights were being summoned, but they often were serving for longer than 40 days; sometimes service due was rendered in scutage, a tax paid in lieu of service. By 1300 the decline in the importance of cavalry, the increasing use of mercenaries, and the resistance of tenants had combined to reduce substantially the number of knights summoned from any fief.
