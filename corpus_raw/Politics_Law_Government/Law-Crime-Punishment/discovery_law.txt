Discovery,  in law, pretrial procedures providing for the exchange of information between the parties involved in the proceedings. Discovery may be made through interrogatories, which consist of written questions sent from one side to the other in an attempt to secure important facts; it also can be made through depositions, whereby a witness is sworn and, in the presence of attorneys for both sides, is subjected to questions. The written record of the proceedings also is called a deposition and may be introduced later if the case comes to trial. Other forms of discovery include the demand for production and inspection (by which the opposing party may be required to produce relevant documents or other evidence) and requests for medical examination (for cases in which a partyâ€™s mental or physical condition is at issue). Extensive discovery is permitted under U.S. civil procedure but is much more restricted in other countries with common-law systems and in civil-law systems.
