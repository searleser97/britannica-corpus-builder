Interlocutory decree,   generally, a judicial decision that is not final or that deals with a point other than the principal subject matter of the controversy at hand. An interlocutory decree of divorce in the United States or a decree nisi in England, for example, is a judicial decree pronouncing the divorce of the parties provisionally but not terminating the marriage until the expiration of a certain period. The purpose of requiring such a period of time is to discourage quick and easy divorce, to encourage reconciliation, and to enable the court to supervise the arrangements to be made for the children of the marriage. In England the time is also used to give the court an opportunity to discover collusive practices by which the parties may have deceived the court.
In England the interlocutory period is six weeks, whereas in the United States, in those states requiring that a decree of divorce be preceded by an interlocutory decree, the period of delay varies from three months to one year. See also judgment.
