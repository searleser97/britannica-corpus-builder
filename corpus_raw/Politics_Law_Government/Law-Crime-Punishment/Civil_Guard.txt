Civil Guard, Spanish Guardia Civil,  national police force of Spain, organized along military lines and engaged primarily in maintaining order in rural areas and in patrolling the frontiers and the highways. Formerly (until 1986) commanded by a lieutenant general of the army, the Civil Guard is now headed by a civilian director-general, and it is jointly responsible to the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defense. It was created in 1844, and its first accomplishment was the suppression of brigandage in southern Spain.
In its service of successive governments the Civil Guard combatted, as forms of sedition, the organization of labour and republicanism and came to be regarded by the peasantry as an instrument of oppression by the state. In northeastern Spain a tradition of resentment persisted into the 1980s in the Basque and Catalan regions, where the Civil Guard opposed advocates of autonomy or separatism.
