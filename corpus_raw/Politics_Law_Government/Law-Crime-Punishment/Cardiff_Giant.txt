Cardiff Giant,  famous hoax perpetrated by George Hall (or Hull) of Binghamton, New York, U.S. A block of gypsum was quarried near Fort Dodge, Iowa, and shipped to Chicago, Illinois. There it was carved (1868) in the shape of a human figure and then buried on a farm near Cardiff, New York. “Discovered” (1869) by well diggers, the statue was alleged to be a 10-foot (3-metre) petrified prehistoric man, until the hoax was exposed by the American paleontologist Othniel C. Marsh.
