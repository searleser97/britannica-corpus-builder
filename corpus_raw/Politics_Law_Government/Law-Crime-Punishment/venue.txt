Venue,  in law, locality in which a criminal offense or civil litigation is to be conducted. The concept of venue involves important issues of public policy in the adjudication of crimes.
Local and general statutes specify the court in which a criminal offense or civil claim must be tried. If the case is brought before an improper official, either the accused in a criminal case, a defendant in a civil case, or the court itself may move for a change of court, or a change of venue.
The grounds for a change of venue are specified in statutes, though there is considerable discretion left to the court. Grounds for a change have included newspaper reporting considered to have biased all potential jurors, the danger of violence, racial prejudice, and the convenience of jurors or witnesses.
In criminal cases the right to request a change of venue generally must be exercised by the accused, but the prosecution also may seek a change. The judge may disqualify himself and request a change to another court in another jurisdiction. A codefendant has the right to request a change even if it requires splitting the trial into two or more separate cases.
Venue statutes usually specify that a trial must occur in the district that has subject-matter jurisdiction over the offense. Often this is the district in which the crime was committed or in which a corpus delicti (Latin: “body of the crime”) was discovered. If a trial is held in an improper court, the defendant cannot later complain if he has failed to request a change. If he makes such a request and it is wrongfully denied, an appeals court can require a new trial.
