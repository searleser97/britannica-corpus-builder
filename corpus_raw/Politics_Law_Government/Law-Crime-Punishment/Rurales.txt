Rurales,  federal corps of rural police established on May 6, 1861, by the Mexican president Benito Juárez to combat the banditry that threatened travel and commerce throughout Mexico. Such a force had been planned four years earlier but could not be established during the War of Reform. In 1869, after the overthrow of the empire of Maximilian, it was reconstituted under the Ministry of the Interior (Ministro de Gobernación) and charged with patrolling the highways and railways, assisting the army, guarding special shipments of goods and bullion, and policing local elections. Under President Porfirio Díaz (governed 1876–1911), its powers were considerably enlarged to include escorting prisoners, guarding public buildings, intimidating political opponents, and acting as a kind of praetorian guard for the dictatorship. It acquired a considerable reputation (rather exaggerated) for oppression and efficiency. By the end of Díaz’ reign, the Rurales numbered about 2,700 men. The Rurales were disbanded in 1914.
In 1926 a new force, the Rural Defense Force (Guardia Rural), was created out of a number of volunteer forces that had developed after 1915 for local self-protection. Though this corps still exists as an army reserve, by the late 20th century it was being phased out, and its forces dropped from more than 100,000 in the early 1970s to fewer than 15,000 by the early 21st century. Volunteers do not receive pay but are subject to call in national emergencies.
