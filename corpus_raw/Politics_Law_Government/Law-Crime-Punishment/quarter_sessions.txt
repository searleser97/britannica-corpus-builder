Quarter sessions,   formerly, in England and Wales, sessions of a court held four times a year by a justice of the peace to hear criminal charges as well as civil and criminal appeals. The term also applied to a court held before a recorder, or judge, in a borough having a quarter sessions separate from that of the county in which the borough was situated. Under the Courts Act of 1971, all of the quarter-sessions courts were abolished, and their work was assumed by a system of courts called the Crown Court.
The history of quarter sessions traces to 1327, when Edward III appointed men in every county to keep the peace. By 1368 these justices of the peace were empowered to hear and determine cases brought to them on criminal matters, and in 1388 they were commanded to sit four times a year in their counties. Prior to their abolition in 1971, quarter-sessions courts came to have jurisdiction to hear and determine most of the indictable cases in England and Wales. They became situated between magistrates’ courts below and assize courts above. When sitting with a jury, a quarter-sessions court had a wide criminal jurisdiction and could also hear civil and criminal cases on appeal from a magistrates’ court.
