Socage,   in feudal English property law, form of land tenure in which the tenant lived on his lord’s land and in return rendered to the lord a certain agricultural service or money rent. At the death of a tenant in socage (or socager), the land went to his heir after a payment to the lord of a sum of money (known as a relief), which in time became fixed at an amount equal to a year’s rent on the land. Socage is to be distinguished from tenure by knight service, in which the service rendered was of a military nature, although, by statute in 1660, all knight-service tenure became socage tenure. In time, most of the land in England came to be held in socage tenure. In the United States, lands in the early colonies were given in socage, particularly in Pennsylvania, where the royal charter given to William Penn created a socage tenure with an annual rent of two beaver skins for the land. After the American Revolution, lands held in socage tenure from the crown were deemed to be held by the state as sovereign, and several states passed statutes or enacted constitutional provisions abolishing tenure.
