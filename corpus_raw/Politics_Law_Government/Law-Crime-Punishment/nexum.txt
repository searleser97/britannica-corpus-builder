Nexum,   in very early Roman law, a type of formal contract involving the loan of money under such oppressive conditions that it might result in the debtorâ€™s complete subjection to the creditor. The transaction was accomplished by means of a ritual employing scales and copper, the traditional symbols of transfer of property. The procedure was discontinued in the late 4th century bc, when the so-called Lex Poetelia released all those who were nexi (i.e., insolvent debtors held in bondage by their creditors).
