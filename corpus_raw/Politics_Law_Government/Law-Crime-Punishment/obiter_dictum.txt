Obiter dictum,  Latin phrase meaning “that which is said in passing,” an incidental statement. Specifically, in law, it refers to a passage in a judicial opinion which is not necessary for the decision of the case before the court. Such statements lack the force of precedent but may nevertheless be significant.
American legal scholar John Chipman Gray stated, “In order that an opinion may have the weight of a precedent…it must be an opinion the formation of which is necessary for the decision of a particular case; in other words, it must not be obiter dictum.” Dicta frequently take the form of statements which are unnecessarily broad. Thus, when a young man willfully murdered his grandfather to prevent his revoking a will, the court held that the beneficiary was not entitled to the legacy which the will provided for him, saying that the law will not permit one “to take advantage of his own wrong or to found any claim upon his own iniquity, or to acquire property by his own crime.” In a subsequent case, involving a legatee who had negligently caused the testator’s death in an automobile accident, the same result would not necessarily follow. The court would be free to distinguish the cases on their facts and limit the broad dictum of the earlier case.
