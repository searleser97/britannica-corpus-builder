Diminished responsibility,   legal doctrine that absolves an accused person of part of the liability for his criminal act if he suffers from such abnormality of mind as to substantially impair his responsibility in committing or being a party to an alleged violation. The doctrine of diminished responsibility provides a mitigating defense in cases in which the mental disease or defect is not of such magnitude as to exclude criminal responsibility altogether.
It is most frequently asserted in connection with murder cases requiring proof of a particular mental state on the part of the accused. If a judge or jury concludes that the accused is incapable of premeditation yet has the capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his behaviour to the requirements of the law, the court can bring a less serious penalty to bear. Generally, the defendant who successfully establishes his abnormal mental condition is found guilty of manslaughter instead of murder.
Few jurisdictions subscribe to the doctrine of diminished responsibility. Although long a part of Scottish homicide law, England and Wales did not adopt the defense until 1957. Most other countries recognize only mental disease or defect of sufficient degree to sustain a defense of insanity. See also insanity.
