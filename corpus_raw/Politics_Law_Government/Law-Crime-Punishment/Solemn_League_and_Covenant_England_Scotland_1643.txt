Solemn League and Covenant,   (1643), agreement between the English and Scots by which the Scots agreed to support the English Parliamentarians in their disputes with the royalists and both countries pledged to work for a civil and religious union of England, Scotland, and Ireland under a presbyterian–parliamentary system; it was accepted by the Church of Scotland (Aug. 17, 1643) and by the English Parliament and the Westminster Assembly (Sept. 25, 1643). Written by Alexander Henderson, the covenant was considered primarily a civil agreement by the English Parliamentarians, who needed military allies, but the Scots considered it a guarantee of their religious system. It was signed throughout England and Scotland, and in January 1644 the Scots sent an army to England. King Charles I surrendered to them in 1646. When Oliver Cromwell and the Independents gained control of England, they had little sympathy for the Presbyterians and ignored the covenant. In 1647 Charles I accepted the covenant and was given Scottish military assistance, but he ultimately fell to the Independents and was executed in 1649. The future Charles II signed the covenant, along with the National Covenant (1638), in 1650 and 1651, but neither Cromwell’s Commonwealth nor King Charles II, after the Restoration (1660), honoured the covenants, and they were never renewed.
