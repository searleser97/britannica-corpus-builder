Writ of assistance,  in English and American colonial history, a general search warrant issued by superior provincial courts to assist the British government in enforcing trade and navigation laws. Such warrants authorized customhouse officers (with the assistance of a sheriff, justice of the peace, or constable) to search any house for smuggled goods without specifying either the house or the goods. In common use since the reign of Charles II, the writs did not arouse controversy until a renewal attempt was made in 1761.
Representing Boston merchants before the Superior Court of Massachusetts in February 1761, lawyer James Otis, whom John Adams characterized as a “master of the laws of nature and nations,” made an eloquent attack on the legality of the writs based on the theory of political and social rights that he found in English common law. The writ, Otis said—promising to oppose its like until his dying day—“appears to me the worst instrument of arbitrary power, the most destructive of English liberty and the fundamental principles of law, that ever was found in an English lawbook.” Nonetheless, the writs were continued after confirmation of their legality had been received from England in 1762. When similar warrants were expressly reauthorized by the Townshend Acts (1767), they were challenged for five years in every superior court in the 13 colonies and refused outright in 8 of them. Thus, writs of assistance became a major colonial grievance in the pre-Revolutionary period.
