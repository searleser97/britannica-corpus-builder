Human Rights Act 1998,  legislation that defines the fundamental rights and freedoms to which everyone in the United Kingdom is entitled. Under the act persons in the United Kingdom are able to pursue cases relating to their human rights in U.K. courts. Before the implementation of the Human Rights Act of 1998, in 2000, anyone in the United Kingdom who wished to complain of a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights had to take the case to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France.
The convention rights, listed in Schedule 1 of the act, are as follows:
Some of the rights—such as the prohibition of torture—are absolute, while others are qualified.
The act—as well as making virtually all of the European Convention on Human Rights directly enforceable in the U.K. courts—brought fundamental change to the way in which U.K. courts and tribunals interpret legislation. Section 6 of the act provides that it is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way that is incompatible with a convention right (that is, it cannot act in a way that would breach any of the rights in the convention—this is a positive duty placed on public authorities to uphold the convention rights). Section 3 of the act obliges courts to read and give effect to legislation in a way that is compatible with the convention rights, meaning that when considering any piece of legislation, a court must interpret it in line with the convention rights (for example, any family law provisions have to be considered in light of Article 8: the right to respect for private and family life).
