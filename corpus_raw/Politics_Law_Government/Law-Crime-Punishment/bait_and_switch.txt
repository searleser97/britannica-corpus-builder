Bait and switch,  fraudulent advertising committed by retailers to lure potential customers into their place of business. The practice is dishonest because the retailerâ€™s offer to sell a product or service is not a bona fide one. Rather, it is an attempt to mislead the customer through an alluring but insincere offer (the bait) in order to induce him to purchase a separate product (the switch) that usually generates a higher profit margin for the retailer and costs the consumer more.
Bait-and-switch operations have no intention of selling the originally advertised merchandise. They use the lure of attractive or incredible pricing only as bait to entice the potential consumer to the store. Some common bait-and-switch tactics used by fraudulent salespersons and retailers may include refusing to sell or deliver the advertised product, explaining that the advertised product is flawed, noting that the last unit was sold, or revealing that all remaining units have been damaged. Conversely, a bait and switch does not occur in situations where advertisements specify that limited quantities of the product are available or if the salesperson, who is prepared to sell the advertised product, talks a customer into purchasing something else.
The bait-and-switch confidence game has historically been identified with certain industries, such as electronics stores, automotive dealerships, and similar businesses. In many cases, the originally advertised prices were so low that alert consumers should have been wary of the offers. Both the draw of the incredible prices and the verbal skills of the salesperson are required to successfully complete the bait-and-switch process. If the salesperson is unable to steer the consumer away from the advertised merchandise to the merchandise the retailer desires to sell, then the scam has failed.
