Farmer’s Law, Latin Leges Rusticae,  Byzantine legal code drawn up in the 8th century ad, probably during the reign of Emperor Leo III the Isaurian (717–741), which focused largely on matters concerning the peasantry and the villages in which they lived. It protected the farmer’s property and established penalties for misdemeanors committed by the villagers. It was designed for a growing class of free peasantry, supplemented by the influx of Slavic peoples into the empire, that became a dominant social class in later centuries.
Its provisions concerned property damage, various kinds of theft, and taxation. The village was regarded as a fiscal unit, and payment of a communal tax was required of all members of the community. The land and crops of delinquent farmers could be appropriated by anyone willing to pay the tax.
The significance of the Farmer’s Law lay in its axiom that the landowner was also a taxpayer; its influence was widespread, having an impact on legal developments among the south and east Slavs, particularly in Serbia.
