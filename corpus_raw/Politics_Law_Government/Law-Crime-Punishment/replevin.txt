Replevin, also called revendication,  a form of lawsuit in common-law countries, such as England, Commonwealth countries, and the United States, for return of personal property wrongfully taken and for compensation for resulting loss. Replevin is one of the oldest legal actions, dating to the 14th century. It is now called “claim and delivery.”
The form arose to protect tenants from landlords who abused their “distress of rent” rights. The landlord was entitled to seize a tenant’s goods for nonpayment of rent; often goods more valuable than the unpaid rent were taken. Replevin allowed the tenant to recover such goods. The remedy was later invoked for wrongful taking generally.
Replevin is one of a group of remedies for conversion, the wrongful taking or withholding of personal property. Its significant feature is the return of the item itself, not just its money value—useful in instances in which, for example, a family heirloom is taken (compare trover).
There are limits on the types of personal property recoverable by replevin. The object must be tangible (e.g., one cannot replevin an idea) but may be merely paper (e.g., a stock certificate). It must be identifiable and separable so that it can be seized.
