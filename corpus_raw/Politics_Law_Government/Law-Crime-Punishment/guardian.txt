Guardian,   person legally entrusted with supervision of another who is ineligible to manage his own affairs—usually a child. Guardians fulfill the state’s role as substitute parent. Those for whom guardianships are established are called wards. Guardianships for others than children are usually established by courts for the property or persons of the insane or those otherwise incapable of handling their own affairs. 
Guardianships appeared in ancient Rome under the inheritance laws. English law first codified organized guardianship practices in the 13th century. On the European continent, guardianships appeared at the end of the Middle Ages and followed the Roman model. Modern French and German civil codes have tied guardianships closely to family considerations, giving relatives strong preferential rights of appointment. Most European countries have public agencies for the administration of guardianships, while in the United States that task belongs to the courts.
The guardian’s powers and responsibilities are created by statutes and the courts. He is an officer of the court appointing him. The guardian may be given authority over some particular aspect of the ward’s affairs or, more commonly, over all of his affairs generally.
Once a court decides that a child needs a guardian (usually when the parents have died or disappeared), it carefully screens potential appointees. The court considers the financial status and character of the potential guardian; possible conflicts of interest; the ward’s wishes; and the religious affiliations of the deceased parents. The paramount consideration is the welfare of the child. Thus, the court can revoke a guardian’s authority if he appears to be acting against the ward’s best interests.
