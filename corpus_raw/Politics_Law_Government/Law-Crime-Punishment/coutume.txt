Coutume,  (French: “custom”), in French law, the body of law in force before the Revolution of 1789 in northern and central France. The word is also used in modern France to denote customary law and general custom.
Local custom in medieval France was based on an admixture of Roman law, Frankish law, royal legislation, canon law, and feudal law. At first, each seigneury (manor) had its own customs and justice. After 1200, customs became more uniform within such larger areas as Brittany and Normandy. The south, too, lived largely by unwritten custom, despite an erudite enthusiasm for the revived Roman law of the Byzantine emperor Justinian I. The dominant rules of southern custom, favouring full propriety and partible inheritance among other things, were Roman only to the extent that the southern barbarian codes had been influenced by Roman law. These rules held firm until 1212, when the “custom of France near Paris” was imposed by the northern crusader knights. Throughout France the newly revived Roman law influenced the written custom books which, especially after 1200, tended to define regional uniformities. The learned Roman law had some effect on the coutumes of the north, but it did not replace them.
The coutumes dealt primarily with such matters of private law as property and succession. They differed greatly from one area to the next, and, consequently, a movement arose to record the various coutumes and thereby lessen some of the confusion. During the 13th and 14th centuries, legal scholars recorded the customs of their provinces in books called coutumiers.
Most of the coutumes were compiled during the first half of the 16th century—for example, that of Paris in 1510 and that of Brittany in 1539. Gradually, after 1650, the idea arose that the common law of France resided in all the coutumes. Books written from that point of view, along with the coutumes themselves, provided considerable assistance to those who later drafted the Civil Code of 1804.
