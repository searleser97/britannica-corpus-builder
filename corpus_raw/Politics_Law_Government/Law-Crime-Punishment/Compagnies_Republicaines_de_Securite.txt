Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité (CRS),  special mobile French police force. It was created in 1944 as part of the Sûreté Nationale, which in 1966 was combined with the prefecture of police of Paris to form the Direction de la Sécurité Publique. This in turn was made part of the Police Nationale, under the direction of the minister of the interior. The Police Nationale has responsibility for policing cities with a population of 10,000 or more; the CRS, which makes up about 20 percent of the force, is a reserve force concerned with maintaining public order.
The CRS is divided into 10 regional groups, one for each of France’s military regions, and companies are stationed in the suburbs of Paris and in major regional cities. The force is highly mobile and is used mainly for riot control, maintenance of order during natural disasters, and assisting other branches of the Police Nationale as needed. The CRS, which has a special interest in the control of juvenile delinquency, has sponsored a number of youth camps and clubs since the 1960s.
