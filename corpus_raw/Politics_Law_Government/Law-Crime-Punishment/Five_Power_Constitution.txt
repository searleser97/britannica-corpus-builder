Five-Power Constitution,  system of government proposed by the Chinese revolutionary leader Sun Yat-sen in 1906 as the means through which democracy could be implemented in China after the overthrow of the imperial regime. It provided for a central government composed of five yüan, or branches, of government. As in the United States, where Sun Yat-sen went to school, there were to be legislative, executive, and judicial yüan. The last two branches—the examination yüan, which was to administer the selection of candidates for the bureaucracy, and the censorate, or control, yüan, which was to check up on the honesty and efficiency of the government—were traditional Chinese administrative components. Sun hoped that these divisions would help safeguard the rights of the people.
Although Sun’s Five-Power Constitution was implemented in 1928 by the Kuomintang (Guomindang), or Nationalist, government of Chiang Kai-shek (Jiang Jieshi), most of the government funds were absorbed by the parallel military administration and its various agencies. Moreover, the executive yüan and its diverse ministries dominated all the other yüan and allowed them very little independent power.
The five-yüan system is still maintained by the government on Taiwan.
