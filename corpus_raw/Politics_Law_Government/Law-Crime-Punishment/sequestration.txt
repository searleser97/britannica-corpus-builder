Sequestration,   in its broadest legal sense, the removal of property from a person in possession of the property. In international law, sequestration denotes the seizure of property of an individual by a government, which uses it to its own benefit. A judicial sequestration involves a court decree ordering a sheriff, in some cases, to seize property pending a decision by the court as to who is entitled to it.
In Roman law two persons who fought over a piece of property gave control over it to a third, the sequester, until the dispute could be settled. Later courts, after appointing a sequestrator to take possession of the property, would retain the property until the noncomplying party submitted to the courtâ€™s order. The appointing of a sequestrator is now rare, although sequestration itself is a part of both the civil- and common-law systems.
The purpose of sequestration, in most instances, is essentially one of preservation. The property remains in the custody of the court until it is determined to whom the property belongs. Consequently, under certain statutes, the court may return the sequestered property if a bond is posted to ensure that either the property or indemnification will be available to the rightful owner. See also receivership.
