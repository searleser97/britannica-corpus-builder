Accessory,  in criminal law, a person who becomes equally guilty in the crime of another by knowingly and voluntarily aiding the criminal before or after the crime. An accessory is one kind of accomplice, the other being an abettor, who aids the criminal during the act itself. Common law once treated someone who aided the criminal after the commission of the crime as an accessory after the fact, but U.S. law no longer treats the aider as an accomplice to the crime but rather treats him as guilty of a separate crime, such as obstruction of justice. U.S. law has also largely abrogated the distinction between principal offenders, accessories before the fact, and abettors.
