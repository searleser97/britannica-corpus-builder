Trustee,  in Anglo-American law, a person in whom title to property held in trust is vested and who performs the acts of trust administration. A trust may have more than one trustee. They are usually persons in whom the creator of the trust has confidence or corporations to whom the power to carry out trusts has been given by statute (banks and trust companies). A trustee has such powers as are expressly granted by the trust instrument, are implicit in it, or, as in England, are conferred by statute. Some of the more common powers are to sell assets, make investments, collect and distribute income, make leases, or carry on the business of the creator of the trust.
