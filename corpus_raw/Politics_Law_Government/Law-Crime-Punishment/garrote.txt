Garrote,   device used in strangling condemned persons. In one form it consists of an iron collar attached to a post. The victimâ€™s neck is placed in the collar, and the collar is slowly tightened by a screw until asphyxiation occurs. Another form of garrote is a length of wire with wooden handles at the ends, held by the executioner.
