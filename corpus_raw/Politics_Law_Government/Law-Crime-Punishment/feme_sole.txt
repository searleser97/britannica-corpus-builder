Feme sole,  in Anglo-American common law, a woman in the unmarried state or in the legally established equivalent of that state. The concept derived from feudal Norman custom and was prevalent through periods when marriage abridged women’s rights. Feme sole (Norman French meaning “single woman”) referred to a woman who had never been married or who was divorced or widowed or to a woman whose legal subordination to her husband had been invalidated by a trust, a prenuptial agreement, or a judicial decision. In some instances by custom a woman could execute contracts independent of her husband as a feme sole trader, but generally legal action was required to establish a married woman’s legal separateness from her husband.
