Affray,  fighting in public in a way that endangers or alarms others. Actual violence is not necessary for the offense to occur, however, and an affray may be committed even when an individual brandishes a weapon so as to cause terror to the public. Abusive and threatening words alone will not amount to an affray unless a fight results. In the United States, British common law concerning affray applies, subject to modification by the statutes of particular states.
