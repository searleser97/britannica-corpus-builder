Alimony,   in divorce law, compensation owed by one spouse to the other for financial support after divorce. Alimony aims at support of the one spouse, not punishment of the other. In some places, the term means simply a property settlement irrespective of future support. Alimony has traditionally been granted from husbands to wives but has occasionally been granted from wives to husbands.
Alimony obligations were first imposed by the Egyptians, Greeks, and Hebrews. The practice helped to avoid feuds with the divorced wife’s relatives. Under the Code of Hammurabi, a Mesopotamian husband divorcing his wife without cause had to forfeit a piece of silver. Similarly, Roman law under Justinian I demanded a forfeiture of gold from the guilty spouse in a divorce.
In England, alimony was purely a creation of statute—probably arising out of the medieval church’s belief that divorce could not terminate the obligations of marriage in the eyes of God. Scandinavian countries treat husband and wife as equals in divorce suits, allowing reciprocal claims for injury. Some countries—e.g., Russia, Austria, Belgium, and Romania—allow divorce as a normal cancellation of contract, with financial questions being settled by mutual agreement.
Alimony is either temporary—for support and expenses during the lawsuit; or permanent—for support thereafter. Temporary alimony is designed to enable one party to initiate or defend the divorce suit. The granting of temporary or permanent alimony is within the court’s discretion, as are the frequency and amounts of payments.
