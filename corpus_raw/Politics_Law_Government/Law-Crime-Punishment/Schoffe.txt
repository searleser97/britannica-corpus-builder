Schöffe,   in Germany, a lay jurist or assessor assigned primarily to a lower criminal court to make decisions both on points of law and on fact jointly with professional jurists. A Schöffe may also sit on a higher court.
Since 1976, in the higher court, two Schöffen sit along with three professional jurists. In the lower court, two Schöffen and one professional judge hear cases. Although Schöffen are considered an important part of the German legal system, many professional jurists, including lawyers as well as judges, tend to believe that their influence is continuing to wane and that they may eventually be abolished because of their alleged tendency to project personal rather than legalistic opinions.
The lay jurists were introduced by Charlemagne in the late 8th century as a permanent feature of the judicial system and in some cases were given the same power as judges to make decisions. Originally the Schöffen were not required to have legal training, and by the late 15th century their offices had become hereditary. By the 17th century the Schöffen were being replaced by professional judges. A reversion occurred in the 19th century, when the lay system of Schöffen was reintroduced as a means of tempering the power of the newly initiated jury system in minor criminal cases. The jury was eliminated in 1924, and the Schöffen were removed by the Nazis. Both systems were reinstituted in West Germany in 1950; a law of 1976, however, reduced the number of Schöffen.
The Schöffen are elected by local councils; government officials, doctors, clergymen, and persons more than 65 years of age may be excluded, while persons under 30 are always excluded.
