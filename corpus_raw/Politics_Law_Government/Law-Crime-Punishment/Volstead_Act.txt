Volstead Act, formally National Prohibition Act,  U.S. law enacted in 1919 (and taking effect in 1920) to provide enforcement for the Eighteenth Amendment, prohibiting the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages. It is named for Minnesota Rep. Andrew Volstead, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, who had championed the bill and prohibition.
The act was vetoed by Pres. Woodrow Wilson, but it became law after Congress voted to override the veto. In addition, individual states passed further enabling and enforcing legislation. All the states enacted laws to help carry the Volstead Act into effect, although Nevadaâ€™s was later held unconstitutional. Such state laws were repealed in five cases (New York in 1923; Wisconsin, Montana, and Nevada in 1929; and Illinois in 1931).
