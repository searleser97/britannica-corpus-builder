Will, also called testament,  legal means by which an owner of property disposes of his assets in the event of his death. The term is also used for the written instrument in which the testator’s dispositions are expressed. There is also an oral will, called a nuncupative will, valid only in certain jurisdictions, but otherwise often upheld if it is considered a death-bed bequest.
A brief treatment of wills follows. For full treatment, see inheritance: Wills.
A will is valid if it meets the formalities of the law, which usually, but not always, requires that it be witnessed. The advantage of having a will drawn by an attorney arises from his knowledge of what the law requires. A holograph will, for example, which is usually unwitnessed, is an instrument wholly written in the handwriting of the signer, and it may be accepted as legally binding upon the law to carry out its dispositions, barring the findings of anything that could render it invalid. A will may be considered invalid if, among other instances, the testator was mentally incapable of disposing of his property; if the will imposed unreasonable or cruel demands as a condition of inheritance; or if the testator did not have clear title to the bequeathed assets. Business partners often draw up “mutual wills” involving transfer of business assets upon the death of one partner. See also probate.
