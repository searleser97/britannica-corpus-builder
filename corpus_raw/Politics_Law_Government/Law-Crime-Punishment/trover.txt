Trover,   a form of lawsuit in common-law countries (e.g., England, Commonwealth countries, and the United States) for recovery of damages for wrongful taking of personal property. Trover belongs to a series of remedies for such wrongful taking, its distinctive feature being recovery only for the value of whatever was taken, not for the recovery of the property itself (compare replevin).
Trover damages are measured by the market value of the object (not its replacement cost) plus compensation for deprivation of use and compensation for other losses naturally and proximately caused by the wrongful taking. Plaintiff can also recover interest that would have been earned by the money value of the object and any expense (except attorney’s fees) incurred in attempting to recover the object. If the taker sold the object for more than its market value, plaintiff receives that higher price. If the taker has made improvements on the object (e.g., repainted it), the value of such improvements are not deducted from plaintiff’s recovery unless the taking was by mistake.
