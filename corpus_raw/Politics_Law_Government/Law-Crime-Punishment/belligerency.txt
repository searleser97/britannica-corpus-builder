Belligerency,   the condition of being in fact engaged in war. A nation is deemed a belligerent even when resorting to war in order to withstand or punish an aggressor. A declaration of war is not necessary to create a state of belligerency. For example, the United States and the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China were belligerents during the Korean conflict, though both parties avoided characterizing the hostilities as war.
The 1949 Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War (Geneva Convention III) applies not only to declared war but to any armed conflict between parties to the Geneva conventions and to the occupation of the territory of a party even if unresisted. Under Geneva Convention III, lawful belligerents comprise members of the armed forces as well as the members of militias, voluntary corps, and organized resistance groups who are commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates, have a distinctive sign, carry arms openly, and conduct operations lawfully. A nation departing from strict neutrality by giving assistance to one of the contending factions in a war may still be considered a nonbelligerent under certain circumstances. See also Geneva conventions; neutrality.
