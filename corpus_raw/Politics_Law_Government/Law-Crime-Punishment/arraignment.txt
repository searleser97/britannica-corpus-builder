Arraignment,  in Anglo-American law, first encounter of an accused person with the court prior to trial, wherein that person is brought to the bar and the charges are read. The accused usually enters a plea of guilt or innocence. If the accused chooses not to plead, a plea of not guilty will be entered for him or her. A guilty plea will usually result in the caseâ€™s being handed over for judgment. Sometimes the court will permit a guilty plea to be withdrawn.
In civil-law countries arraignment does not exist, but accused parties must be brought before an investigating magistrate within a certain time, and the magistrate in turn must give the findings to the trial judge within a specified period. See also indictment.
