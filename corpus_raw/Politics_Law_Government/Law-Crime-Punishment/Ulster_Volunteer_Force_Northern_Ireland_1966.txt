Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF),  Protestant paramilitary organization founded in Northern Ireland in 1966. Its name was taken from a Protestant force organized in 1912 to fight against Irish Home Rule. Augustus (Gusty) Spence was the group’s best-known leader. The UVF was affiliated with the Progressive Unionist Party (PUP) from the party’s founding in 1977.
Dedicated to upholding Northern Ireland’s union with Britain at all costs, the UVF quickly announced its intention to kill members of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), a commitment it upheld. The organization also murdered unaffiliated Roman Catholics, Protestants, and even members of its own and rival paramilitary groups.
Prone to infiltration and vulnerable to informants, the UVF had a long history of convictions. In 1977, for example, 26 members of the organization were sentenced to a total of 700 years’ imprisonment for murder and other crimes, and in 1979 another 11 members were convicted of the murder of 19 Catholics.
From 1994 the UVF and other Protestant paramilitary groups, including the Ulster Defense Association (UDA), maintained a cease-fire, which was declared in response to an IRA cease-fire earlier that year. However, disagreement within the UVF over the cease-fire led to a split in the organization and the formation of the Loyalist Volunteer Force, which began its own campaign of violence. In May 2007 the UVF renounced violence and pledged to end its armed campaign.
In the 1990s the PUP gained popular attention as the political voice of the UVF. Representing working-class Unionists and paramilitary prisoners and their families, the PUP participated in the multiparty peace talks that led to the Good Friday Agreement (April 1998) and the release of prisoners. In elections in June 1998 the PUP won two seats in the new Northern Ireland Assembly, but it lost one of the seats in the 2003 elections.
