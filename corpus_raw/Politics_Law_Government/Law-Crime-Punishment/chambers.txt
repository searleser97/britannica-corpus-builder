Chambers,  in law, the private offices of a judge or a judicial officer where he hears motions, signs papers, and deals with other official matters when not in a session of court. The custom can be traced to 17th-century England, although it received no statutory sanction until the early 18th century, at which time judges were given the power to sit in chambers between terms of the court. Later, they were given the power to sit any time the court was not in session. Barristersâ€™ offices in an Inn of Court are also known as chambers.
