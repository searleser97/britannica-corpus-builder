Guayaquil Conference,   (July 26–27, 1822), meeting between Simón Bolívar and José de San Martín, leaders of the South American movement for independence from Spain. Late in 1821, when San Martín’s campaign for the liberation of Peru was faltering, he wrote to Bolívar, whose army was then in possession of Ecuador, that the two of them must join forces if the struggle for independence was to succeed. Bolívar agreed enthusiastically, and the two met at Guayaquil, Ecuador, but they failed to agree. Both men had eagerly anticipated their first encounter, but their mutual respect and common cause did not obscure their rivalry. The flamboyant and self-assertive Bolívar stood in sharp contrast to the reflective and self-effacing San Martín.
Bolívar wished to accomplish the liberation of Peru himself in spite of San Martín’s previous efforts there, and as a republican he rejected San Martín’s contention that the disruptive political factions in Peru would be best contained for the national good by a monarch. No record of the Guayaquil conversations was retained, except for a few details that were given in subsequent correspondence between the two men. Apparently, San Martín offered to serve under Bolívar’s command, but Bolívar seemed to be unwilling to share the task of liberation.
The result was that San Martín retired from active service in the wars of liberation and from the political imbroglio in Peru, and Bolívar’s forces delivered the final blow to the Spanish colonial regime in South America at the Battle of Ayacucho two years later.
