Doctors’ Commons,  formerly a self-governing teaching body of practitioners of canon and civil law. Located in London, it was similar to the Inns of Court, where English common law, rather than civil law, was taught. Members of the Doctors’ Commons were those who held degrees either of doctor of civil law at Oxford or doctor of law at Cambridge and who subsequently had been admitted as advocates (similar to admittance to the bar for common lawyers) by the dean of arches, the presiding officer of the Court of Appeal under the authority of the archbishop of Canterbury. Members of the governing body, called fellows, were elected from the advocates by existing fellows. The members practiced in the ecclesiastical courts and in the Court of Admiralty. They also participated in arbitrations involving questions of international law.
In 1565 the society leased a site in Paternoster Row, near the north side of St. Paul’s Cathedral, which served as its headquarters until 1568, when it moved south of the cathedral to Knightrider Street. In 1858 the society was dissolved, under terms of the Court of Probate and Matrimonial Causes acts of 1857. These measures were forerunners of the Judicature Act of 1873, which established a single supreme court of the judicature that inherited the jurisdiction of the courts of civil law as well as those of common law and equity, with a single bar practicing before it.
