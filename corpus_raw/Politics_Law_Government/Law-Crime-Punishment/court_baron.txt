Court baron, Latin Curia Baronis,   (“baron’s court”), medieval English manorial court, or halimoot, that any lord could hold for and among his tenants. By the 13th century the steward of the manor, a lawyer, usually presided; originally, the suitors of the court (i.e., the doomsmen), who were bound to attend, acted as judges, but the growing use of juries rendered their function obsolete. The 17th-century jurist Sir Edward Coke distinguished between two forms of the manorial court: the court baron for free tenants and the customary court for those who were not free. In the 12th and 13th centuries, however, there was no distinction between the two. The manorial court usually met every three weeks and considered personal actions between its suitors. The lord had considerable power over his bound tenants, but he had only civil jurisdiction over his free tenants, and that was increasingly diminished by the growing use of royal writs. Much of the business of the court was to administer the “custom of the manor” and to admit copyhold tenants; the proceedings were recorded on the court roll.
