Chisholm v. Georgia,  (1793), U.S. Supreme Court case distinguished for at least two reasons: (1) it showed an early intention by the Court to involve itself in political matters concerning both the state and federal governments, and (2) it led to the adoption of the Eleventh Amendment, which forbade a citizen of one state from suing another state in a federal court without the consent of the defendant state.
In 1792 the executors of the estate of a South Carolina citizen, Alexander Chisholm, sued the state of Georgia in the Supreme Court to force payment of claims made against that state. Georgia refused to appear before the Court, denying the Court’s authority to hear cases in which a state was a defendant. The Court, citing Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution, rendered a decision for the plaintiff. Georgia then challenged both the decision and the Court’s jurisdiction.
In 1795 the Eleventh Amendment was adopted, removing the Court’s jurisdiction in such cases. A citizen suing a state in a state court may, however, bring that suit on appeal to a federal court.
