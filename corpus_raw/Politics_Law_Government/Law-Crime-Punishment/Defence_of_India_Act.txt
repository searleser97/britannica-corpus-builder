Defence of India Act,  (1915), legislation designed to give the government of British India special powers to deal with revolutionary and German-inspired threats during World War I (1914–18), especially in the Punjab. A special legal tribunal was set up to deal with such cases without prior commitment and with no appeal. Power was also taken for the internment of suspects.
By 1918 there were about 800 internees detained under this and other provisions. The act, being a wartime measure, was due to expire six months after the end of hostilities. The extension of its provisions in the Rowlatt Acts of February 1919 started the agitation that led to the noncooperation movement of Mahatma Gandhi in 1920–22.
