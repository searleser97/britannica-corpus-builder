Burgage,  in Normandy, England, and Scotland, an ancient form of tenure that applied to property within the boundaries of boroughs, or burghs. In England land or tenements within a borough were held by payment of rent to the king or some other lord; the terms varied in different boroughs. Among English feudal tenures, burgage ranked as a form of socage, the holding of land in return for agricultural or economic services. In Scotland the landlord was always the king; and in feudal times tenures were held in return for military service in the burgh garrison. In Scotland burgage remained a distinctive tenure until modern times, requiring a particular form for the transference of titles until 1874.
