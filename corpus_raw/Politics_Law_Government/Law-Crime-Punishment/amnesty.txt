Amnesty,  in criminal law, sovereign act of oblivion or forgetfulness (from Greek amnÄ“sia) for past acts, granted by a government to persons who have been guilty of crimes. It is often conditional upon their return to obedience and duty within a prescribed period. Amnesty is granted usually for political crimes against the state, such as treason, sedition, or rebellion. It is addressed generally to classes or communities and takes the form of a legislative act or other constitutional or statutory act of the supreme power of the state. Thus, in 1865 U.S. Pres. Andrew Johnson issued a proclamation granting full pardon to all former Confederates (except certain leaders) who would take an unqualified oath of allegiance to the United States. Technically, however, an amnesty differs from a general pardon in that the latter simply relieves from punishment whereas the former declares innocence or abolishes the crime.
