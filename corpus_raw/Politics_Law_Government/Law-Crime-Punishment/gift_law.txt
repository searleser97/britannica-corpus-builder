Gift,   in law, a present or thing bestowed gratuitously. The term is generally restricted to mean gratuitous transfers inter vivos (among the living) of real or personal property. A valid gift requires: (1) a competent donor; (2) an eligible donee; (3) an existing identifiable thing or interest; (4) an intention to donate; (5) delivery; i.e., a transfer of possession to or for the donee and a relinquishment by the donor of ownership, control, and power to revoke (except in gifts mortis causa; i.e., those that are made by someone believing himself to be near death and that become final only if the giver dies); and (6) acceptance by the donee. Formal acceptance is necessary under French law, but Anglo-American law acknowledges implied acceptance.
