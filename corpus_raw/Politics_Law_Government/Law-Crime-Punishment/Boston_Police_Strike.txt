Boston Police Strike,   (1919), strike of about 80 percent of Boston’s police force protesting the opposition to their attempt to organize a union. The Boston police force, which had sought affiliation with the American Federation of Labor after World War I, was denied the right to unionize by the city’s police commissioner. On September 9, 1919, the police went on strike.
Without police protection, the city was quickly experiencing robberies and riots. Mayor Andrew J. Peters called in Boston companies of militia, restoring order and breaking the strike. Later, Governor Calvin Coolidge—who had refused to act earlier to prevent the strike—sent in the entire Massachusetts militia even though the situation was then under control. The troops fired on a mob, killing two people.
Coolidge came to be regarded as the hero of the entire episode. Declaring, “There is no right to strike against the public safety by anybody, anywhere, anytime,” Coolidge gained a national reputation as a staunch supporter of law and order. His role in the Boston police strike led largely to his nomination for vice president on the 1920 Republican ticket (he succeeded to the presidency following Warren G. Harding’s death in 1923).
