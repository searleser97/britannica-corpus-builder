Conversion,   in law, unauthorized possession of personal property causing curtailment of the owner’s possession or alteration of the property. The essence of conversion is not benefit to the wrongful taker but detriment to the rightful owner.
Conversion concerns possession, not ownership; thus, unauthorized taking of an object from a renter is the same as if the renter were owner. The property must be personal—as opposed to land—but may be merely a paper (e.g., a club membership card) entitling the possessor to something.
To be conversion, a taking of property must be without the owner’s consent. There must be some act giving the taker some control over the object, though actual physical removal is not essential.
The taking need not be malicious or even knowledgeable. Thus, one can commit conversion unaware of the owner’s claim—although sometimes the owner must give notice of ownership (when a taker might believe the item has been abandoned). If the owner’s mistaken belief that the object is not his causes a wrongful taking, however, that taking is not conversion.
Besides ordinary unauthorized takings, certain exceptional situations constitute conversion: detention of goods under an invalid contract; obtaining goods by fraud or duress; sale of another’s property, if delivered; taking of specific money (e.g., in a lost wallet).
Legal remedies for conversion used to be a tangle of formalities under the common law, but modern statutes have greatly simplified these. Generally the remedies for conversion allow return of the object taken and compensation for deprivation of its use, interest that would have been earned by the monetary value of the object and the cost of seeking its return (not including attorney’s fees).
