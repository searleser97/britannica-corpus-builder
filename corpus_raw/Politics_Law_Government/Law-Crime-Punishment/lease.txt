Lease,   a contract for the exclusive possession of property (usually but not necessarily land or buildings) for a determinate period or at will. The person making the grant is called the lessor, and the person receiving the grant is called the lessee. Two important requirements for a lease are that the lessee have exclusive possession (nonexclusive possession would call for a license) and that the lessorâ€™s term of interest in the property be longer than the term of the lease (a grant involving an equal term or period would comprise a conveyance or assignment, not a lease).
