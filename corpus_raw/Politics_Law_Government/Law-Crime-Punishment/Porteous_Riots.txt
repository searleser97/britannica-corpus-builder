Porteous Riots,   (1736), celebrated riots that erupted in Edinburgh over the execution of a smuggler. The incident had Jacobite overtones and was used by Sir Walter Scott in his novel The Heart of Midlothian.
On April 14, 1736, a smuggler, Andrew Wilson, who had won popular sympathy in Edinburgh by helping a friend escape from Tolbooth Prison, was hanged. A small riot broke out at the execution, and the city guard fired into the crowd, killing a few and wounding a considerable number of persons. John Porteous, captain of the city guard, who was accused of both shooting and giving the order to fire, was brought to trial in July and sentenced to death. After he had sent a petition for pardon to Queen Caroline, then acting as regent in the absence of George II, his execution was postponed. The granting of a reprieve was hotly resented by the people of Edinburgh, and on the night of September 7 an armed body of men in disguise broke into the prison, seized Porteous, and hanged him on a signpost in the street. It was said that persons of high position, some with Jacobite sympathies, were involved; but, although the government offered rewards, no one was ever convicted of participation in the murder. The sympathies of the people and even, it is said, of the clergy, throughout Scotland, were so unmistakably on the side of the rioters that the original stringency of the bill introduced into Parliament for the punishment of the city of Edinburgh had to be reduced to the levying of a fine of £2,000, to be paid to Porteous’ widow, and the disqualification of the provost from holding any public office.
