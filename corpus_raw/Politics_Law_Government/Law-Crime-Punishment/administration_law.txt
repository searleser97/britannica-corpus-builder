Administration,  in law, the management of an estate by a person, other than the legal owner, appointed or supervised by a court. The term is most often used to describe the management of a decedent’s estate by an administrator or executor, a ward’s estate by a guardian, the estate of a person deemed mentally incompetent by a conservator or committee, a bankrupt estate by a trustee, and, generally, of a trust fund by a trustee. Every such fiduciary is held to a high standard of care and is strictly accountable for the estate’s management. Ordinarily a fee is charged for such services. Fiduciary management is to a large extent carried on by professional trustees, especially trust companies.
