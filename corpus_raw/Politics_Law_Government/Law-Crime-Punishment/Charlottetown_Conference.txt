Charlottetown Conference,   (1864), first of a series of meetings that ultimately led to the formation of the Dominion of Canada. In 1864 a conference was planned to discuss the possibility of a union of the Maritime Provinces. The Province of Canada (consisting of present-day Ontario and Quebec) requested and received permission to send a delegation. Consequently the conference, which convened at Charlottetown, P.E.I., on Sept. 1, 1864, consisted of five delegates from each of the three Maritime Provinces and eight delegates from the Province of Canada.
The proposed union of the three Maritime Provinces was unpopular, particularly in Prince Edward Island. The original purpose of the conference was greatly altered by the arrival of the Canadian delegates, who, on September 2, were invited to present their case and who argued in favour of a union of Canada and the Maritime Provinces.
On September 7 the Maritime delegates met by themselves to discuss the original proposal, but they failed to reach agreement. With the idea of a federation of the Maritime Provinces and Canada now having gained greater appeal, the Charlottetown Conference adjourned. But the delegates reconvened in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on Sept. 10 and 12, 1864, and in Quebec city, on Oct. 10â€“27, 1864. The Quebec Conference resulted in a draft constitution for the proposed federal union.
