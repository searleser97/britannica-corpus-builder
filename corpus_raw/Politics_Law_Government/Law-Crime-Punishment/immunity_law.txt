Immunity,  in law, exemption or freedom from liability.
In England and the United States legislators are immune from civil liability for statements made during legislative debate. They are also immune from criminal arrest, although they are subject to legal action for crime. French law and practice prohibits the arrest of a member of the legislature during a session without authorization by that chamber. This practice prevails in many European and other nations.
Under international treaty a diplomatic representative is exempt from local jurisdiction, both civil and criminal. This diplomatic immunity extends to the representative’s places of office and residence.
A public prosecutor may grant immunity from prosecution to a witness who is suspected of criminal activity in return for that individual’s testimony against other suspected criminals. In U.S. law there are two types of criminal immunity—transactional immunity and use immunity. A person granted transactional immunity may not be prosecuted for any crime about which that person testifies as a result of the immunity grant. The testimony of a person granted use immunity may not be used against that person, but that person may still be prosecuted for the crime using other evidence. To compel cooperation by the witness, use immunity must also protect the witness from derivative use—that is, from use of information obtained from the witness to locate other witnesses or evidence against that witness.
