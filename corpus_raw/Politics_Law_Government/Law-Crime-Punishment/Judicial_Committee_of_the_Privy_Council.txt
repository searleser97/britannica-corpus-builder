Judicial Committee of the Privy Council,  British tribunal composed of certain members of the Privy Council that, on petition, hears various appeals from the United Kingdom, the British crown colonies, and members of the Commonwealth that have not abolished this final appeal from their courts.
The tribunal’s authority derives from the Judicial Committee Act of 1833, but its origins lie much further back in English history. From the earliest times the king has been accounted the supreme source of justice, and his council has always had judicial as well as advisory functions. In the later Middle Ages, when courts for all ordinary causes were well established, a form of residual justice remained with the king for some matters and was dealt with by the king’s council working in committees. These committees were the source of some of the prerogative courts that fell into disrepute in the 17th century and were abolished or no longer used by 1689. After this date, appeals to the sovereign, especially from overseas, were dealt with by a general committee of the Privy Council. In 1833 the special judicial tribunal known as the Judicial Committee was created, to be made up of the lord chancellor, the lord of appeals in ordinary, any privy councillors who have held such offices in the past, and the president and former presidents of the Privy Council. Judges from British colonies and independent Commonwealth countries are also included.
The committee may sit in divisions and hear various cases simultaneously and is in no way bound by previous decisions. Its judgment is made in the form of a report to the sovereign, and this decision may be implemented by an order in council. The sovereign retains the power to refer any question to the committee, and such special references are still made. Under the Constitutional Reform Act of 2005, cases involving devolution are now heard by the Supreme Court, also created by the Act.
