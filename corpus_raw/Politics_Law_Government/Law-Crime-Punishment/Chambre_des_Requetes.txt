Chambre des Requêtes,   (French: Chamber of Petitions), in France under the ancien régime, a chamber of the Parlement of Paris with responsibilities for examining the petitions of parties desiring to bring a case before the Parlement and for acting as a court of first instance for those with committimus (exemption from justice in lower courts).
The Chambre des Requêtes grew out of what were known as the “courts at the gate,” which handled petitions sent to the king. Those requesting pardons were sent to the maîtres des requêtes de l’hôtel (“masters of petitions to the king’s household”), which was directly under the control of the king’s council. The Chambre des Requêtes du Palais handled the other petitions for royal grace and gradually allied itself with the Parlement of Paris.
Through the years its functions were narrowed to those involving citizens with committimus and the issuing of letters of justice that authorized the bringing of a case in Parlement. A second chamber was created in the 16th century. The issue of the abuses of the power of committimus was sometimes raised in the years immediately prior to the French Revolution, but efforts to force Louis XVI to abolish the Chambre des Requêtes were mostly unsuccessful. The Chambre was abolished briefly in 1774 but was reinstituted in 1775 and remained in existence until the Revolution. See also Parlement.
