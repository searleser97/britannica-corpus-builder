Freehold,   in English law, ownership of a substantial interest in land held for an indefinite period of time. The term originally designated the owner of an estate held in free tenure, who possessed, under Magna Carta, the rights of a free man. A freehold estate was distinguished from nonfreehold estates such as copyhold, tenancy at will, and tenancy for a fixed period, the customary landlordâ€“tenant relationship. Knight service and frankalmoign, which required military and ceremonial services respectively, and free socage, which involved certain services of husbandry or manual labour, were types of free tenure. See also copyhold; socage.
