Third Amendment,  amendment (1791) to the Constitution of the United States, part of the Bill of Rights, that prohibits the involuntary quartering of soldiers in private homes.
Although the Third Amendment has never been the direct subject of Supreme Court scrutiny, its core principles were among the most salient at the time of the founding of the republic. Prior to and during the American Revolution (1775–83), the British, under King George III, maintained what amounted to standing armies in the colonies, with soldiers commonly quartered in private homes. This constant military presence and the abuses to individuals and property associated with it not only galvanized colonial opposition to the British but also compelled Thomas Jefferson to specifically admonish King George III in the Declaration of Independence “for quartering large bodies of armed troops among us.” With the conclusion of the Revolution and the ratification of the Constitution, support for an amendment that would prohibit the quartering of troops in times of peace was a paramount concern. However, as the history of the country progressed with little conflict on American soil, the amendment has had little occasion to be invoked. As a matter of constitutional law, it has become one marginally cited piece of the fabric of privacy-rights jurisprudence.
