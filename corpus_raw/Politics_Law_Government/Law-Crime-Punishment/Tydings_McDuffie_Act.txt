Tydings-McDuffie Act, also called Philippine Commonwealth and Independence Act,  (1934), the U.S. statute that provided for Philippine independence, to take effect on July 4, 1946, after a 10-year transitional period of Commonwealth government. The bill was signed by U.S. Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt on March 24, 1934, and was sent to the Philippine Senate for approval. Although that body had previously rejected the similar Hare-Hawes-Cutting Act, it approved the Tydings-McDuffie Act on May 1.
Following the terms of the independence act, Filipinos elected delegates for a constitutional convention on July 10, and Roosevelt approved the Philippine constitution on March 23, 1935. The Commonwealth government, under the presidency of Manuel Quezon, was inaugurated in November of that year. For the next 10 years the Philippines remained U.S. territory. Foreign affairs, defense, and monetary matters remained under U.S. jurisdiction, but all other internal matters were in the hands of the Philippine people. During the Commonwealth period, duties were to be imposed on a graduated scale, but the trade provisions were subsequently amended in 1939 in favour of the Philippines.
