Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions,     (1798), in U.S. history, measures passed by the legislatures of Virginia and Kentucky as a protest against the Federalist Alien and Sedition Acts. The resolutions were written by James Madison and Thomas Jefferson (then vice president in the administration of John Adams), but the role of those statesmen remained unknown to the public for almost 25 years.
Written anonymously by Jefferson and sponsored by his friend John Breckinridge, the Kentucky resolutions were passed by that state’s legislature on November 16, 1798. Jefferson’s principal arguments were that the national government was a compact between the states, that any exercise of undelegated authority on its part was invalid, and that the states had the right to decide when their powers had been infringed and to determine the mode of redress. The Kentucky resolutions thus declared the Alien and Sedition Acts to be “void and of no force.”
The resolutions crafted by Madison, while the same in substance as Jefferson’s, were more restrained. Passed by the Virginia legislature on December 24, 1798, they affirmed state authority to determine the validity of federal legislation and declared the acts unconstitutional.
The Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions were primarily protests against the limitations on civil liberties contained in the Alien and Sedition Acts rather than expressions of full-blown constitutional theory. Later references to the resolutions as authority for the theories of nullification and secession were inconsistent with the limited goals sought by Jefferson and Madison in drafting their protests.
