Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States,  case in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on Dec. 14, 1964, that in passing Title II of the Civil Rights Act (1964), which prohibited segregation or discrimination in places of public accommodation involved in interstate commerce, the U.S. Congress did not exceed the regulatory authority granted to it by the commerce clause of Article I of the U.S. Constitution. The court thereby declared that Title II was constitutional.
After Pres. Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act on July 2, 1964, the owner of the Heart of Atlanta Motel in Georgia, who had previously refused to accept black customers, filed suit in federal district court, alleging that the prohibition of racial discrimination contained in Title II of the Civil Rights Act represented an invalid exercise of Congress’s constitutional power to regulate interstate commerce. The owner also claimed that the title violated the Fifth Amendment’s guarantees of due process and just compensation for the taking of private property because it deprived him of the right to choose his customers and that it violated the Thirteenth Amendment’s prohibition of involuntary servitude because it compelled him to rent rooms to blacks. The district court upheld the constitutionality of Title II and issued a permanent injunction requiring the motel to cease discriminating against black customers. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court, where oral arguments were heard on Oct. 5, 1964. In a unanimous (9–0) ruling issued on December 14, the court affirmed the district court’s finding. In his opinion for the court, Justice Tom C. Clark argued that the motel’s transactions clearly affected interstate commerce and thus fell within the purview of congressional regulation, and he rejected the petitioner’s arguments that the title violated the Fifth and Thirteenth amendments as misguided in point of both history and law.
