Non expedit,   (Latin: “it is not expedient”), a late 19th- and early 20th-century policy of the Roman Catholic church that prohibited its Italian members from participating in politics. The non expedit dramatically emphasized that Pope Pius IX and his successors refused to recognize the newly formed Italian state, which had deprived the papacy of its lands in central Italy.
In the early 1860s a Turin journalist, Giacomo Margotti, had coined the phrase nè eletti nè elettori (“neither elected nor electors”) in launching a campaign urging that devout Roman Catholics protest the seizure of papal land by not voting. This policy of nonparticipation, the non expedit, was officially adopted by the Holy See in 1868 and was confirmed on successive occasions through the 19th century (notably by Pius IX in 1874).
Enough Roman Catholics observed the non expedit to cause a significant political absenteeism and preclude the formation of a strong conservative party in Italian national politics. Local government was exempted from the ban out of fear for the growing power of the left. Seeking better relations with the Italian government, Pope Pius X virtually ended the non expedit in 1904–05. Benedict XV formally ended it in 1919, giving his approval to the Italian Popular Party (PPI). This marked the entrance of Italian Roman Catholics into political life as an organized force.
