Kaishintō, in full Rikken Kaishintō, English Constitutional Reform Party,  a leading Japanese political party from its founding in 1882 by the democratic leader Ōkuma Shigenobu until its merger with several smaller parties in 1896. It generally represented the urban elite of intellectuals, industrialists, and merchants. Its platform, like that of its main opponent, the Jiyūtō (“Liberal”) Party, called for the adoption of parliamentary democracy, with a constitutional monarchy functioning along British lines. In the first elections to the Diet (national parliament) in 1890, the Kaishintō emerged as the second largest party after the Jiyūtō. The Kaishintō called for strengthening a parliament elected by the richer classes in order to check the patronage powers of the central government.
The party adopted an increasingly nationalistic tone in the 1890s, advocating Japanese intervention in Korea and confrontation with China on the eve of the Sino-Japanese War (1894–95). In 1896 it merged with several smaller nationalistic parties to form the Shimpotō (“Progressive”) Party).
