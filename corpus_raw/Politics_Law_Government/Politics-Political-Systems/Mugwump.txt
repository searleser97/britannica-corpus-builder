Mugwump,  in U.S. politics, member of a reform-oriented faction of the Republican Party that refused to support the candidacy of James G. Blaine for the presidency in 1884. Instead, the Mugwumps supported the Democratic nominee, Grover Cleveland. Their leaders included George William Curtis, E.L. Godkin, and Charles Francis Adams, Jr. (Theodore Roosevelt and Henry Cabot Lodge offered support without deserting Blaine.) The term Mugwump, first used by Charles A. Dana in the New York Sun, was derived from the Algonquian Indian word mogkiomp (“great man” or “big chief”). In U.S. political slang, mugwump came to mean any independent voter, and later the term was adopted in England.
