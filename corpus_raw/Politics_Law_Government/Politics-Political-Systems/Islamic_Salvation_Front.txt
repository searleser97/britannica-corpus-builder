Islamic Salvation Front, French Front Islamique du Salut (FIS),  Algerian Islamist political party. Known best by its French acronym, the organization was founded in 1989 by Ali Belhadj and Abbasi al-Madani. The party won a majority of the seats contested in local elections in 1990 and most of the seats in the National Assembly in the first round of balloting in 1991. The government canceled the second round, however, and arrested many of the groupâ€™s leaders. The FIS and more extreme Islamist groups afterward waged a protracted guerrilla war, in which atrocities by both sides were alleged to have occurred. The group was blamed for the assassination of Pres. Mohamed Boudiaf, but no clear proof was ever found. See also Armed Islamic Group; Liamine Zeroual.
