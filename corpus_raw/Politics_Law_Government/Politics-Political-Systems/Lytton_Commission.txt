Lytton Commission,  (1931–32), investigation team that was led by V.A.G.R. Bulwer-Lytton, 2nd Earl of Lytton, and was appointed by the League of Nations to determine the cause of the Japanese invasion of Manchuria begun on Sept. 18, 1931.
After extensive research and a six-week stay in Manchuria (Northeast Provinces), the commission submitted its report in September 1932. It found both parties guilty, blaming the Chinese for their anti-Japanese propaganda and refusal to compromise but branding Japan as an aggressor. Japan, which had meanwhile created the puppet state of Manchukuo out of its new possessions, not only rejected the commission’s findings but also resigned from the League of Nations, thus removing itself from the sanctions of that international body and destroying any hope for reconciliation between the two nations. Friction between China and Japan continued until it resulted in all-out war in 1937.
