Wardrobe,  in medieval English history, a department of the king’s household that became an office of state, enjoying in the 13th and early 14th centuries a period of political importance unparalleled in any other European country.
Originally part of the King’s Chamber, the Wardrobe, a small adjacent room in which kings kept their clothes and treasures, first became a distinct government agency in the late 12th century as part of the process in which sections of the royal household became in effect departments of government. Its small staff of clerks became independent of those of the Chamber, and, since they had custody of the king’s ready cash and jewels, it was a natural development for them to keep accounts of the king’s privy purse, to purchase household stores, to pay mercenaries, and to lend small sums, as well as to receive payments made to the king as he traveled around the country. The treasurer, or keeper, of the Wardrobe kept its accounts, presenting them for audit to the Exchequer, and his immediate subordinate, the controller, held the king’s Privy Seal.
Because of its special closeness to the king, the Wardrobe became involved in the constitutional conflicts of the period. Used by Henry III in 1232 to enable him to throw off the dominance of his great officers of state (the justiciar, the treasurer, and the chancellor), the power of the Wardrobe was attacked by rebellious barons in 1258–67 and again in 1311. Despite these attempts to reduce its influence, Edward I, Edward II, and Edward III found it essential to the conduct of their military campaigns and sustained its power and financial autonomy. But during the 14th century, kings began to find in Parliament a useful means of raising extraordinary supply; and, no longer financially essential, the Wardrobe gradually reverted to the position of a mere household department.
