Sortition,   election by lot, a method of choosing public officials in some ancient Greek city-states. It was used especially in the Athenian democracy, from which most information about the practice is derived. With few exceptions, all magistrates were chosen by lot, beginning with the archons in 487–486 bc; likewise the Boule (council) of 500 and the juries of the law courts were chosen by lot. The practice of sortition obviated electoral races and provided for the regular turnover of officeholders. The operations of government were thus not in the hands of experts, but, through the system of sortition, the Athenian democracy provided at least some practical political education for its citizens.
The rationale of sortition was the equality of all citizens. Only those who had presented themselves as candidates were chosen by lot to fill public offices. Military officers (including the 10 stratēgoi) and some financial officials were selected by voting rather than by sortition. But for the most part executive functions were broken down into small tasks, of which each was entrusted to an annual board of 10 members chosen by lot.
