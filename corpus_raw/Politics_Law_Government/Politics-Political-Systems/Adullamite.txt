Adullamite,   member of a group of English politicians who rebelled against their leaders in the Liberal Party and defeated the Reform Bill of 1866. Their name was derived from the biblical reference to the caves of Ê¿Adullam (1 Samuel 22:1), which served as a refuge for the discontented. The Liberal politician John Bright applied the term to party rebels who opposed the extension of the franchise proposed by W.E. Gladstone and John Russell, 1st Earl Russell, in 1866. Some of the group of about 40 members of Parliament acted out of fear of losing their seats, but most agreed with their leader Robert Lowe (later Viscount Sherbrooke) in his fear of the effects of democracy.
