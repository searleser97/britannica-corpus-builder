National Action Bloc, Arabic Kutlah al-ʿAmal al-Waṭanī,  first Moroccan political party, founded in 1934 to counteract mounting French domination of Morocco and to secure recognition of the equality of Moroccans and Frenchmen under the French protectorate.
The National Action Bloc attracted young educated Moroccans of many different views. Informally in existence since 1930, under the leadership of such notable figures as Mohammed Allal al-Fassi and Ahmad Balafrej, it maintained a number of publications and launched a vigorous campaign of political instruction among the Muslim population. The bloc became a formal political body in December 1934. While the reform measures it presented to increase the Muslim share of the Moroccan government were rejected by the French, Arabic was finally admitted as a language of the press, alongside French, in 1937. The party, having gained in popular support and influence, was dissolved by the French in the same year, and late in 1937 its leaders either were exiled or fled the country. Ahmad Balafrej returned to Morocco in 1943 and founded the Istiqlāl (Independence) party, which was to lead in Morocco’s struggle for liberation.
