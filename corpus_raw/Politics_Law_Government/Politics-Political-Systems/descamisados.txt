Descamisado,  (Spanish: “shirtless one”), in Argentine history, during the regime of Juan Perón (ruled 1946–55, 1973–74), any of the impoverished and underprivileged Argentine workers who were Perón’s chief supporters.
Under Perón’s rule the political influence of the large landowners (estancieros) was diminished in favour of the lower-middle and working classes. Perón’s wife, née María Eva Duarte, popularly called Evita, became the idol of the descamisados because of her own poor origins and her reputation for using her great influence to benefit the poor. After Evita’s death (July 1952), Perón lost support among the workers.
