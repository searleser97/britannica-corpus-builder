Scott-Moncrieff Commission,  delegation appointed in 1901 by George Nathaniel Curzon, the British viceroy of India, to draw up a comprehensive irrigation plan for India. This was a result of Lord Curzon’s observation of famine conditions soon after his arrival in 1899.
The commission was named for its chairman, Sir Colin Campbell Scott-Moncrieff, who in 1903 recommended measures for the irrigation of an additional 10,200 square miles (26,400 square km) beyond the roughly 30,000 square miles (78,000 square km) already irrigated. The acceptance of these proposals by Lord Curzon’s government in 1905 was a landmark in the government of India’s irrigation policy.
