Estado Novo,  (Portuguese: “New State”), dictatorial period (1937–45) in Brazil during the rule of President Getúlio Vargas, initiated by a new constitution issued in November 1937. Vargas himself wrote it with the assistance of his minister of justice, Francisco Campos.
In the election campaign of 1937 Vargas warned of a threatened Communist coup d’état and declared a 90-day state of emergency, issuing the Estado Novo. The fascist Integralistas applauded this dictum, but they were outwitted by Vargas when he suddenly used his dictatorial powers to announce that he would succeed himself without election and proceeded to dissolve the Congress. He further declared that the constitution contained in his pronouncement would not be effective while the emergency lasted and would then be brought to a plebiscite, after which the people could elect a new congress.
The plebiscite, however, was never conducted, and Vargas ruled for the next seven years by decree, pending a congressional election. Vargas and his appointees more or less dominated all aspects of national life; but the dictatorship, superficially suggestive of contemporary fascist states, was alleviated by its centrist orientation and paternalistic bent. Widespread disaffection with Vargas finally forced him out of power, in spite of a campaign by his supporters (the Queremistas) to have him stand for reelection in 1945 after he had bowed to pressure to permit elections.
