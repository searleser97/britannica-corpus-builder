Drang nach Osten,   (German: “Drive to the East”), German policy or disposition to colonize the Slavic lands east of Germany. The term originally referred to the eastward movement of German settlers in the 12th and 13th centuries but was resurrected by Adolf Hitler in the 20th century to describe his plans for acquiring Lebensraum (“living space”) for Germans.
The medieval Drang nach Osten was part of a general German expansion and was particularly directed toward the territory between the rivers Elbe and Oder. Here peasants could settle land on more favourable terms than farther west, while many knights needed fiefs and lordships to uphold their rank. The great German princes won extensive lands in the region: the Welf duchy of Saxony was supreme in the later 12th century; by 1250 the Ascanian dynasty had large holdings in Brandenburg, while the Wettin margraves of Meissen were powerful farther south. In the 13th century the religious order of the Teutonic Knights won large territories in Prussia and farther north around the shores of the Baltic Sea.
During the 20th century, the German Nazis invoked the Drang nach Osten to glorify their territorial greed directed against Czechoslovakia, Poland, and the Soviet Union. (The phrase occurred in Hitler’s tirades against Czechoslovakia during the late 1930s.) After Germany’s initial successes in World War II, the idea became submerged in more general schemes of world domination.
