Cohabitation,  in politics, the state of affairs in which a head of state serves with an antagonistic parliamentary majority. In semipresidential systems such as that of France, cohabitation entails that the offices of president and prime minister are held by members of competing political parties. Though cohabitation can lead to political crisis, it can also help to bridge ideological divides. For instance, the presidency of Jacques Chirac in France was marked by a long period of cohabitation (1997â€“2002) that encouraged consensus on a number of issues, such as European policy and foreign affairs.
