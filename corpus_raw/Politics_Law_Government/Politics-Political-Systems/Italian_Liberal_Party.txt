Italian Liberal Party, Italian Partito Liberale Italiano (PLI),  moderately conservative Italian political party that dominated Italian political life in the decades after unification (1861) and was a minor party in the period after World War II.
The Liberal Party was first formed as a parliamentary group within the Piedmont assembly in 1848 by Count Camillo di Cavour, who eventually brought about the unification of Italy and became the new nation’s first prime minister (1861). His followers, who favoured a centralized government, a restricted suffrage, regressive taxation, and free trade, became known in the new national parliament as Liberals. There was no tightly organized “Liberal Party” as such but merely various parties and parliamentary groups that formed a dominant voting bloc of basically conservative deputies in the national parliament. The Liberals split into right and left blocs in the 1860s, with the Left Liberals gaining control of the party in 1876. Liberal coalition governments continued to dominate Italian politics until World War I, after which the party’s strength seriously declined. The party existed clandestinely during the fascist period, and in 1944 it reemerged as a minority party, conservative but untainted by fascist associations.
The Liberals maintained a strong anticommunist stance after World War II and subsequently were able to sustain themselves as small but important allies of the dominant Christian Democratic Party, earning important government posts. The modern Italian Liberal Party favoured free enterprise, backed NATO, and drew its chief support from small businessmen. Caught up in various corruption scandals after 1992, the party was dissolved in the mid-1990s, with most Liberals joining the centre-right Forza Italia party.
