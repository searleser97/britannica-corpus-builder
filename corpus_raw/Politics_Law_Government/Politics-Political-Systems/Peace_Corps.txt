Peace Corps,     U.S. government agency of volunteers, established by executive order by Pres. John F. Kennedy on March 1, 1961, and authorized by the U.S. Congress through the Peace Corps Act of September 22, 1961. (From 1971 to 1981 it was a subagency of an independent agency called ACTION.) The first director of the Peace Corps was Kennedy’s brother-in-law R. Sargent Shriver.
 The purpose of the Peace Corps is to assist other countries in their development efforts by providing skilled workers in the fields of education, agriculture, health (there has been a particular emphasis on combating HIV/AIDS), trade, technology, environmental protection, women’s economic empowerment, and community development. Peace Corps volunteers are assigned to specific projects on the basis of their skills, education, and experience. Once abroad, the volunteer is expected to function for two years as a good neighbour in the host country, to speak its language, and to live on a level comparable to that of the volunteer’s counterparts there.
  The Peace Corps grew from 900 volunteers serving 16 countries in 1961 to a peak of 15,556 volunteers in 52 countries in 1966. By 1989 budget cuts had reduced the number of volunteers to 5,100, but over the next two decades there were increases, such that by the Peace Corps’ 50th anniversary in 2011 there were more than 8,500 volunteers serving in 77 countries. In the 1990s the organization’s global reach was extended to include eastern European countries such as Hungary and Poland and republics of the former Soviet Union. Among other countries, China was added in 1993, South Africa in 1997, and Mexico in 2003. By 2018, 141 countries had hosted more than 235,000 Peace Corps volunteers.
Overseas volunteer services akin to the Peace Corps are maintained by other countries, while similar humanitarian work is sponsored by nongovernmental organizations such as Doctors Without Borders.
