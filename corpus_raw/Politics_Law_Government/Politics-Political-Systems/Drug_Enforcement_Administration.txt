Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA),  Agency of the U.S. Department of Justice charged with enforcing laws that cover trafficking in controlled substances. Established in 1973, the DEA works with other agencies to control the cultivation, production, smuggling, and distribution of illicit drugs. Most of its efforts are directed against international narcotics smuggling organizations, but it also works to shut down interstate operations.
