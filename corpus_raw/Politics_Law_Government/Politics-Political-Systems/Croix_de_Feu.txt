Croix de Feu, (French: “Cross of Fire”)  French political movement (1927–36). Originally an organization of World War I veterans, it espoused ultranationalistic views with vaguely fascist overtones. Under François de La Rocque (1885–1946), it organized popular demonstrations in reaction to the Stavisky Affair, hoping to overthrow the government. It subsequently lost prestige and was dissolved by the Popular Front government in 1936.
