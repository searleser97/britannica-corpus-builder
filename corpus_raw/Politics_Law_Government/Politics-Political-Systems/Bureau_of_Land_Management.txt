Bureau of Land Management,  agency of the U.S. Department of the Interior. It was established in 1946 through the consolidation of the General Land Office (created in 1812) and the U.S. Grazing Service (1934). The BLM is responsible for managing hundreds of millions of acres of public land, including timber, minerals, oil and gas, geothermal energy, wildlife habitats, endangered plant and animal species, recreation areas, lands with cultural importance, wild and scenic rivers, designated conservation and wilderness areas, and open-space lands.
