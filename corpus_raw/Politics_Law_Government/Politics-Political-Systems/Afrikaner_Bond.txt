Afrikaner Bond, Afrikaans Afrikaner League,  one of the first organized political parties of Cape Colony, Southern Africa, founded by the Rev. Stephanus Jacobus du Toit in 1879–80. In 1883 it amalgamated with Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr’s Boeren Beschermings Vereeniging (“Farmer’s Protection Association”). Du Toit attempted to create a pan-Afrikaner nationalist Bond with affiliated branches outside the Cape, but this effort foundered, and the unity of Afrikaners in the late 1890s owed more to British imperial intervention in Southern Africa than to Bond policies. Under Hofmeyr’s leadership the Bond advocated a broader nationalism that included the British. Although he never formed a cabinet, Hofmeyr, as the majority leader in the Cape House of Assembly, was able, through the judicious support of the English-speaking politicians, to protect Afrikaner interests during the South African War (1899–1902). In 1910 the Bond joined with Afrikaner parties in the rest of South Africa to form the South African National Party (later the South African Party) and dissolved itself in 1911.
