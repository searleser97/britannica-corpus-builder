Democratic Centralist, Russian Demokratichesky Tsentralist,  in the history of the Soviet Union, member of an opposition group within the Communist Party that objected to the growing centralization of power in party and government organs.
The Democratic Centralist group developed during 1919–20 as the central government and party organs, responding to practical needs created by the Russian Civil War, tightened their control over local soviets and party units. Led by Timofey V. Sapronov, Vladimir M. Smirnov, and Valerian V. Osinsky (Obolensky), the group was composed largely of intellectuals, many of whom had opposed the centralization of state control over industry in 1918. The Democratic Centralists continued their protest through 1920; but at the 10th Party Congress (March 1921) opposition groups were condemned, and the Democratic Centralists, satisfied by the passage of resolutions supporting organizational reforms, became temporarily inactive.
They revived their protests, however, as the party failed to implement its resolutions. In 1923 they joined other opposition elements to criticize the central party leadership (Declaration of the Forty-Six, presented to the Politburo on Oct. 15, 1923), and in 1926–27 they sided with the opposition against Joseph Stalin’s increasing domination of the party. But Stalin defeated the opposition; at the 15th Party Congress (December 1927), 18 Democratic Centralists were expelled from the party. During the purges of the 1930s most of the Democratic Centralists were arrested and either sent to labour camps or executed.
