Board on Geographic Names,  interdepartmental agency of the U.S. government created in 1890 and providing standardized geographic names of foreign and domestic places for use by the federal government. It was established in its present form by a public law enacted in 1947. Located in Washington, D.C., the BGN shares its responsibilities with the Department of the Interior and operates through several committees composed of members of various federal departments and agencies. The BGN publishes a series of gazetteers of foreign countries based on the work of geographers, linguists, and cartographers; gazetteers of Antarctica, undersea features, and most countries except the United States had been published by the early 1980s. Responsibility for producing and distributing the gazetteers lies with the Defense Mapping Agency, Department of the Interior. In the late 1990s a portion of the information gathered by the BGN was made available on the Internet.
