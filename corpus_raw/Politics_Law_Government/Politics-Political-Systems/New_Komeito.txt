New Kōmeitō, English New Clean Government Party, formerly Kōmeitō,  Japanese political party that was founded in 1964 as the political wing of the Buddhist lay movement Sōka-gakkai. It advocates “humanitarian socialism,” an open, independent foreign policy, and, among other things, the gradual abolition of the Japan-U.S. security treaty.
After the 1962 elections to the upper house of the Japanese Diet (national legislature), Sōka-gakkai members held 15 seats and replaced the Democratic Socialist Party as the party or group with the third largest representation in the legislature. In 1964 Kōmeitō was founded, and in July 1965 the Sōka-gakkai–Kōmeitō representation in the upper house increased to 20. In its first lower-house elections, in 1967, Kōmeitō won 25 seats, and by 1979 it had more than doubled its representation to 57 seats. By 1990 its representation had dropped to 45 seats. However, after the ruling Liberal-Democratic Party (LDP) was beset by scandals in 1993, Kōmeitō won 51 seats. In the following year it merged with several opposition parties as the New Frontier Party, which dissolved in 1997.
In 1998 Kōmeitō merged with the New Peace Party to become New Kōmeitō. In the lower-house elections of 2000, New Kōmeitō captured only 31 seats. Subsequent elections to that chamber in 2003 and 2005 yielded about the same level of support for the party—34 and 31 seats, respectively—and it solidified itself as Japan’s third largest party. It retained that ranking in the 2009 lower-house polling, although its total number of seats dipped to 21. The party’s membership in the chamber returned to 31 in the December 2012 elections, but it lost its third-place position to the newly formed Japan Restoration Party headed by Ishihara Shintarō. However, New Kōmeitō joined forces with the victorious LDP to form a two-thirds supermajority in the lower house, and the two parties teamed up again for upper-house elections in July 2013 to secure a simple majority for the coalition in that chamber. The party fared even better in the December 2014 elections to the lower house, when it won 35 seats and helped the LDP retain the coalition’s supermajority.
