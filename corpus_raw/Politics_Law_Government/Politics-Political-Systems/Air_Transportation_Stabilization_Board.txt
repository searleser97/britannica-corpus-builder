Air Transportation Stabilization Board (ATSB),  U.S. governmental entity created in the aftermath of the attacks of September 11, 2001, to maintain and provide for safe and efficient commercial aviation. The board was created by the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act, which was signed by Pres. George W. Bush on September 22, 2001, for the purpose of issuing federal loan guarantees up to $10 billion to airlines experiencing financial difficulties following the terrorist attacks. The board is made up of the secretary of transportation, the chairman of the Federal Reserve System, the secretary of the treasury, and the comptroller general of the United States, or their respective designees.
Applicants must meet three criteria under the act: (1) the airline is unable to obtain a loan without the guarantee, (2) the amount of the loan is prudent with respect to the financial needs of the airline, and (3) the guarantee is necessary for a viable air-transportation system in the United States. ATSB often demands stock warrants or related securities, giving the government an ownership stake in those airlines whose loans are guaranteed.
