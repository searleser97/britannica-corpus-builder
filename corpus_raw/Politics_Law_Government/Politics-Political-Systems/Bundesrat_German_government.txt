Bundesrat,   (German: “Federal Council”), one of the two legislative chambers of the Federal Republic of Germany. It is the Upper House and acts mainly in an advisory capacity, since political power resides in the popularly elected Bundestag, but its consent is required for a large number of laws and regulations as well as for constitutional amendments. It is formed from members of the Land (state) governments, and the number of representatives from each Land depends on the size of its population. Austria also has a Bundesrat, similar in character. The term also was applied to the federal chamber of the German Empire (1871–1918).
