 The Senate is one of the two houses of the bicameral United States Congress, established in 1789 by the Constitution of the United States. It shares equal responsibility for lawmaking with the U.S. House of Representatives. Each state elects two senators for six-year terms. The terms of about one-third of the Senate membership expire every two years.
