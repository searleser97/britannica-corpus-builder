Majoritarianism,  the idea that the numerical majority of a population should have the final say in determining the outcome of a decision.
From the time of classical Greek philosophers through the 18th century, including the founders of the United States such as James Madison, majoritarianism has had a pejorative connotation. It was routinely presumed that the majority of the population was poor and ignorant. It was also presumed that the majority, if given the power and opportunity to do so, would tyrannize over any and all minorities. The latter view was of great concern in the 19th century to English philosopher and economist John Stuart Mill and French historian and political scientist Alexis de Tocqueville, the latter of whom coined the phrase “tyranny of the majority.”
Starting in the 18th century, majoritarianism began to acquire a positive connotation. To begin with, it was argued that any individual or group less than the majority was also capable of tyranny. The classical view had been that only some individuals had the intellectual and moral virtue that enabled them to determine the common good. That view was challenged in the Enlightenment view by French philosophers Jean-Jacques Rousseau and the marquis de Condorcet, who believed that through proper education anyone could be capable of determining the common good.
