Democratic Progressive Party (DPP),  political party in  Taiwan (the Republic of China [ROC]). It was formed in September 1986 by those who initially sought self-determination for people considered to be ethnically Taiwanese, democratic freedoms, the establishment of economic ties with the People’s Republic of China on the mainland, and a multiparty system. The DPP’s advocacy of political liberalization led to the arrest and imprisonment of many of the party’s leading figures. Despite a ban on new political parties (part of the martial law regulations that were in effect from 1949 to 1987), the DPP had been informally organized in 1983. In 1986 it won about 10 percent of the seats in the ROC’s Legislative Yuan, and in the election of December 1989—the first in which opposition groups could contest seats as organized political parties—the DPP won one-fifth of the seats. Amid debates over the political status of Taiwan (i.e., whether or not it was tied to mainland China)—the DPP committed itself to the establishment of a “Taiwanese republic with independent sovereignty”—the party’s popularity declined in the early 1990s.
However, by the late 1990s the DPP had captured more than 30 percent of the legislature’s seats, and in 2000 its leader, Chen Shui-bian, was elected president of the ROC. In December 2001 the party won more than one-third of the seats in the Legislative Yuan, replacing the Nationalist Party (which had ruled continuously since the founding of the ROC) as the largest party in the legislature. Chen was narrowly reelected in 2004; in parliamentary elections that year the DPP remained the largest party in the legislature, but it and its allies lost their majority to the Nationalists and their allies. In the January 2008 parliamentary elections, the DPP suffered a crushing defeat, winning only one-fourth of the legislative seats; the Nationalists captured nearly all of the rest.
