United States Women’s Bureau,  U.S. federal agency, established in 1920 and charged with promoting the rights and welfare of working women.
Such events as the Triangle shirtwaist factory fire in a New York City sweatshop—in which 146 women and girls died—alerted the public to the desperate conditions of factory workers in general and of women in particular. The response to that and similar incidents eventually led to the creation of the United States Women’s Bureau. In July 1918, during World War I, an agency called Women in Industry Service, headed by Mary van Kleeck, was set up in the Department of Labor. It was the forerunner of the department’s permanent peacetime Women’s Bureau, which was established by public law in June 1920.
The Women’s Bureau is the only federal organization devoted to the welfare of working women. Its goals include making women aware of their rights in the workplace, designing laws and policies that promote the interests of working women, collecting and analyzing data relating to women and work, and reporting on research results to the president, Congress, and the nation. Among the highlights of the agency’s history are the inclusion of women’s work under the terms of the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act (which set minimum pay and maximum hours), the passage of the Equal Pay Act in 1963, and many contributions to the design of legislation guaranteeing equal employment opportunity, family and medical leave, and protection against discrimination in hiring because of age or pregnancy.
