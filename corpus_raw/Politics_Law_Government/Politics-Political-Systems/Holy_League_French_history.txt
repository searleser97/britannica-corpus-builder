Holy League, French La Sainte Ligue,  association of Roman Catholics during the French Wars of Religion of the late 16th century; it was first organized in 1576 under the leadership of Henri I de Lorraine, 3e duc de Guise, to oppose concessions granted to the Protestants (Huguenots) by King Henry III. Although the basic reason behind the League’s formation was the defense of the Catholic religion, political reasons, notably the desire to limit the king’s power, were not absent. Henry III, having failed at an attempt to place himself at the head of the Catholic party, ordered its dissolution (September 1577). The League revived in importance in 1584, when the Protestant leader Henry of Navarre (later Henry IV) became heir of the crown. The League set up an alternative candidate to the throne, and in this effort to exclude Henry of Navarre it received the assistance of Spain, the leading Catholic power. The League’s popular support throughout France forced Henry III to placate it by proscribing the Protestant religion (July 1585). To put a decisive end to the League, which was in control of much of France and which continued to challenge his authority, Henry III had the Duc de Guise assassinated (December 1588). The King’s act failed to destroy the League, and he, in turn, was assassinated in August 1589. The Holy League, actively supported by the Spanish, opposed the accession of Henry IV. Only after Henry removed the main reason for opposition to him by becoming a Roman Catholic in July 1593 did the power of the Holy League gradually wane.
