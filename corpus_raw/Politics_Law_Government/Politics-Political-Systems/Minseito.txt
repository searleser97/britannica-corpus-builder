Minseitō, English Democratic Party, or Progressive Party,  prominent pre-World War II Japanese political party that first came to power in 1929 and then vied with the more conservative Rikken Seiyūkai (q.v.; “Friends of Constitutional Government”) for Cabinet control during the next 11 years.
Formed in 1927 by the merger of the former Kenseikai (“Constitutional Association”) and a minor party, the Minseitō attempted to improve Japan’s relations with the West and to lessen military control over the government. A centrist party, the Minseitō was controlled by politicians willing to deal with government bureaucrats for patronage and with business interests to gain funds.
In 1940 the government forced the Minseitō and the Rikken Seiyūkai to merge with the government-controlled Taisei Yokusankai (“Imperial Rule Assistance Association”). After 1945 a new Democratic Party was formed, which included many former Minseitō members.
