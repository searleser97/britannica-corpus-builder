Exchequer,   in British history, the government department that was responsible for receiving and dispersing the public revenue. The word derives from the Latin scaccarium, “chessboard,” in reference to the checkered cloth on which the reckoning of revenues took place.
The Exchequer was constituted as a distinct government agency by Henry I at the beginning of the 12th century. The Treasury, with which the Exchequer was in practice joined, dates from before the Norman Conquest (1066), and the name “Exchequer” came quite early to be applied to the two jointly. The lower Exchequer, or receipt, closely connected with the permanent Treasury, was an office for the receipt and payment of money. The upper Exchequer (the scaccarium proper) was a court sitting twice a year to regulate accounts. It was closely related to the Curia Regis (the “King’s Court,” which itself dates from about the Norman Conquest) and was thus probably designed on the Norman pattern. The business of the ancient Exchequer was mainly financial, though some judicial business connected with accounts was also conducted. In time the upper Exchequer developed into the judicial system, while the lower Exchequer became the Treasury.
In the 19th century a series of parliamentary acts swept away the lower Exchequer’s various departments, leaving only that institution’s name and those of one or two of its officials as relics of the past. “Exchequer” remains the unofficial name of the Treasury in Britain, whose head is called the chancellor of the Exchequer.
