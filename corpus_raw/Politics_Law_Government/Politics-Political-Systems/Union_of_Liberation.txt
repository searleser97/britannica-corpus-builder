Union of Liberation, Russian Soyuz Osvobozhdeniya,  first major liberal political group in Russia. The Union was founded in St. Petersburg in January 1904 to be a covert organization working to replace absolutism with a constitutional monarchy. Originally the creation of liberal nobility, it soon was dominated by middle-class, professional people, who gave the union a new militance.
The Union of Liberation gave expression to this new combativeness in a three-point strategy adopted in October 1904. First, the union would persuade the zemstvos, local councils established by Tsar Alexander II, to ask the throne to grant a constitution. Second, it would stage a series of banquets, ostensibly to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Alexander II’s reform of the law courts but actually to push for liberal political ideals. Third, it would support the formation of unions and their amalgamation into a “union of unions.” Encouraged by the Union of Liberation’s example, many liberal groups passed resolutions demanding a constitution. In time, the leadership of the liberal movement passed to the Constitutional Democratic (Kadet) Party.
