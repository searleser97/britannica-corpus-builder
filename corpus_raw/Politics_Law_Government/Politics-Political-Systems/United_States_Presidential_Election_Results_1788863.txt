 The president and vice president of the United States are formally elected through an electoral college. Members (“electors”) of this electoral college are chosen through the popular vote in each state, and to be elected president a candidate must receive a majority of the electoral votes. If no candidate receives a majority, the president is elected by the House of Representatives, which may choose among the three candidates with the most electoral votes.
Electoral college and popular vote results in U.S. elections are provided in the table.
