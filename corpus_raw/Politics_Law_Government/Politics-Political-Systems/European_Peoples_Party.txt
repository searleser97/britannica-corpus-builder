European People’s Party (EPP), formerly (1953–79) Christian Democrat Group,  transnational political group representing the interests of allied conservative parties in Europe, particularly in the European Union (EU). The EPP was formed in 1953 as the Christian Democrat Group, which acted as a transnational political party in the Common Assembly of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). It consists of more than 40 political parties from EU countries. Numerous other political parties, including those from EU applicants and other countries (e.g., Albania, Croatia, Norway), maintain associate or observer status. In the European Parliament the EPP is represented by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). From 1999 to 2009 this parliamentary group included a conservative contingent of European Democrats (ED) and thus was referred to as the EPP–ED. The EPP is headquartered in Brussels.
The EPP traces its roots to the 1920s, when a conference of Christian Democratic parties was held in Paris. This conference established a secretariat, which fostered cooperation among European conservative parties until its dissolution in 1939. After World War II, coordination among conservative parties reappeared, and, after the Common Assembly first met in 1952, a Christian Democrat group unofficially organized itself. The group was officially recognized by the Common Assembly the following year. The party also traces its roots to Robert Schuman, one of the leading architects of European integration. The EPP has played a leading role in Europe since its founding.
Prior to EU summits, EPP heads of government meet to coordinate strategy. The party is committed to the creation of a federal Europe, and its platform emphasizes the principle of subsidiarity (i.e., that decisions should be made at the lowest appropriate level).
