Your Party, Japanese Minna no Tō (“Everyone’s Party”),  centre-right political party in Japan. It was established in August 2009 by Watanabe Yoshimi—formerly of the Liberal-Democratic Party (LDP), who had resigned from the LDP early that year over policy disagreements with the prime minister, Asō Tarō—and several other members, most of whom had also left the LDP. In Your Party’s first contested election—that for the House of Representatives (lower chamber) of the Diet (national legislature) later that August—it fielded 15 candidates and won 5 seats.
The party scored a larger victory in the July 2010 elections to the House of Councillors (upper chamber): 44 candidates stood for election, and 10 gained seats (for an overall total of 11 members). With the Democratic Party of Japan losing seats in the elections, this gave Your Party considerable influence as a swing party in the upper house and established it as an up-and-coming force in Japanese politics. Party candidates also did well in the next round of elections, garnering 18 seats in the 2012 lower-house contest and winning 8 seats (for a total of 18 members) in the 2013 upper-house polling.
Much of Your Party’s policies are focused on fiscal reforms, including tax reduction, anti-deflationary measures designed to slowly increase prices, liberalized lending practices intended to help small businesses, and more government involvement in the Bank of Japan’s policy decisions. In addition, the party supports administrative reforms intended to reduce the size of the national government and to shift power from bureaucrats in central-government ministries to local-government bodies.
