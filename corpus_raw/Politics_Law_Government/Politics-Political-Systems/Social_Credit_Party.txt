Social Credit Party (Socred),  French Parti du Crédit Social,  minor Canadian political party founded in 1935 by William Aberhart in Alberta and based on British economist Clifford Douglas’s Social Credit theory. By the late 1930s the party had virtually abandoned Douglas’s theories; it now advocates such policies as employee participation in profits and in shareholding.
Douglas’s theory, first promoted in 1919 in the British socialist publication The New Age, sought to remedy the chronic deficiency of purchasing power by issuing additional money to consumers and rendering subsidies to producers in order to liberate production from the price system without altering private enterprise and profit. The Social Credit movement had a short-lived following in Britain in the 1920s and reached western Canada in the 1930s. In 1935 Aberhart’s newly established party won a majority of seats in Alberta’s provincial assembly, enabling it to form the world’s first Social Credit government. The party remained in power in Alberta until 1971. The movement spread from Alberta to other provinces, particularly British Columbia, where, except for the years 1972–75, it maintained power from 1952 to 1991. The party had less success at the national level, though it held seats in the House of Commons from 1935 to 1980. Thereafter, the party suffered internal conflict and was unable to win any seats in the federal Parliament. By the end of the 20th century, the party was also failing to win seats in any provincial assembly, including those of British Columbia and Alberta.
