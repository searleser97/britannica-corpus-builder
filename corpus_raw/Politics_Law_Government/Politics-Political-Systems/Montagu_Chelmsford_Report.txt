Montagu-Chelmsford Report,  set of recommendations made to the British Parliament in 1918 that became the theoretical basis for the Government of India Act of 1919. The report was the result of lengthy deliberations between Edwin Samuel Montagu, secretary of state for India (1917–22), and Lord Chelmsford, viceroy of India (1916–21). In August 1917 Montagu had informed the House of Commons that the policy of the British government toward India was thereafter to be one of “increasing association of Indians in every branch of the administration, with a view to the progressive realization of responsible government in India as an integral part of the empire.” Soon afterward Montagu headed a delegation that spent the winter of 1917–18 in India, during which he held his discussions with Chelmsford. The main element of the report was the recommendation that control over some aspects of provincial government be passed to Indian ministers responsible to an Indian electorate.
