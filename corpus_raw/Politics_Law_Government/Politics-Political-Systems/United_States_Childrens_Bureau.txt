United States Children’s Bureau,  U.S. federal agency established in 1912 to oversee and maintain national standards of child welfare.
As early as 1900, reformers such as Lillian Wald and Florence Kelley began calling for a federal agency to help the many American children dying in infancy from preventable illnesses, living in poverty in urban tenements and rural hovels, and working under terrible conditions in factories, mines, and fields. On April 9, 1912, President William Howard Taft signed into law legislation establishing a Children’s Bureau to “investigate and report…upon all matters pertaining to the welfare of children and child life among all classes of our people.” Originally housed within the Department of Commerce and Labor, the Children’s Bureau was transferred to the Department of Labor upon the latter’s creation in 1913. Presently located in the Department of Health and Human Services’ Administration for Children and Families, the bureau helps deliver services designed to protect children and strengthen families by providing grants to states, tribes, and communities. The child welfare services within its purview include adoption and foster care as well as the prevention of child abuse and neglect.
