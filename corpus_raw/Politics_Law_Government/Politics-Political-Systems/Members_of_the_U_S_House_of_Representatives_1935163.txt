 The House of Representatives is one of the two houses of the bicameral United States Congress, established in 1789 by the Constitution of the United States. It shares equal responsibility for lawmaking with the U.S. Senate. The allocation of seats is based on the population within the states, and membership is reapportioned every 10 years, following the decennial census. House members are elected for two-year terms from single-member districts of approximately equal population.
