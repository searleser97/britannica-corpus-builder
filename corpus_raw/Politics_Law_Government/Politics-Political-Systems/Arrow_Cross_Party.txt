Arrow Cross Party, Hungarian Nyilaskeresztes Párt,  Hungarian fascist organization that controlled the Hungarian government from October 1944 to April 1945 during World War II. It originated as the Party of National Will founded by Ferenc Szálasi in 1935. Szálasi’s party was quite small and underwent numerous reorganizations; it reconstituted itself under a new name and emerged early in 1939 as the Arrow Cross Party. In the May 1939 national elections it became the second most popular party, receiving about 30 seats in parliament.
After World War II broke out, however, the Hungarian prime minister Pál Teleki (served February 1939–April 1941) suppressed the Arrow Cross Party, imprisoning many of its adherents. When the Germans occupied Hungary and set up the collaborationist government of Döme Sztójay (March 1944), however, the Arrow Cross fortunes improved; the party received official approval from the new government and gained considerable popular support.
When the regent of Hungary, Admiral Miklós Horthy, began to seek a separate peace with the Allies (September 1944), the Germans decided to place Szálasi in power as prime minister (October 27), then as national leader (November 4). After the Soviet Union’s Red Army seized Budapest in February 1945, it drove the Germans and their Arrow Cross allies out of Hungary.
