Herodian,  one of a party of influential Jewish supporters of the Herodian dynasty (c. 55 bc–c. ad 93), which ruled in all or parts of Palestine and neighbouring areas. Noted in the New Testament as opponents of Jesus, they probably were not a political party or a religious sect. They probably favoured the policies of Herod Antipas, who was tetrarch of Galilee and Peraea (4 bc–ad 39) and a strong promoter of Hellenistic (Greco-Roman) culture in Palestine. It seems likely that they rejected the messianic hopes of the people and thus united with the Pharisees in attempts to entrap Jesus into making anti-Roman statements.
