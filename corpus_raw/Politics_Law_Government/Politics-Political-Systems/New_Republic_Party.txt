New Republic Party, Afrikaans Nuwe Republikeinse Party (NRP),  former South African political party founded in 1977 as the direct successor to the United Party.
The majority faction of the United Party, seeing its party disintegrating by defections to other new parties and to the ruling National Party, decided formally to disband the party on June 28, 1977. On the next day the group founded the New Republic Party. The new party then had a holdover of 23 seats in the House of Assembly; the next year, in the general elections, the representation dropped to 10 members. In the elections of 1981 the representation declined further, to eight seats. The partyâ€™s position as the major liberal opposition to the National Party had decisively been yielded to the Progressive Federal Party. In 1987 the party was reduced to one seat in Parliament, and it subsequently disbanded.
Generally liberal on nonracial questions, the New Republic Party favoured a new federation of races governed by a parliament controlled by whites but containing representatives from other racial groups.
