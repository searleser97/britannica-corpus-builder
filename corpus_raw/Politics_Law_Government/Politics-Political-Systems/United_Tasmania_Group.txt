United Tasmania Group (UTG),  Australian political party that was the world’s first green political party. The UTG was created on March 23, 1972, by protest groups opposed to the construction of a dam that was flooding Lake Pedder in the southwest of the Australian state of Tasmania.
The UTG ran candidates in unsuccessful bids for the Tasmanian state elections of 1972 and 1976. The group was relatively short-lived, disbanding on December 31, 1979, but its legacy is twofold. First, its founding charter, “The New Ethic,” identified principles—such as the principle that development should proceed only after considering the long-term benefits of conserving environmental and aesthetic resources—that have recurred in later international initiatives. Second, the UTG catalyzed the creation of new environmental groups, such as the Wilderness Society, in Australia and elsewhere and paved the way for later green political parties around the globe. The UTG re-formed for a short period in 1990 to run candidates in the federal election;  however, none were elected.
