Commonwealth,   a body politic founded on law for the common “weal,” or good. The term was often used by 17th-century writers, for example, Thomas Hobbes and John Locke, to signify the concept of the organized political community. For them it meant much the same as either civitas or res publica did for the Romans, or as “the state” means in the 20th century. Cicero defined the res publica as an association held together by law.
Specifically, commonwealth served as the label of the Cromwellian regime in Great Britain (1649–60). Modern usage has further extended the term. Thus, the Australian colonies were federated as states in 1900 under the official title of the Commonwealth of Australia. Then, as various British colonies evolved from a status subordinate to the United Kingdom into an association of equal partners, the new relationship was named a Commonwealth. After India became a republic and chose to remain inside the Commonwealth, the phrase “head of the Commonwealth” was substituted for “Emperor of India” in the royal title, and Queen Elizabeth II was so crowned in 1953.
In the United States, commonwealth has continued to be the official description of four states (Kentucky, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Virginia). It confers no distinction, other than in name, from the other states.
The same term also was applied to Puerto Rico after an act of Congress of 1950 and adoption of the constitution of 1952.
