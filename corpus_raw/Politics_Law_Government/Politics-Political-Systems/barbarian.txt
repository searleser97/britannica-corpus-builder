Barbarian,  word derived from the Greek bárbaros, used among the early Greeks to describe all foreigners, including the Romans. The word is probably onomatopoeic in origin, the “bar bar” sound representing the perception by Greeks of languages other than their own. Bárbaros soon assumed a deeply negative meaning, becoming associated with the vices and savage natures which the Greeks attributed to their enemies. The Romans adopted the word for all peoples other than those under Greco-Roman influence and domination. The name Barbary, once used to describe North Africa, is derived from the region’s Berber inhabitants, not from bárbaros.
