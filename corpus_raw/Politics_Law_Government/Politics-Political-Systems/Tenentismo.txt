Tenentismo,  (from Portuguese tenente, “lieutenant”), movement among young, idealistic Brazilian army officers, mostly from the lower-middle class, who pressed for social justice and national reforms in Brazil in the 1920s. On July 5, 1922, a number of the young officers raised the standard of revolt at the Igrejinha fortress in Copacabana. The uprising was quickly put down, and most of those who escaped the fortress (the Eighteen of Copacabana) were shot to death on the beach. One of the few survivors was Eduardo Gomes, who in 1945 and 1950 made unsuccessful attempts to become president.
In July 1924 another such revolt broke out in São Paulo; several weeks passed before federal troops were able to recapture the city. That October a force of about 1,000 rebels, led by a former army captain, Luís Carlos Prestes, began a two-year march through the Brazilian interior to demonstrate their demand for national reform. Successfully fighting off government troops, they went into exile once Washington Luís Pereira de Sousa became president in 1926.
After their exile the tenentes continued to exert their influence on Brazilian politics, as they played a major role in the 1930 revolution and the ensuing government of Getúlio Vargas. Later, one of their leaders, Juarez Tavora, was runner-up in the 1955 presidential elections, and a younger participant in the movement, Artur da Costa e Silva, served as Brazil’s president from 1967 to 1969.
