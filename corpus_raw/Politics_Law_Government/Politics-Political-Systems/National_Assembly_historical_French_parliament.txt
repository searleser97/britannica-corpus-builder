National Assembly, French Assemblée Nationale,  any of various historical French parliaments or houses of parliament. From June 17 to July 9, 1789, it was the name of the revolutionary assembly formed by representatives of the Third Estate; thereafter (until replaced by the Legislative Assembly on Sept. 30, 1791) its formal name was National Constituent Assembly (Assemblée Nationale Constituante), though popularly the shorter form persisted.
The name was not used again until the National Assembly of 1871–75, which concluded the Franco-German War and drafted the constitution of 1875. During the ensuing Third Republic (1875–1940), it was the joint name for the two houses of parliament, the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies. During the Fourth Republic (1946–58), it was the new name of the lower house alone (the former Chamber of Deputies)—the name of the upper house (the former Senate) being changed to the Council of the Republic. For the Fifth Republic (beginning in 1958), the name National Assembly was retained for the lower house, and the upper house reverted to the name of Senate.
Popularly, the name National Assembly has often been used when referring to any constituent assembly (assemblée constituante)—not only the National Constituent Assembly of the Revolution but also the Constituent Assembly of 1848 (which created the Second Republic) and the Constituent Assembly of 1945–46 (which created the Fourth Republic).
