Fidesz, byname of Federation of Young Democrats–Hungarian Civic Alliance, Hungarian Fiatal Demokraták Szövetsége–Magyar Polgári Szövetség,  centre-right Hungarian political party. Fidesz (the Federation of Young Democrats) was founded in 1988 as an anticommunist party that promoted the development of a market economy and European integration. Initially, membership was restricted to those age 35 and younger, though this restriction was eliminated in 1993. In 1995 the party appended the name Hungarian Civic Party to its shortened form (altered to Hungarian Civic Alliance in 2003).
Fidesz had its first notable success in 1990, when candidates associated with a coalition of which Fidesz was a member won mayoralties in a number of cities. In elections to the National Assembly that year, Fidesz won 22 seats. In 1997 members of a Christian Democratic group that had dissolved joined Fidesz in the National Assembly, enabling the joint group to form the largest bloc. The following year Fidesz became the single largest party in the National Assembly, winning 148 seats, and formed a coalition government with two other parties. Its leader, Viktor Orbán, became prime minister. Orbán’s government continued an austerity program, cut taxes and social insurance fees, and pursued Hungary’s membership in the European Union. The party was ousted from government following the 2002 elections.
After some eight years of Socialist rule, Fidesz, capitalizing on Hungary’s ongoing economic problems after the country’s economic collapse in 2008, swept back into power in the parliamentary elections of April 2010, winning more than two-thirds of the seats. Fidesz and its junior electoral coalition partner, the Christian Democratic People’s Party, repeated that feat in 2014 and again in 2018, with Orbán returning as prime minister each time.
