Shire,  in Great Britain, a county. The Anglo-Saxon shire (Old English scir) was an administrative division next above the hundred and seems to have existed in the south in the time of Alfred the Great (871–899) and to have been fully established by the reign of Edgar (959–975). It was administered by an ealdorman (alderman) and by a sheriff (i.e., shire-reeve), who presided over the shire court. After the Norman Conquest the French term county was introduced and generally supplanted shire in preferred official use, though shire continued in popular use and frequently even in official records and lasted in many county names such as Cheshire, Hampshire, and Warwickshire. The root shire is still also adjoined to the names of smaller communities such as the parish of Hexhamshire.
