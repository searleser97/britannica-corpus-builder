Liberty Party,  U.S. political party (1840–48) created by abolitionists who believed in political action to further antislavery goals. In opposition to William Lloyd Garrison and his followers (who scorned political activity as both futile and sinful in the battle to end slavery), a group of abolitionists met in Warsaw, New York, to organize the Liberty Party. They nominated James G. Birney, a Kentuckian and former slaveholder, for president. The party’s first national convention took place at Albany, New York, on April 1, 1840, when Birney’s nomination was confirmed.
Liberty Party supporters realized that the abolition of slavery in the South would not occur through political action. But they hoped to dramatize the antislavery issue, pressure legislators into taking firmer antislavery positions, prevent slavery from extending beyond the states where it existed into the federal territories, and eradicate both the interstate slave trade and the institution itself within the boundaries of the nation’s capital.
Although the Liberty Party collected only 7,000 votes in 1840, it raised that total to 62,000 in 1844 (when Birney was again its candidate), probably denying the state of New York—and with it the presidency—to Henry Clay. In January 1848 the party nominated John P. Hale at its convention in New York City. Hale withdrew from the race, and the Liberty Party dissolved when many of its members joined “Barnburner” Democrats and “Conscience” Whigs in forming the Free-Soil Party (August 9, 1848).
