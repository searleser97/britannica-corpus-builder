National Bloc, Arabic al-Kutlah al-Waṭaniyyah,  a coalition of Syrian nationalist parties that opposed the French mandate and demanded independence, dominating Syrian politics throughout the years of its existence, 1925–49.
The Bloc was a powerful minority in the first Constituent Assembly of 1928 and in the same year was instrumental in drawing up a strongly worded constitution that ignored France’s mandatory powers (and was subsequently rejected by the French high commissioner).
Popular support for the Bloc grew after the French dissolved the Assembly in 1930. Its insistent demands for independence forced the French to consider negotiations for a treaty in 1933, but no agreement could be reached. A Franco-Syrian treaty was finally signed in 1936, assuring Syrian independence and satisfying nationalist demands for the reinstatement of Druze and ʿAlawī districts in Syria proper. The Syrian government immediately ratified the treaty and the National Bloc assumed ministerial control. Less than three years later (February 1939), the National Bloc cabinet was forced to resign; it had antagonized the ʿAlawīs and Druzes to rebellion, allowed the French to hand over the Syrian sancak (district) of Alexandretta to Turkey, and was finally unable to force the French to ratify the 1936 treaty.
The Free French proclamation of an independent Syria in 1941 brought the National Bloc back to prominence and, led by Shukri al-Quwatli, it swept the elections in 1943. Its program pressed for the ejection of all French influence in Syria and the attainment of full independence. When the French left in 1945, however, the internal rivalries of the Bloc were exposed and new opposition parties began to form. For a while it maintained its majority in the government, but in March 1949, the last National Bloc cabinet and subsequently the party itself was ended by a coup led by Col. Ḥusnī al-Zaʿīm.
