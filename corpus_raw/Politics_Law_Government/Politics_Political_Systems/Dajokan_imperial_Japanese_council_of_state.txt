Dajōkan,  council of state of the Japanese imperial government during the Nara and Heian periods (710–857). Following the restoration of imperial power in 1868, the new government’s council of state was named after this ancient imperial institution. As reestablished, the Dajōkan was subdivided into an executive branch, a legislative branch, and six other departments. Reorganized several times, the Dajōkan was finally restructured on Sept. 13, 1871, into three chambers: a Left Chamber (Sa-in), the legislative body; a Right Chamber (U-in), which directed the various ministries; and a Central Chamber (Sei-in), which subsumed the powers of the other two chambers.
Though the Dajōkan’s autocratic structure was suited to the chaotic years immediately following the restoration, the government soon came under pressure to adopt a more parliamentary system. In 1885 the Dajōkan was abolished, and a Cabinet, responsible to the emperor, was created to replace it. Four years later, the first Japanese constitution was promulgated.
