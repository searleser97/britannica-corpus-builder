Liberal Party,   a minor U.S. political party in New York state, founded in May 1944 by leaders of the moderate wing of the American Labor Party in revolt against the alleged infiltration of that party by communists. Although the party has usually favoured candidates of the Democratic Party (its 329,000 votes helped carry New York state for President Franklin D. Roosevelt in its first electoral try in 1944), it has on occasion supported liberal Republicans, such as John V. Lindsay for mayor of New York City (successfully in 1965 and 1969) and Jacob K. Javits for reelection as U.S. senator (successfully in 1968 and 1974 and unsuccessfully in 1980). Although the Liberal Party has lacked a grand organization, it has managed at times to promote as many as 100 clubs, or chapters, in New York City, a committee-at-large, a trades-union council, a Spanish-speaking division, and a youth division.
