Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF),  left-wing political party prominent in Canada from the 1930s to the 1960s. Founded at Calgary, Alta., on Aug. 1, 1932, by a federation of various farmer, labour, and socialist parties in western Canada plus one labour union (the Canadian Brotherhood of Railway Employees), its avowed aim was to transform the capitalist economic system into a “cooperative commonwealth” by democratic means.
The Regina Manifesto, adopted at the party’s first annual convention at Regina, Sask., in 1933, was based on broad socialist principles. It called for economic planning on a national scale; socialization of banks and other financial institutions; and public ownership in transportation, communication, and natural resources.
In the period between 1933 and 1940, the federation’s influence spread to the other Canadian provinces, and it became the official opposition party in British Columbia, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, electing several members to the House of Commons. In 1944 it won the provincial general election in Saskatchewan and took over the government of that province. In subsequent years the CCF regime in Saskatchewan encouraged cooperative institutions; established state automobile and fire insurance; and socialized electric power, natural-gas distribution, and bus transportation.
Although the CCF continued to win provincial elections in Saskatchewan in 1948, 1952, 1956, and 1960, it declined elsewhere in Canada in the period from 1946 to 1961. In August 1961 the CCF was merged into the New Democratic Party.
