Coup of 18 Fructidor,  (Sept. 4, 1797), the purge of conservatives from the Corps Législatif and other posts during the Revolutionary period of the Directory in France.
The Directory, fearing that it was losing favour in the country, called upon Napoleon Bonaparte to send a general to command troops guarding the legislature at the Tuileries. On 18 Fructidor, year V (Sept. 4, 1797), Gen. Pierre-François-Charles Augereau, commanding the troops, purged more than 130 royalists and counterrevolutionaries from the Corps Législatif; and many deputies, journalists, nonjuring priests, and other individuals, including the director, the marquis de Barthélemy, were deported to Guiana in South America.
The royalists were thus once more thwarted—but the republican constitution itself was also fatally weakened. The coup still further confirmed the new power of the army and thus went far in preparing the way for the military despotism of Napoleon.
