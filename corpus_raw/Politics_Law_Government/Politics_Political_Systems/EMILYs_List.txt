EMILY’s List,  American political program and donor network dedicated to identifying and helping to elect to political office Democratic women candidates who favour the right of women to choose to have an abortion. The organization, founded in 1985, works with both state and federal candidates.
 EMILY is an acronym for “Early Money Is Like Yeast,” and one of the program’s chief activities is helping raise campaign funds for prochoice candidates. As well as providing funds from its members’ donations, EMILY’s List also supplies technical and strategic assistance to its candidates during their campaigns and devotes resources to getting Democratic women to the polls in support of its candidates. When the program began in 1985, the U.S. House of Representatives had only 12 Democratic women representatives and the Senate had none. By 1998 EMILY’s List claimed victory in helping elect to office 3 prochoice Democratic women governors, 7 U.S. senators, and 49 U.S. representatives.
