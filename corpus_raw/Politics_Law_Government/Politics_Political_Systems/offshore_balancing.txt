Offshore balancing,  theory of international relations that views multipolarity—when international relations are dominated by many superpowers—as an opportunity rather than as a threat. In the example of the United States during the early 21st century, proponents of offshore balancing believe that attempts to maintain U.S. hegemony as the world’s only superpower will lead other states to unite against the United States and ultimately reduce its relative power. According to this view, because the United States cannot stop the rise of new great powers, it should aim toward a strategy of burden shifting whereby others will take over responsibility for maintaining regional power balances and quelling problems.
To encourage cooperation in a multipolar world, the great powers would delineate spheres of influence and pledge noninterference in those regions. By pushing for burden shifting and spheres of influence, proponents of offshore balancing hoped to dampen the backlash against U.S. hegemony, especially after the launch of the war on terrorism and the Iraq War (2003–11).
