National Alliance, Italian Alleanza Nazionale, formerly (1946–94) Italian Social Movement or Italian Movimento Sociale Italiano (MSI),  former nationalist anticommunist political party of Italy. Historically, some of its members held neofascist views.
The MSI was formed in 1946 by supporters of former Italian leader Benito Mussolini from elements of the defunct Uomo Qualunque (Average Man) Party that had appeared in 1945. It first contested elections in 1948, when it won six seats in the Chamber of Deputies. From the 1950s to the early ’70s it averaged about 25 deputies. Moderates, initially worried about the MSI’s success, sometimes relied on MSI votes—which proved embarrassing; in 1960, for example, when the MSI formed a necessary part of a parliamentary majority, protest riots led to the fall of the Christian Democratic government. In the 1972 general elections MSI joined with another right-wing party, the Italian Democratic Party of Monarchical Unity, to form an alliance known as the National Right (Destra Nazionale; DN). In January 1973 they formally merged as the MSI-DN; but after a moderate faction bolted from the party in 1976, the party readopted its original name.
In the 1980s the party saw a resurgence. In 1983 it gained 42 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, and four years later it elected Gianfranco Fini as its leader. After support for the party dipped in the early 1990s, in 1994 it refashioned itself as the National Alliance. The following year the MSI was formally dissolved. The National Alliance joined two newly formed centre-right parties, the Forza Italia and the Northern League, in an alliance that was swept to power in parliamentary elections in March 1994, when the National Alliance captured 13.5 percent of the vote and was awarded six cabinet posts. Though the governing coalition was short-lived, the National Alliance saw its share of the vote increase to 16 percent in 1996.
From the mid-1990s Fini led the party in distancing itself from its fascist heritage. He supported economic liberalization, disowned previous statements he had made calling Mussolini the greatest statesman of the 20th century (a comment he had made in 1994), and referred to fascism as an “absolute evil.” In 2001 the National Alliance returned to government in a centre-right coalition led by Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. Fini was appointed deputy prime minister that year and foreign minister in 2004, but Berlusconi’s coalition fell from power in 2006. In 2007 the National Alliance joined with Berlusconi’s Forza Italia to create a new centre-right political grouping, the People of Freedom (Popolo della Libertà; PdL); PdL’s success in the 2008 parliamentary elections returned Berlusconi to power. The National Alliance formally merged with the Forza Italia in 2009, when the PdL became an official political party. In 2010, however, disagreements between Fini and Berlusconi led Fini and his supporters to defect from the PdL.
