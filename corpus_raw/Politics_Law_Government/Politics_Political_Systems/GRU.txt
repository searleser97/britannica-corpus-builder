GRU, abbreviation of Glavnoye Razvedyvatelnoye Upravlenie,  (Russian: Chief Intelligence Office), Soviet military intelligence organization. It had no formal connection to the KGB, the Soviet political police and security agency, though Western intelligence authorities believed that the KGB had agents within the GRU.
