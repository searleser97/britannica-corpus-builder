Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA),  public health agency of the U.S. Department of Labor. Formed in 1970 through the Occupational Safety and Health Act, OSHA is charged with ensuring that employers furnish their employees with a working environment free from recognized health and safety hazards.
OSHA has developed specific occupational safety and health standards to which employers are expected to comply. Such standards include fall protection for employees, prevention of exposure to infectious diseases and harmful chemicals, and provision of safety equipment, such as respirators. OSHA further develops regulations, conducts investigations and workplace inspections, and issues citations and penalties for noncompliance. OSHA also has a whistle-blower program to protect workers who file complaints about unsafe or unhealthful workplaces from retaliation by their employers.
OSHA is administered by the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health.
