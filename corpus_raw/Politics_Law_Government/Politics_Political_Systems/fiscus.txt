Fiscus, (Latin: “basket”, ) also called Purse,  the Roman emperor’s treasury (where money was stored in baskets), as opposed to the public treasury (aerarium). It drew money primarily from revenues of the imperial provinces, forfeited property, and the produce of unclaimed lands.
Vespasian created the fiscus Alexandrinus and fiscus Asiaticus to receive Egyptian and Asian revenues, formerly directed to the aerarium. The fiscus thereafter became independent of the aerarium and controlled most of the income of the empire. The fiscus supplied funds for the army and fleet, official salaries, and postal subsidies.
