Amban, (Manchu: “minister”)  Representative of China’s Qing emperor who lived in the territory of a tributary state or dependency. In 1793 the Qing emperor Qianlong changed the procedure for selecting the Dalai Lama, and the Tibetans had to persuade the amban that they had complied. In 1904, when the British were trying to force Tibet to sign a trade treaty, the amban said he was powerless to negotiate for the Tibetans, an admission that called into question the degree of control China exercised over Tibet. The ambans’ role and authority continues to be debated by the Chinese government and advocates of Tibetan independence in the attempt to support their conflicting claims for Tibet’s status.
