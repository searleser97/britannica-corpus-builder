Zemsky sobor,  (“assembly of the land”), in 16th- and 17th-century Russia, an advisory assembly convened by the tsar or the highest civil authority in power whenever necessary. It was generally composed of representatives from the ecclesiastical and monastic authorities, the boyar council, the landowning classes, and the urban freemen; elections for representatives and the sessions of each group were held separately.
Zemskie sobory were first called by Ivan IV the Terrible, and the assemblies met often during his reign; the most important one (1566) considered the Livonian War against Poland. After a zemsky sobor confirmed the accession of Fyodor I in 1584, none was called until the assembly that elected Boris Godunov tsar in 1598. During the Time of Troubles (1598–1613), the assemblies were again convened frequently and were highly influential; the zemsky sobor that assembled in 1613 elected Michael Romanov tsar. Several others subsequently assisted with internal reforms, but after 1622 the zemsky sobor declined in importance; the last one was convened in 1653.
In the 19th century the Slavophiles revived the concept of the zemsky sobor, considering it a reflection of the ideal union between the tsar and the Russian people; a proposal to reestablish the institution resulted in the dismissal of the minister who suggested it, N.P. Ignatiev.
