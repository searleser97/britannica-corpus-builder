Israel,  either of two political units in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament): the united kingdom of Israel under the kings Saul, David, and Solomon, which lasted from about 1020 to 922 bce; or the northern kingdom of Israel, including the territories of the 10 northern tribes (i.e., all except Judah and part of Benjamin), which was established in 922 bce as the result of a revolt led by Jeroboam I. The southern kingdom, ruled by the Davidic dynasty, was thereafter referred to as Judah. The later kingdom’s history was one of dynastic instability, with only two prolonged periods of stable government, under Omri (reigned 876–869 or c. 884–c. 872 bce) and Ahab (c. 874–c. 853 bce) and the Jehu dynasty (c. 842–746 bce). In the 8th century bce the northern kingdom was overrun by the Neo-Assyrian empire, with Samaria, the capital, falling in 722/721.
