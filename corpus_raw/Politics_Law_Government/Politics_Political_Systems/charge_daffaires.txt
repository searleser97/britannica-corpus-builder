Chargé d’affaires,   the lowest rank of diplomatic representative recognized under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (1961). A chargé d’affaires is usually accredited to the foreign minister of the country in which he operates, rather than to the head of state, and acts in the absence of the head of his mission—usually an ambassador. A chargé d’affaires may be appointed head of mission in cases in which only tenuous diplomatic relations exist between his country and the receiving state.
