Americans for Democratic Action (ADA),  a liberal independent political organization in the United States. It was formed in 1947 by a group of labour leaders, civic and political leaders, and academics who were liberal in their views on national affairs, internationalist in world outlook, and anticommunist in conviction. The ADA is devoted to the propagation of liberal ideas, the election of liberal public officials, and the passage of liberal legislation. The ADA reached the height of its influence after John F. Kennedy’s election to the presidency in 1960, when a number of ADA leaders and members were appointed to key positions in his administration. The ADA supported the domestic legislative agenda of Kennedy’s successor, Lyndon B. Johnson, but broke with him over the issue of American involvement in the Vietnam War, which the ADA opposed. The ADA has traditionally cultivated close ties with elements of the Democratic Party. It is headquartered in Washington, D.C.
