 Mexicoâ€™s constitution of 1917 established economic and political principles for the country, including the role of its president. The president today is popularly elected to a single six-year term and has the power to select a cabinet, the attorney general, diplomats, high-ranking military officers, and Supreme Court justices (who serve life terms). The president also has the right to issue reglamentos (executive decrees) that have the effect of law. This is a chronologically ordered list of the presidents, from the earliest to the most recent.
