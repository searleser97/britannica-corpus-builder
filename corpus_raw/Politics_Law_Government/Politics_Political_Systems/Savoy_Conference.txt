Savoy Conference,   meeting held in 1661 at the Savoy Palace, London, attended by 12 Anglican bishops and 12 Puritan ministers, with nine assistants from each side, in order to decide on revisions for The Book of Common Prayer; as a result of the conference, the majority of Puritans defected from the Church of England.
The bishops, led by Gilbert Sheldon, ignored the Reformed liturgy presented by Richard Baxter, a Presbyterian, and refused to consider most of the “Exceptions”—a list of Puritan objections to The Book of Common Prayer. The bishops also required the reordination of ministers who had not received orders from a bishop. The following year a revision of The Book of Common Prayer incorporated a few minor “Exceptions,” but it proved equally unacceptable to the Puritans.
