National Liberal Party, German Nationalliberale Partei,  political party that was active first in Prussia and the North German Confederation from 1867, then in Germany in 1871–1918. With largely middle-class support, the National Liberals hoped to make the government under Chancellor Otto von Bismarck less autocratic. Originally a moderate section of the old Prussian Liberals, the nucleus of the National Liberals broke from that party in 1867 in support of Bismarck’s drive to unite Germany under Prussia.
From 1871 until 1879 the National Liberals, under the leadership of Rudolf von Bennigsen and Johannes von Miquel, supported Bismarck enthusiastically in the Reichstag (parliament) and constituted a virtual government party, winning more seats than any other party. Conflict with Bismarck arose in the years 1877–79 because of National Liberal demands for a parliamentary ministry. This discord was exacerbated by disagreement over taxes when the National Liberals wanted to give the Reichstag control over revenues. The party split over this issue in 1880 after losing many seats in the election of 1879. After 1890 the National Liberals were often divided on social and economic issues, and their share of the vote declined.
