Constituent Assembly, Russian Uchreditelnoye Sobraniye,  popularly elected body that convened in 1918 in Petrograd (St. Petersburg) to write a constitution and form a government for postrevolutionary Russia. The assembly was dissolved by the Bolshevik government.
The election of the Constituent Assembly was held on Nov. 25, 1917 (November 12, Old Style). The Socialist Revolutionary Party, though only receiving a plurality of the vote (40 percent), won a majority of the seats. The Bolsheviks received a little less than 25 percent of the vote. Other parties won only a small number of delegates.
The Bolsheviks and their allies, the Left Socialist Revolutionaries, argued that this mandate was not valid and that the Soviets (where they were in control) more accurately reflected the public will.
When the Constituent Assembly convened on Jan. 18, 1918 (January 5, Old Style), it rejected the Bolsheviksâ€™ demand that it recognize the authority of the Soviet government. The Bolshevik delegates (and the Left Socialist Revolutionaries as well) walked out. The next day, troops loyal to the Soviet government dispersed representatives of the non-Bolshevik parties, and the government officially dissolved the Assembly.
