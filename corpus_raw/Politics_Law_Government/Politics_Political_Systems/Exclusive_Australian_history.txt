Exclusive, also called Exclusionist,  in Australian history, member of the sociopolitical faction of free settlers, officials, and military officers of the convict colony of New South Wales, formed in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The Exclusives sought to exclude Emancipists (former convicts) from full civil rights. Governor Lachlan Macquarie (1810â€“21) tried to introduce notable Emancipists into the social and political life of the colony, but he was opposed by the Exclusives. Immediately thereafter, imperial policy supported the Exclusionist position. By the 1830s, however, a class of lesser settlers joined with the Emancipists in calling for self-rule for the colony on a broadly representative basis. The Exclusives, who also favoured self-rule, countered this effort by petitioning the home government for a restrictive constitution that would bar Emancipists from political participation. The constitution granted to the colony in 1842 embodied the more democratic scheme, however, and the Exclusive position crumbled.
