Mir,   in Russian history, a self-governing community of peasant households that elected its own officials and controlled local forests, fisheries, hunting grounds, and vacant lands. To make taxes imposed on its members more equitable, the mir assumed communal control of the community’s arable land and periodically redistributed it among the households, according to their sizes (from 1720).
After serfdom was abolished (1861), the mir was retained as a system of communal land tenure and an organ of local administration. It was economically inefficient; but the central government, having made members of the commune collectively responsible for the payment of state taxes and the fulfillment of local obligations, favoured it. The system was also favoured by Slavophiles and political conservatives, who regarded it as a guardian of old national values, as well as by revolutionary Narodniki (“Populists”), who viewed the mir as the germ of a future socialist society. Despite the efforts of Prime Minister Pyotr A. Stolypin, who initiated a series of agricultural reforms encouraging peasants to assume private ownership, the peasantry universally reverted to communal landholding after the 1917 Revolution.
