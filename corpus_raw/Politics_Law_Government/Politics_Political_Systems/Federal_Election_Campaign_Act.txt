Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA),  legislation adopted in the United States in 1971 to regulate the raising and spending of money in U.S. federal elections. It imposed restrictions on the amounts of monetary or other contributions that could lawfully be made to federal candidates and parties, and it mandated disclosure of contributions and expenditures in campaigns for federal office. The Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) also introduced outright bans on certain corporate and union contributions, speech, and expenditures.
FECA has been amended several times: in 1974 following the Watergate scandal, in 1976 after the Supreme Court struck down several provisions as unconstitutional in Buckley v. Valeo, and in 2002 by the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA). The BCRA went into effect immediately following the 2002 elections and governed all U.S. federal elections until the Supreme Court’s decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010), which invalidated the BCRA’s restrictions on corporate and union spending on independent political advertising. In McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission (2014), the Supreme Court struck down FECA amendments, including by the BCRA, that had imposed aggregate limits on individual contributions to multiple federal candidates, political parties, and political action committees (PACs).
