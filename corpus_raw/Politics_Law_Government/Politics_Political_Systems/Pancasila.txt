Pancasila, also spelled Pantjasila, English Five Principles,  the Indonesian state philosophy, formulated by the Indonesian nationalist leader Sukarno. It was first articulated on June 1, 1945, in a speech delivered by Sukarno to the preparatory committee for Indonesia’s independence, which was sponsored by the Japanese during their World War II occupation. Sukarno argued that the future Indonesian state should be based on the Five Principles: Indonesian nationalism; internationalism, or humanism; consent, or democracy; social prosperity; and belief in one God. The statement was not well received by the Japanese authorities, but independence preparations for Indonesia were continued. Before Indonesia’s independence was declared, however, the Japanese had surrendered and Britain had taken control of the country.
The Five Principles have since become the blueprint of the Indonesian nation. In the constitution of the Republic of Indonesia promulgated in 1945, the Five Principles were listed in a slightly different order and in different words: the belief in one God, just and civilized humanity, Indonesian unity, democracy under the wise guidance of representative consultations, and social justice for all the peoples of Indonesia.
