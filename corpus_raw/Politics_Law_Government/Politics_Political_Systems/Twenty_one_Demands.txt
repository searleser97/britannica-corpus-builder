Twenty-one Demands,  (Jan. 18, 1915), claims made by the Japanese government to special privileges in China during World War I. The major European powers, which already enjoyed similar privileges in China, could not oppose Japan’s move because of their involvement in the war. On May 7 Japan delivered an ultimatum, to which the Chinese president, Yuan Shikai, capitulated by signing a series of Sino-Japanese agreements on May 25.
The demands called for confirmation of Japan’s railway and mining claims in Shandong province; granting of special concessions in Manchuria; Sino-Japanese control of the Han-Ye-Ping mining base in central China; access to harbours, bays, and islands along China’s coast; and Japanese control, through advisers, of Chinese financial, political, and police affairs. Yuan’s forced acceptance of all but the last point greatly increased anti-Japanese feeling in China.
