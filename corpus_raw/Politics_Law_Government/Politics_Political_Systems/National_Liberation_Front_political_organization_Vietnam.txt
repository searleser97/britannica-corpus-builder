National Liberation Front (NLF), formally National Front for the Liberation of the South, Vietnamese Mat-Tran Dan-Toc Giai-Phong Mien-Nam,  Vietnamese political organization formed on December 20, 1960, to effect the overthrow of the South Vietnamese government and the reunification of North and South Vietnam. An overtly communist party was established in 1962 as a central component of the NLF, but both the military arm, the Viet Cong, and the political organization of the NLF included many noncommunists. The NLF was represented by its own diplomatic staffs in all communist countries and in several neutral countries.
Unlike the Viet Minh (anti-French guerrilla force, many members of which became part of the Viet Cong), the NLF did not establish a provisional government until June 1969, when the Provisional Revolutionary Government (PRG) of South Vietnam was announced. With the reunification of Vietnam in 1976, the NLF joined the Vietnamese Communist Party and the other political organizations in forming a National United Front.
