Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS),  agency of the Indian government established in 1987 to devise uniform standards of quality for broad categories of manufactured and agricultural goods, to perform product testing, and to license the use of an official mark to indicate that a product has been certified as conforming to BIS standards. In 1991, under a special scheme instituted that year, the BIS also began licensing a special mark for environmentally friendly products. Certification by the BIS is mandatory for certain classes of products—such as milk powder, X-ray equipment, and gas cylinders—that directly affect public health and safety. In other cases, voluntary, or optional, certification or self-certification by the manufacturer may be permitted.
The BIS is the successor of the Indian Standards Institution (ISI), which was created in 1947 to ensure quality control and competitive efficiency in the rapid industrialization expected in the early decades of India’s independence. The BIS employs a large staff of engineers, scientists, and statisticians; testing is carried out in its own laboratories as well as in independent facilities that demonstrate compliance with laboratory guidelines established by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The agency is headquartered in New Delhi and maintains regional and branch offices throughout the country.
