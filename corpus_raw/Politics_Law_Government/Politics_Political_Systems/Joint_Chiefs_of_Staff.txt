Joint Chiefs of Staff,  panel of high-ranking U.S. military officers who advise the president of the United States and other civilian leaders on military issues. As an advisory body, the Joint Chiefs of Staff do not lead combat forces and have no executive or command authority over troops in their services.
The Joint Chiefs of Staff comprise the heads of the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps. That body of four-star generals is led by another four-star general, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who serves as the chief military adviser to the president, secretary of defense and National Security Council. A vice chairman, who is also a four-star general, assists the chairman and performs the chairmanâ€™s duties in his absence. The chairman has three assistants: one who focuses on international relations and political-military affairs, one for National Guard matters, and another for reserve forces. A group of staff officers, called the Joint Staff, also assist the chairman and the other members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff with their primary duties. The Joint Staff is composed of approximately equal numbers of officers from the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines.
The Joint Chiefs of Staff originated in World War II, when U.S. military leaders recognized the need for an overall command to coordinate the efforts of the various services. A unified high-command structure was adopted in 1942 and maintained on an informal basis throughout the war. The Joint Chiefs of Staff were formally established as an advisory body by the National Security Act of 1947, and a 1953 amendment to that act prohibited the body from exercising command authority.
