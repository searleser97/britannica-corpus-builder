Croatian Peasant Party,   dominant political party in Croatia during the first half of the 20th century. Founded in 1904 by Stjepan Radić (and his brother Ante Radić), it advocated home rule for a Croatia dominated by peasants on homesteads increased by redistribution of land. The party formed the almost constant opposition to the Serbian-dominated government of Yugoslavia after the foundation of the kingdom in 1918. The assassination of Radić in 1928 precipitated the assumption of state power by King Alexander I in 1929. Led thenceforth by Vladimir Maček, the party opposed the royal dictatorship and the succeeding regency (1935–41) until 1939, when it accepted control of an autonomous Croatia and participated in the new central government of Yugoslavia. In 1935 the party created the peasant cooperative Gospodarska Sloga. Elements of the party joined the World War II Partisan movement in resisting the Nazi occupation. The party was submerged in the communization of Yugoslavia, beginning in 1945.
