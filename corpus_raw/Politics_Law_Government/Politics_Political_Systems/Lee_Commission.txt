Lee Commission,  body appointed by the British government in 1923 to consider the ethnic composition of the superior Indian public services of the government of India. The chairman was Lord Lee of Fareham, and there were equal numbers of Indian and British members. The Islington Commissionâ€™s report (1917) had recommended that 25 percent of the higher government posts should go to Indians. That report had become a dead letter in 1918, when the Montagu-Chelmsford Report proposed Indian appointments to one-third of the posts. Simultaneous examinations were instituted in London and New Delhi in 1922. But by this time, because of political uncertainties, there was a shortage of British entrants.
The Lee Commission proposed in 1924 that 40 percent of future entrants should be British, 40 percent Indians directly recruited, and 20 percent Indians promoted from the provincial service. By the date of independence in 1947, more than half the service of about 1,000 members were Indians, many with long experience and holding high positions.
