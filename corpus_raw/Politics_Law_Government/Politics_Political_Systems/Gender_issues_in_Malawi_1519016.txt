In Malawi, the male-female ratio in schools, universities, and higher positions in public service and industry generally favours the male gender. In the past, parents assumed that the destiny of daughters was to get married, have children, and serve their husbands and society. Although such attitudes are changing rapidly, they partly explain why the gender imbalance exists. Matters concerning family planning were considered to be too sensitive to most Malawians, and government was reluctant to intervene in spite of the growing population. Women, many of whom not only raised children but also tended food crops to support their families—in some cases without the assistance of their husbands—often bore the greater burden. The situation began to change slowly after independence, as even the conservative Pres. Hastings Kamuzu Banda (1963–94) extolled the virtues of education for all. In the mid-1980s the government started the Child Spacing Program (from 1994, the Malawi Family Planning Program). Although it did not specifically mention birth control, the program sought to educate women in this area and even made available various planning methods free of charge.
Further measures have been taken since that time. The National Gender Policy aims to raise awareness of gender matters, legal rights of women, diet and the efficient utilization of food and nutrition, and the economic empowerment of women in conjunction with the poverty alleviation program. Another important aspect of the National Gender Policy is better access to reproductive health services for women, which involves making family planning and other health facilities available to women in all parts of the country.
