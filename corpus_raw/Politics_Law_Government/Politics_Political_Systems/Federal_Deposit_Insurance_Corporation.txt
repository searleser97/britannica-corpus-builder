Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC),  independent U.S. government corporation created under authority of the Banking Act of 1933 (also known as the Glass-Steagall Act), with the responsibility to insure bank deposits in eligible banks against loss in the event of a bank failure and to regulate certain banking practices. It was established after the collapse of many American banks during the initial years of the Great Depression. Although earlier state-sponsored plans to insure depositors had not succeeded, the FDIC became a permanent government agency through the Banking Act of 1935.
The FDIC’s income is derived from assessments on insured banks and from investments. Insured banks are assessed on the basis of their average deposits; they are currently allowed pro-rata credits totaling two-thirds of the annual assessments after deductions for losses and corporation expenses. The corporation is authorized to insure bank deposits in eligible banks up to a specified maximum amount that has been adjusted through the years. Having begun in 1934 with deposit insurance of $5,000 per account, in 1980 the FDIC raised that amount to $100,000 for each deposit. The limit was later temporarily (2008) and then permanently (2010) raised to $250,000.
From 1933, all members of the Federal Reserve System were required to insure their deposits, while nonmember banks—about half the United States total—were allowed to do so if they met FDIC standards. Almost all incorporated commercial banks in the United States participate in the plan. The FDIC is managed by a board of five directors who are appointed by the U.S. president; the five board positions are chairman, vice chairman, director, comptroller of the currency, and director of the Office of Thrift Supervision.
