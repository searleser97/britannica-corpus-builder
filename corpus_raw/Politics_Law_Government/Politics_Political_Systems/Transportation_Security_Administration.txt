Transportation Security Administration (TSA),  U.S. agency created following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks that is mandated with developing and implementing policies to ensure the safety of the nation’s transportation systems. It was established by the Aviation and Transportation Security Act, which was passed by Congress and signed into law by Pres. George W. Bush on November 19, 2001. Originally part of the U.S. Department of Transportation, in 2003 the TSA became part of the newly created Department of Homeland Security.
Airport security and preventing aircraft hijacking are important concerns of the TSA and arguably the most well-known to the public. Uniformed transportation security officers at airports examine passengers and luggage, looking for any prohibited materials. Others work behind the scenes, for example, by reviewing passenger lists and comparing them with lists of individuals deemed to be a security threat or at risk for being a security threat. They then identify anyone who requires additional screening or who should not be allowed to board a plane.
The TSA also has a public presence with its VIPR teams (Visible Intermodal Prevention and Response teams), members of which are easily identifiable as security officers and who patrol railways and mass transit systems. Other modes of transportation that are also under the purview of the TSA include freight carriers moving across the nation’s highways, cargo entering U.S. ports and traveling on U.S. waterways, and freight transported via pipelines.
In addition to the transportation security officers and VIPR members mentioned above, the TSA also employs other specialists, including behavior detection officers, federal air marshals, explosives specialists, and canine teams as part of its mandate to keep the country’s transportation systems safe.
