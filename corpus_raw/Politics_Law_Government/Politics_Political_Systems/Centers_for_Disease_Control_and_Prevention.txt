Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),  agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, headquartered in Atlanta, whose mission is centred on preventing and controlling disease and promoting environmental health and health education in the United States. Part of the Public Health Service, it was founded in 1946 as the Communicable Disease Center to fight malaria and other infectious diseases. As its scope widened to polio, smallpox, and disease surveillance, the name was changed to the Center for Disease Control and later pluralized.
Today the CDC subsumes health statistics, infectious diseases, and environmental health; a National Immunization Program; and an Office on Smoking and Health. It consolidates disease-control data, health promotion, disease prevention and preparedness, and public health programs, and it provides grants for studies and programs, health information to health care professionals and the public, and publications on epidemiology. It is among the worldâ€™s foremost epidemiological centres.
