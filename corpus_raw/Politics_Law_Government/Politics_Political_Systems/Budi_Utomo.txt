Budi Utomo, (Indonesian: “Noble Endeavour”)  the first Indonesian nationalist organization. It was founded on May 20, 1908, a day now designated by the Indonesian government as the Day of National Awakening. 
Budi Utomo originated through the efforts of Mas Wahidin Sudirohusodo (1852–1917), a retired Javanese physician who, attempting to elevate the Javanese people through the study of Western knowledge as well as their own cultural heritage, sought to obtain support for a scholarship fund for Indonesian students. His efforts were supported by Dutch-educated Javanese students in Batavia (now Jakarta) and later by Javanese aristocrats and priyayi (elite). They met in Yogyakarta in 1908 and founded Budi Utomo, which aimed at improving the cultural and economic status of the Javanese. 
As a Javanese cultural organization, Budi Utomo grew rapidly, and by the end of 1909 it claimed to have 40 branches with 10,000 members, most of them students and civil servants. Their expressed objectives went far beyond Wahidin’s interest in improving educational opportunities for Indonesians; they called for the encouragement of agriculture and trade and the dissemination of humanistic thought. However much its members emphasized Javanese culture, Budi Utomo assumed that progress meant adopting the social and political institutions of the West. The leadership was held by conservatives who resisted political activity by the group, but they were increasingly opposed by younger and more aggressive members. The effectiveness of Budi Utomo was finally undercut by the appeal of those who favoured direct action against the West and by more radical and expressly political organizations such as the Sarekat Islām, a proto-nationalist party. Membership in Budi Utomo fell off sharply after 1910, but the organization was important as a model for later nationalist groups. It was dissolved in 1935.
