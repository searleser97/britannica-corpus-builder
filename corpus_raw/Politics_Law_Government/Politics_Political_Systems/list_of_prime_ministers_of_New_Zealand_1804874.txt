 New Zealand has a parliamentary form of government based on the British model. The head of government is the prime minister, generally the leader of the governing political party in Parliament. The titles premier and first minister were variously applied to each of the principal ministers until 1869, when premier became customary. Although the title prime minister was first used formally in the Schedule of the Civil List Act of 1873, no one used the title officially until Richard John Seddon, beginning in 1893. This is a chronologically ordered list of the prime ministers—including premiers and first ministers—from the earliest to the most recent.
