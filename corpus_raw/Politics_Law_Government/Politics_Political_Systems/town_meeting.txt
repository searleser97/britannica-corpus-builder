Town meeting,   in the United States, an assembly of local qualified voters in whom is vested the governmental authority of a town. Town meetings are a particularly popular form of governmental administration in New England, where a town is a geographic unit, the equivalent of a civil township elsewhere. In New England, towns are granted powers that are granted only to counties elsewhere, as well as their ordinary municipal powers. County government is therefore comparatively insignificant.
At the meetings, which may be held periodically or on demand, officials and school boards may be elected or chosen to govern between meetings; ordinances may be adopted; and taxes and expenditures may be debated and voted upon. Because of the extraordinary autonomy granted each town, New England state legislatures end up being among the largest in the United States.
