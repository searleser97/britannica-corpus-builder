Movement Toward Socialism (MAS), Spanish Movimiento al Socialismo,  leftist Venezuelan political party.
The MAS was formed in 1971 following a split the previous year in the Venezuelan Communist Party over the dismissal of its leader, Teodoro Petkoff, for remarks criticizing the Soviet Union’s invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 and his rejection of Eurocommunism and the Soviet model. The MAS quickly won the support of most members of the Communist Party and a majority of communist trade union leaders. In the elections of 1973 it emerged as the most successful of Venezuela’s leftist parties, but the party suffered in the 1980s from a split between the supporters of Petkoff and those of José Vicente Rangel. In 1993 the MAS joined an electoral alliance with the National Convergence Party, which enabled Rafael Caldera to win the presidency. In 1996, however, it formed a coalition in the legislature with the anti-Caldera forces.
The MAS is headed by a party president and a general secretary, both of whom head an Executive Committee and a National Directorate. Below the national institutions, there are regional and local parties, which exercise considerable autonomy. The existence of numerous internal factions dilutes the party’s ideological coherence. Its unity has also been undermined by allegations of fraud in internal elections in the 1990s. The MAS has generally supported greater protection for workers by the state and the elimination of state-development programs. The party, which has about 400,000 members, is particularly strong among intellectuals and trade unionists in urban areas.
