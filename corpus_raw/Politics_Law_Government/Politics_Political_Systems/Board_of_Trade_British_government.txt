Board of Trade, also called Lords Commissioners of Trade and Plantations,  English governmental advisory body established by William III in May 1696 to replace the Lords of Trade (1675) in the supervision of colonial affairs. The board was to examine colonial legislation and to recommend disallowance of those laws that conflicted with imperial trade policies, to nominate governors and other high officials for royal colonies and to write the instructions for appointed governors, to recommend laws affecting the colonies to Parliament and the Privy Council, and to hear and to make reports on complaints from the colonies regarding imperial administration. These responsibilities were more extensive than those that had been delegated to the Lords of Trade. Memberships in the Board of Trade consisted of two groups: eight permanent salaried commissioners who conducted the regular duties of the board and eight ex-officio unpaid members who were nominally selected from the Privy Council.
The board itself lacked executive or legislative powers but it became in effect the primary policy-making and administrative agency of the British government in its mercantilist endeavours to make the American colonies profitable to the mother country. The Board of Trade continued to manage colonial affairs until 1779 and was abolished three years later.
