Gehlen had headed the Foreign Armies East section of the Abwehr, the intelligence service of the German general staff. He directed the BND until 1968, when he was succeeded by General Gerhard Wessel, a noted specialist on Soviet affairs and organizations. The BND reported to the West German chancellor. Its divisions were concerned with subversion, counterintelligence, and foreign intelligence, and it was headquartered at Munich, West Germany. In addition to foreign intelligence the BND engaged in communications intelligence and exchanged information with the intelligence services of NATO and other friendly countries.
