Collective security,  system by which states have attempted to prevent or stop wars. Under a collective security arrangement, an aggressor against any one state is considered an aggressor against all other states, which act together to repel the aggressor.
Collective security arrangements have always been conceived as being global in scope; this is in fact a defining characteristic, distinguishing them from regional alliances such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Both the League of Nations and the United Nations were founded on the principle of collective security.
Neither the League nor the United Nations were able to operate the principle successfully to prevent aggression because of the conflicts of interest among states, especially among the major powers. The existence of such conflicts has in fact been recognized in the institutionalized arrangements of the two world bodies themselves: under the Covenant of the League of Nations the response to aggression was left to the member states to decide (article 16, paragraph 3, as amended by interpretive resolutions adopted in 1921); and under the UN Charter any permanent member of the Security Council may veto collective action (article 27, paragraph 3).
