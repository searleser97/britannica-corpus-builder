Zemstvo,  organ of rural self-government in the Russian Empire and Ukraine; established in 1864 to provide social and economic services, it became a significant liberal influence within imperial Russia. Zemstvos existed on two levels, the uyezd (canton) and the province; the uyezd assemblies, composed of delegates representing the individual landed proprietors and the peasant village communes, elected the provincial assemblies. Each assembly appointed an executive board and hired professional experts to carry out its functions.
Generally dominated by the nobility, the zemstvos suffered after 1890 from legislation that restricted their authority, from insufficient revenue, and from administrative controls of a hostile bureaucracy. Nevertheless, they expanded the network of elementary schools, constructed roads, provided health care, and instructed the peasantry in agricultural techniques. From the late 1890s onward they also agitated for constitutional reform and, through a union organized by the zemstvos and their professional employees, stimulated revolutionary activity in 1904â€“05 and 1917. Reorganized on a democratic basis in 1917, the zemstvos were abolished after the Bolshevik party came to power later that year.
The term zemstvo also referred to a 16th-century institution for tax collection.
