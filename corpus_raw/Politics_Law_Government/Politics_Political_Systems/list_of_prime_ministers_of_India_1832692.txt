 India’s head of state is the president, whose powers are largely nominal and ceremonial. Effective executive power rests with the Council of Ministers, headed by the prime minister, who is chosen by the majority party or coalition in the Lok Sabha (lower house of parliament) and is formally appointed by the president. This is a chronologically ordered list of the prime ministers, from the earliest to the most recent.
