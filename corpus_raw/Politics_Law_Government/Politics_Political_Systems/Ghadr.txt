Ghadr,   (Urdu: “Revolution”), an early 20th-century movement among Indians, principally Sikhs living in North America, to end British rule in their homeland of India. The movement originated with an organization of immigrants in California called the Hindustani Workers of the Pacific Coast. Shortly after the outbreak of World War I, many of the Ghadrites returned to India and for several months during 1915 carried on terrorist activities in central Punjab. Attempted uprisings were quickly crushed by the British. After the war, the party in America split into Communist and anti-Communist factions. The party was dissolved in 1948, after India had achieved independence.
