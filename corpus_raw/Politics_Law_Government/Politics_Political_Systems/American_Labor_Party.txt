American Labor Party,   (ALP), minor U.S. political party that was based in New York state. The ALP was organized in 1936 by the labour leaders Sidney Hillman and David Dubinsky and by liberal Democrats and old-line Socialists, and it had strong ties with labour unions. The party supported President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal and threw its support to those Democratic or Republican candidates who endorsed liberal social legislation. The party polled more than 270,000 votes for Roosevelt in the 1936 presidential election, and it helped reelect Fiorello La Guardia as mayor of New York City in 1937. It also endorsed Roosevelt for president in 1940 and 1944.
From the start there were factional fights between the left and moderate wings of the ALP. Communists had infiltrated the party, and at its convention in 1940 they rioted against the endorsement of Roosevelt. When the Communists gained control of the party in the primary of 1944, Dubinsky and others of the party’s founders withdrew and organized the Liberal Party. The ALP supported the candidacy of Henry A. Wallace for president in 1948 and polled more than 500,000 votes for him, but its support of Wallace drove more voters from the party’s ranks. The New York state committee of the ALP voted to dissolve the party after 20 years of existence; it was unable to reconcile the personal and political differences within its ranks.
