Silhak, also spelled Sirhak,   (Korean: “Practical Learning”), school of thought that came into existence in the midst of the chaotic conditions of 18th-century Korea, dedicated to a practical approach to statecraft, instead of the blind and uncritical following of Confucian teachings.
The Silhak school attacked Neo-Confucianism, particularly its formalism and concern with ritual. Members of the school originated many ideas for social reform, especially for land reform and the development of farming. Several important books on these subjects were written that give a good picture of farming practices in the 17th and 18th centuries.
The greatest contribution to the Silhak school came from Yi Ik (1681–1763) and Pak Chi-won (1737–1805). Yi’s concern was largely with such matters as land reform, farming, and the abolition of class barriers and slavery. Pak advocated the development of commerce and technology.
With the introduction of Western culture in the late 19th century, Silhak, along with Sŏhak (q.v.), or Western Learning, contributed to the development and spread of ideas that stimulated the gradual modernization of Korea.
