Christian Social Union (CSU), German Christlich-Soziale Union,  conservative German political party that was founded in Bavaria, Germany, in 1946 by various Roman Catholic and Protestant groups and is committed to free enterprise, federalism, and a united Europe operating under Christian principles.
Since December 1946, when party leader Josef Müller guided the CSU to an overall majority in that year’s Land (state) elections, the CSU has governed Bavaria continuously with only one exception (1954–57), though until 1962 it was sometimes forced to form a coalition with other parties. In national elections it consistently performed well—averaging more than half of the votes in Bavaria—into the 21st century. In 2008, however, having suffered its worst state election results since 1954, it lost its long-standing absolute majority in the state. In Germany’s parliamentary elections in 2009, the CSU, continuing to falter, garnered the smallest percentage of the Bavarian vote (42.6 percent) since 1949. In September 2013, however, the CSU regained its absolute majority in the Bavarian parliament one week before it and its alliance partner, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), won the federal parliamentary election by capturing nearly 42 percent of the vote. The CSU is the Bavarian affiliate of the CDU; although the CSU has its own leadership, organization, and fund-raising structures, it does not run candidates outside Bavaria. In turn, the CDU does not compete in Bavaria. In parliament the two parties maintain a common caucus (Fraktion), with cochairmen representing each party.
From 1961 to 1988 the CSU was led by Franz Josef Strauss, who served as a member of the Bundestag, the lower house of the national legislature, from 1949 to 1988 and as premier of Bavaria from 1978 to 1988. He also often served as a minister in CDU-CSU federal governments, notably as minister of defense (1956–62) and of finance (1966–69). In 1980 Strauss unsuccessfully ran as the CDU-CSU candidate for chancellor—the first time the coalition had nominated a CSU leader as its candidate for chancellor. In 1999 the party selected as its leader Edmund Stoiber, who had served as premier of Bavaria since 1993. In 2002 Stoiber was selected as the CDU-CSU’s candidate for chancellor in the federal election, which the CDU-CSU narrowly lost. Stoiber had little electoral appeal in the eastern states and was not selected as the CDU-CSU’s candidate for chancellor in 2005.
The CSU is more conservative than the CDU, especially on social issues such as abortion, church-state matters, immigration, and the rights of Germany’s many foreign residents. In foreign policy the CSU also tends to take a more nationalist position; in the 1970s it opposed the effort of the Social Democratic Party-led government of Willy Brandt to normalize relations with eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, and it has tended to be less supportive of European integration than the CDU.
