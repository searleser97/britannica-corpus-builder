Federal Trade Commission (FTC),  independent agency of the U.S. federal government charged with preventing unfair or deceptive trade practices. Established by the Federal Trade Commission Act (1914), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regulates advertising, marketing, and consumer credit practices and also prevents antitrust agreements and other unfair practices. Although it has no authority to punish violators, it can monitor compliance with trade laws, conduct legal investigations, issue cease-and-desist orders, convene public hearings, file civil suits in U.S. district courts, and ensure that court orders are followed.
The FTC is headed by five commissioners who serve seven-year terms. Commissioners are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. By law, no more than three commissioners may be members of the same political party. The FTC is divided into three main bureaus: Consumer Protection, Competition, and Economics.
Through its Bureau of Consumer Protection, the FTC regulates product claims made in advertisements in newspapers, magazines, direct mail, and Internet media and on television and radio. The FTC is particularly vigorous in its regulation of health claims. However, it has no responsibility for political advertising messages, which are regulated by the Federal Election Commission and the Federal Communications Commission.
The FTC also manages the National Do Not Call Registry, which is designed to protect consumers from unwanted telemarketing calls under the provisions of the Telemarketing Sales Rule (TSR).
