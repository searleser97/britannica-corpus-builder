Essex Junto,   in early U.S. history, a group of Federalist political leaders in Massachusetts. John Hancock coined the name for his Essex County opponents at the state constitutional convention of 1778. The Junto (faction) later supported the policies of the Federalist Alexander Hamilton and opposed those of Thomas Jefferson.
Like Hamilton, the Junto leaders supported neutrality, wanted friendship with Britain, and opposed Revolutionary France. In 1803–04, during Jefferson’s first administration, they tried unsuccessfully to form a separate confederation based in New England. They were against Jefferson’s anti-British Embargo Act and eventually brought about its repeal (1809). Their lack of sympathy with the War of 1812 led the Junto to participate in the secessionist Hartford Convention of 1814. After the war they lost their importance. Timothy Pickering was the group’s most conspicuous leader.
