The Nation,  American weekly journal of opinion, the oldest such continuously published periodical still extant. It is generally considered the leading liberal magazine of its kind. It was founded in 1865 by Edwin L. Godkin at the urging of Frederick Law Olmsted.
The Nation under Godkin was an eloquent and increasingly influential voice against Reconstruction excesses, graft and corruption in government, civil service abuses, and the like. In 1881 Godkin sold the magazine to the New York Evening Post, beginning a long association between the two publications. Godkin became an editor of the Post and Wendell Phillips Garrison editor of The Nation, which became a weekly edition of the paper until 1914. The journal began to increase its international coverage and its attention to the arts.
In 1918 Oswald Garrison Villard became editor, and The Nation ended its affiliation with the New York Evening Post and began moving steadily toward the political left. Its circulation dwindled to a few thousand but then, when one issue was refused mailing by the postmaster general, began a recovery. The magazine became vocal in its admiration of the Bolsheviks in Russia and ardently advocated U.S. recognition of the Soviet government, which took place in 1933. Subsequent changes in ownership and editorship kept the journal’s staff and readers in some suspense about its location on the spectrum of the left, with occasional periods of general accord, as during The Nation’s outspoken opposition to the tactics of U.S. Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy in the 1950s and to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. It received grants from supporters to augment its modest circulation and advertising revenues.
In 1995 Victor Navasky, who had been The Nation’s editor since 1978, became its publisher. He held the position until 2005, when he was succeeded by Katrina vanden Heuvel.
