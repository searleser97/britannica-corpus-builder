February Manifesto,  (Feb. 15, 1899) a Russian imperial proclamation that abrogated Finland’s autonomy within the Russian Empire. After Finland was ceded by Sweden to Russia in 1809, it gained the status of a grand duchy, and its constitution was respected; beginning in 1890, however, unconstitutional “Russification” measures were introduced. The February Manifesto, in essence, held that the tsar of Russia could rule Finland by edict, without regard for the grand duchy’s constitution; the legislation of the Finnish Diet was entirely subject to the tsar’s will. This arrangement was justified by the principle of “imperial legislation,” which reduced the status of the grand duchy to that of a mere locality, its constitution and existing laws being henceforth “local” matters. Russification continued under the manifesto until the Russian Revolution of 1905. That November 4 the tsar declared the manifesto null and void, and Russification was soon temporarily abandoned.
