Lapua Movement,   (1929–32), fascist movement in Finland that threatened the young state’s democratic institutions and for a time dictated the policies of the government. It was named for the parish of Lapua, where a fascist group disrupted a meeting of communists late in 1929. The movement, engendered by the Great Depression and influenced by Italian fascism, espoused anticommunism and hatred of Russia. Through 1930 the movement gained wide popular support, and in 1930–31 it unofficially dominated the government, forcing it to outlaw the Finnish Communist Party, to curb radical trade unions, and to intimidate the press. The tactics of the movement included mass demonstrations and kidnapping, raids on newspaper offices, and other forms of terror. Military units of the Lapua under General K.M. Wallenius assembled in February 1932 in preparation for a coup d’état. The government took up the challenge, however, and ordered the units to disarm. The rebels complied, Wallenius and others received mild prison sentences, and early in 1932 Parliament banned the Lapua Movement. Financial and popular support soon evaporated, and the movement collapsed.
