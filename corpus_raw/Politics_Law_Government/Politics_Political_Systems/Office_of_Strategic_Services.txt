Office of Strategic Services (OSS),  agency of the U.S. federal government (1942–45) formed for the purpose of obtaining information about and sabotaging the military efforts of enemy nations during World War II. It was headed by William J. (“Wild Bill”) Donovan (1883–1959). With some 12,000 staff members, the OSS collected and analyzed information on areas of the world in which U.S. military forces were operating. It used agents inside Nazi-occupied Europe, including Berlin, carried out counterpropaganda and disinformation activities, produced analytical reports for policy makers, and staged special operations (e.g., sabotage and demolition) behind enemy lines to support guerrillas and resistance fighters. Many of its functions were later assumed by the Central Intelligence Agency.
