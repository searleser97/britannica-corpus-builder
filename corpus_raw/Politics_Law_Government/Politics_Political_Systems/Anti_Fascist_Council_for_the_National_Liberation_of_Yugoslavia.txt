Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia, Serbo-Croatian Antifašističko Veće Narodnog Oslobođenja Jugoslavije (AVNOJ),  umbrella organization established during World War II by the Communist Party of Yugoslavia to coordinate the military campaigns of Josip Broz Tito’s Partisans and the administrative activities of local “liberation committees.”
AVNOJ was first convened at the Bosnian town of Bihać (Nov. 26–27, 1942). The participation of noncommunists allowed a National Liberation Movement to be announced that called upon all nationalities within Yugoslavia to join the struggle to liberate the country from Axis occupation. This broad appeal won support for the Partisans from a populace grown weary of ethnic hatreds. At its second session, at Jajce (Nov. 29–30, 1943), AVNOJ assumed greater legislative and executive functions and elected a central National Liberation Committee, which became virtually a provisional government. Tito was proclaimed marshal of Yugoslavia, and a plan was adopted for a postwar reorganization of the kingdom into a federation of six equal republics. After its third session, which was convened at Belgrade (Aug. 7–10, 1945) after liberation, AVNOJ yielded its authority to a Constituent Assembly, which, dominated by communists, met in November 1945 to draft a Soviet-style constitution for the new Federal People’s Republic of Yugoslavia.
