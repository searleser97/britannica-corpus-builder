League of Women Voters,  nonpartisan American political organization that has pursued its mission of promoting active and unhampered participation in government since its establishment in 1920.
First proposed by Carrie Chapman Catt at a convention of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) in 1917, the League was organized at a national convention on March 24–29, 1919, in St. Louis, Missouri, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the first suffrage grant. Following the adoption of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920, Catt suggested the reorganization of the two million-strong NAWSA into the League of Women Voters, an organization that would work for progressive legislation on a national and local level. The League was conceived as a nonpartisan, nonsectarian organization with representation from every state. Its chief aims were to provide international support for woman suffrage, to watch over state legislatures and prevent any legal discrimination on the basis of sex, and to strive to make American democratic institutions safe for all those governed by them. The first convention of the League of Women Voters was held in Chicago in 1920.
 Continuing and broadening this mission, the League functions today as a multi-issue grassroots action group open to both men and women that promotes active participation in government and works to “influence public policy through education and advocacy.” With a focus on registering people to vote, providing funding for education about political issues, and defending voting rights, the League is one of the largest nonpartisan political organizations in the United States and one of the only such organizations that successfully provides broad, comprehensive information on a wide variety of political issues.
