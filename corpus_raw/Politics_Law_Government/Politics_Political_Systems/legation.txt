Legation, Italian Legazione,  major administrative division of the Papal States ruled by a cardinal legate during the 18th and 19th centuries. In the mid-19th century, on the eve of Italian unification, there were four such legations: Bologna (including Ferrara and Romagna), Urbino (covering the Marche), Perugia (covering Umbria), and Velletri (covering southern Lazio).
