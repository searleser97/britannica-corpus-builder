European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party (ELDR), byname European Liberal Democrats, formerly (1976–86) Federation of Liberal and Democratic Parties in the European Community and (1986–93) Federation of Liberal Democrat and Reform Parties,  transnational political group representing the interests of allied liberal and centrist parties in Europe, particularly in the European Union (EU). The ELDR was formed in Stuttgart, W.Ger., in 1976 and coordinates the interests of its member parties. It consists of some 50 parties from EU countries, countries that have applied for EU membership, and other European countries. In the European Parliament the ELDR belongs to the larger transnational group known as the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. The ELDR is headquartered in Brussels.
The party traces its roots to the 1940s, when the International World Union (Liberal International) was founded. In 1976 allied European liberal parties adopted the Stuttgart declaration, which called for the protection of individual freedoms, the democratization of the European Economic Community (later renamed the European Community), and the establishment of a common foreign policy. After the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty, the ELDR became an officially recognized political party in the EU in 1993.
The ELDR is headed by a president, who works closely with a bureau composed of the heads of the allied parties in the European Parliament. National party leaders, including ELDR heads of government, meet prior to European summits to coordinate strategy. The chief policy-making organ is the party congress, which meets annually.
