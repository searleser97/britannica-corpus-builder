Disarmament,  in international relations, any of four distinct conceptions: (1) the penal destruction or reduction of the armament of a country defeated in war (the provision under the Versailles Treaty [1919] for the disarmament of Germany and its allies is an example of this conception of disarmament); (2) bilateral disarmament agreements applying to specific geographic areas (naval disarmament in this sense is represented by the Rush-Bagot Agreement between the United States and Great Britain, which, since 1817, has kept the Great Lakes disarmed); (3) the complete abolition of all armaments, as advocated by utopian thinkers and occasionally by governments; and (4) the reduction and limitation of national armament by general international agreement through such international forums as the League of Nations, in the past, and the United Nations, in the present. This last is the most frequent current use of the term.
Disarmament became a more urgent and complicated issue with the rapid development of nuclear weapons capable of mass destruction. Since the explosion of the first atomic bombs in 1945, the previous contention that armaments races were economically inexpedient and led inevitably to war was replaced by the argument that the future use of nuclear weapons in quantity threatened the continued existence of civilization itself. During the post-World War II period, there were discussions at several levels aimed at limiting and controlling armaments. Efforts ranged from continuous talks at the United Nations to such discussions between the United States and the Soviet Union (later, Russia) as the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT I and II) of the 1970s, the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (START I, II, and III) of the 1980s and â€™90s, and the New Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (New START) of the early 2000s.
