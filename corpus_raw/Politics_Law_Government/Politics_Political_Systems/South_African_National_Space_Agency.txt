South African National Space Agency (SANSA),  South African space agency that was founded to develop a national space program and coordinate existing space activities. Its headquarters are in Pretoria. SANSA is run by a chief executive officer, and its activities are divided into four divisions: space operations, space science, Earth observation, and space engineering. SANSA was founded in 2008 and began operations two years later.
Prior to the founding of SANSA, South African space activities had been under the direction of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. The satellite-tracking station at Hartebeesthoek was built by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and was used to receive data from U.S. space missions until 1974, when it became a radio astronomy observatory. In the 1980s South Africa planned to launch its own military reconnaissance satellite, but that program ended in 1994. Two satellites built by South Africa, SunSat and SumbandilaSat, were launched by the United States and Russia in 1999 and 2009, respectively. SANSA subsequently planned to develop other satellites based on SumbandilaSat and to work with the space agencies of other African countries, such as Nigeria and Kenya, on the development of Earth-observation satellites.
