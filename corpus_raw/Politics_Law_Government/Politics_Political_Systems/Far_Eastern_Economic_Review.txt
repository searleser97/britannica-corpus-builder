Far Eastern Economic Review,  former weekly newsmagazine covering general, political, and business and financial news of East and Southeast Asia. It was published in Hong Kong, where it was established in 1946. The magazine carried feature articles on the major developments in the region and on outside developments that affected it. The Far Eastern Economic Review was noted for its objectivity and for the accuracy of its reports. Its editorial stance was oriented toward free trade and market economics, thereby resembling The Economist or The Wall Street Journal, whose publishers, Dow Jones & Company, acquired ownership of the magazine in 1974. For nearly 60 years the Far Eastern Economic Review was the most authoritative and influential newsmagazine of the Far East. Dow Jones retired the weekly journal in 2004 but retained the title as a monthly forum for political and economic essays. In 2009 the Far Eastern Economic Review ceased publication.
