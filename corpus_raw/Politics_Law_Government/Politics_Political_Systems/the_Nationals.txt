The Nationals, also called (1982–2006) National Party of Australia or (1975–82) National Country Party of Australia or (1920–75) Australian Country Party,  Australian political party that for most of its history has held office as a result of its customary alliance with the Liberal Party of Australia. It often acted as a margin in the balance of power, but its own power declined over the years. In 1934 it could command 16 percent of the vote in federal elections. By 1975 its federal vote had fallen to 8 percent. In October 1982 it took the name National Party of Australia. In October 2006 the party changed its name again, to the Nationals, a name by which it had been known informally for several years.
The agricultural interest in Australia first began to organize politically in the 1890s to eliminate import duties on farm machinery, to end the Labor land tax on big estates, and to counter the growing strength of organized labour and the Labor Party. State farmers’ associations with these objectives developed during World War I. The first local Country Party to win seats in an Australian parliament was that in Western Australia in 1914. In 1918 a federal organization was created and in 1920 named the Australian Country Party. In 1923 party leader Earle Page negotiated a coalition agreement with the Nationalist (formerly Liberal) Party leader, Stanley Melbourne Bruce, and led 5 Country Party members into a cabinet of 11. The coalition government, which continued until 1929, focused largely on developing the national economy.
Never again did Page or the party exercise so much influence as in the 1920s. However, it continued to supply votes and ministers to the governments of the Nationalist Party and its successors, the United Australia Party (1931–44) and the Liberal Party (from 1944), when those parties were in power.
