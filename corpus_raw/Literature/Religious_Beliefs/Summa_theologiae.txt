Summa theologiae, also spelled Summa theologica, also called the Summa,  in Roman Catholicism, a systematic compendium of theology written by Thomas Aquinas between about 1265 and 1273. He intended it to be the sum of all known learning as explained according to the philosophy of Aristotle (384–322 bce) and his Arabian commentators (which was being introduced to western European thought at the time) and the theological dicta of the church. The Summa is divided into three parts that may be said to treat of God, Man, and Christ (or the God-Man). The first and second parts are wholly the work of Aquinas; only the first 90 questions of the third part are his. The ending was aborted by his death, and the existing remainder, the Supplement, is a 14th-century compilation from Aquinas’s commentary on Peter Lombard’s Sentences.
