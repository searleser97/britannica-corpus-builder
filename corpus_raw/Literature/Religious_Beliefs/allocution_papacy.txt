Allocution,  historically, an address made by the pope in the course of a secret consistory. The reign of Pius XII (1939â€“58), however, saw addresses (allocutiones) to various congresses and conventions of doctors, scientists, jurists, and other professionals. These speeches became the occasion of significant papal declarations on points of moral theology especially pertinent to the respective audiences.
In common law, allocution is an unsworn address by a defendant to the court, after a guilty verdict has been reached but prior to sentencing. The statement is typically used as an attempt to persuade the judge to impose a more lenient sentence.
