John Reed,  (born Oct. 22, 1887, Portland, Ore., U.S.â€”died  Oct. 19, 1920, Moscow), U.S. poet-adventurer whose short life as a revolutionary writer and activist made him the hero of a generation of radical intellectuals.
Reed, a member of a wealthy Portland family, was graduated from Harvard in 1910 and began writing for a Socialist newspaper, The Masses, in 1913. In 1914 he covered the revolutionary fighting in Mexico and recorded his impressions in Insurgent Mexico (1914). Frequently arrested for organizing and defending strikes, he rapidly became established as a radical leader and helped form the Communist Party in the United States.
He covered World War I for Metropolitan magazine; out of this experience came The War in Eastern Europe (1916). He became a close friend of Lenin and was an eyewitness to the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution in Russia, recording this event in his best known book, Ten Days That Shook the World (1919).
When the U.S. Communist Party and the Communist Labor Party split in 1919, Reed became the leader of the latter. Indicted for treason, he escaped to the Soviet Union and died of typhus; he was subsequently buried with other Bolshevik heroes beside the Kremlin wall. Following his death the Communist Party formed many John Reed clubs, associations of writers and artists, in U.S. cities.
