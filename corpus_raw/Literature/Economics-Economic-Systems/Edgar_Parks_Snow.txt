Edgar Snow,  (born July 19, 1905, Kansas City, Mo., U.S.—died  Feb. 15, 1972, Eysins, Switz.), American journalist and author who produced the most important Western reporting on the Communist movement in China in the years before it achieved power.
Snow attended the University of Missouri and the Columbia School of Journalism before landing his first job as a newspaper reporter for the Kansas City Star in 1927. In 1928 his wanderings took him to China, which became his base for the next 12 years while he reported on East Asia for major American newspapers and magazines.
In 1936 Snow slipped through the Nationalists’ blockade and reached the Chinese Communists’ base at Yen-an in Shensi province, in north-central China. After spending several months in Yen-an with Mao Zedong (Mao Tse-tung) and other leaders, Snow returned to the outside world with the first accurate reporting of the Communist movement in China. Snow depicted Mao Zedong and his followers not as the opportunistic “Red bandits” described by the Nationalists but rather as dedicated revolutionaries who advocated sweeping domestic reforms and who were eager to resist Japanese aggression in China. Snow’s book-length report on the Chinese Communists, Red Star Over China (1937), has remained a primary source on the early history of their movement.
Snow returned to the United States in 1941 and became a reporter for the Saturday Evening Post. He covered the Soviet Union, among other countries, during World War II. He revisited China in 1960 and reported on the state of that country after 11 years of Communist rule in The Other Side of the River: Red China Today (1962).
