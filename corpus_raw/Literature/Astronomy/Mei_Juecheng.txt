Mei Juecheng, Wade-Giles Mei Chüeh-ch’eng,  (born May 19, 1681, Xuan Cheng, Anhui province, China—died November 20, 1763, China), Chinese court official, mathematician, and astronomer.
Mei Juecheng learned mathematics from his grandfather Mei Wending (1633–1721), a renowned mathematician and astronomer. In 1712 Mei Juecheng became a court mathematician and the following year joined the Mengyangzhai (an imperial bureau created to synthesize Western and Chinese scientific knowledge) as one of the chief editors of Lüli yuanyuan (c. 1723; “Source of Mathematical Harmonics and Astronomy”), a compendium on music, mathematics, and astronomy. Unlike earlier such endeavours, this was purely a work of Chinese authorship; Jesuits were not involved in the compilation. The Lüli yuanyuan reapportioned credit to Chinese scholars for many discoveries that earlier Jesuit-Chinese compendiums had credited to Europeans. In particular, studying Western algebra enabled Mei Juecheng to decipher older Chinese mathematical treatises from the Song (920–1279) and Yuan (1206–1368) dynasties whose methods had been lost. This led him to expound a theory of the Chinese origin of Western knowledge. While now acknowledged as grossly overstated, his views helped to revive interest in traditional Chinese mathematics and remained highly influential for many decades. Mei Juecheng collaborated in the 1730s and ’40s on a supplement to the astronomy section while working on the official history of the calendar during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).
Mei Juecheng collected the scientific writings of his grandfather, adding two of his own works on mathematics and astronomy. He was also interested in the preservation of ancient Chinese astronomical instruments and deplored their partial destruction under Jesuit control of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.
