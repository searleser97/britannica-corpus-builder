Star catalog,  list of stars, usually according to position and magnitude (brightness) and, in some cases, other properties (e.g., spectral type) as well. Numerous catalogs and star atlases have been made, some of fundamental importance to stellar astronomy. A star may well appear in several catalogs and be assigned as many different designations.
Hipparchus completed the first known catalog in 129 bce, giving the celestial longitudes and latitudes of about 850 stars. This work was enlarged and improved by Ptolemy, the Alexandrian astronomer and mathematician, in his Almagest (c. 140 ce). At Samarkand (now in Uzbekistan), Ulugh Beg (1394–1499), grandson of Timur (Tamerlane), working in his own observatory in the years 1420–37, compiled a catalog that became known in Europe in the 1500s and was printed there in 1665.
The last and finest catalog of the pretelescope era was made by the skilled Danish observer Tycho Brahe (1546–1601). It was included in expanded form in the Rudolphine Tables of the mathematical astronomer Johannes Kepler. Tycho’s catalog was the first in which Greek letters were assigned to stars to indicate their relative brightnesses within each constellation. The English astronomer John Flamsteed (1646–1719) published his catalog, Historia coelestis Britannica, in 1725. Some of his designations are still in use—e.g., 61 Cygni for the star having the 61st greatest right ascension in the constellation Cygnus. Friedrich W.A. Argelander of Germany compiled the Bonner Durchmusterung (BD) catalog, which lists 324,189 stars and was published 1859–62. Extensive supplements to the BD include the Córdoba Durchmusterung and Cape Photographic Durchmusterung. With the Henry Draper Catalogue (HD), prepared in the late 19th and early 20th centuries at Harvard Observatory, began the present (Harvard) classification of stars by spectral type.
The European Space Agency’s Hipparcos satellite was launched in 1989. Two star catalogs have been generated from the enormous amount of data on stellar positions it obtained. The Hipparcos catalog has positions for 118,218 stars that are accurate to 1 to 3 milliarcseconds. The Tycho-2 catalog is less accurate (10 to 100 milliarcseconds) but has positions for 2,539,913 stars.
