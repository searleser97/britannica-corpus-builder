Andreas Libavius, (Latin), German Andreas Libau,  (born c. 1540, Halle [Germany]—died July 25, 1616, Coburg), German chemist, physician, and alchemist who made important chemical discoveries but is most noted as the author of the first modern chemistry textbook.
Libavius was professor of history and poetry at the University of Jena from 1586 to 1591 and then became town physician and inspector of the Gymnasium at Rothenburg. In 1605 he established the Gymnasium Casimirianum at Coburg.
Of his numerous works, all of which were noted for clear, unambiguous writing, the most important was Alchymia (1606; “Alchemy”), a work that established the tradition for 17th-century French chemistry textbooks. Although he was a firm believer in the transmutation of base metals into gold, Libavius was renowned for his vitriolic attacks against the mysticism and secretiveness of his fellow alchemists. Libavius pioneered in the analytic approach to chemistry. Among his discoveries were methods for the preparation of ammonium sulfate, antimony sulfide, hydrochloric acid, and tin tetrachloride.
