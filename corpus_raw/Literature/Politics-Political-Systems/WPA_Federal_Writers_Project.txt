WPA Federal Writers’ Project,   a program established in the United States in 1935 by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) as part of the New Deal struggle against the Great Depression. It provided jobs for unemployed writers, editors, and research workers. Directed by Henry G. Alsberg, it operated in all states and at one time employed 6,600 men and women. The American Guide series, the project’s most important achievement, included guides for every state and territory (except Hawaii), as well as for Washington, D.C., New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, New Orleans, and Philadelphia; for several major highways (U.S. 1, Ocean Highway, Oregon Trail); and for scores of towns, villages, and counties. The state guides, encyclopaedic in scope, combined travel information with essays on geography, architecture, history, and commerce. The project also produced ethnic studies, folklore collections, local histories, nature studies—a total of more than 1,000 books and pamphlets.
In accordance with WPA regulations, most of the project’s personnel came from the relief rolls. It included such prominent authors of the 1930s as Conrad Aiken, Maxwell Bodenheim, and Claude McKay and such future luminaries as Richard Wright, Ralph Ellison, Nelson Algren, Frank Yerby, Saul Bellow, Loren Eiseley, and Weldon Kees. Congress ended federal sponsorship of the project in 1939 but allowed it to continue under state sponsorship until 1943.
