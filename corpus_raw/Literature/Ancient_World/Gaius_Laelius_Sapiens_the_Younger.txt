Gaius Laelius Sapiens, the Younger,  (flourished  2nd century bc), Roman soldier and politician known chiefly as an orator and a friend of Scipio Aemilianus. Laelius appears as one of the speakers in Cicero’s De senectute (“On Old Age”), De amicitia (“On Friendship”; also called Laelius), and De republica (“On the Republic”).
In 147 Laelius accompanied Scipio Aemilianus during the siege of Carthage and distinguished himself in the capture of the city’s military harbour. Two years later he was praetor in Spain, and in 140 he became consul. Laelius helped prosecute the supporters of the agrarian reformer Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus (tribune in 133), and in 131 he opposed Gaius Papirius Carbo’s bill to legalize the reelection of tribunes. His involvement with a famous embassy from Athens, consisting of the heads of various schools of philosophy, gave him his cognomen: Sapiens, “the wise.” Cicero portrayed him as a cultured gentleman, poet, and student of philosophy who sought to blend the better elements of Greek and Roman culture.
