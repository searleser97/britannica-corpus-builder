Herodes Atticus, in full Lucius Vibullius Hipparchus Tiberius Claudius Atticus Herodes,  (born 101 ce, Marathon, Attica—died 177), most celebrated of the orators and writers of the Second Sophistic, a movement that revitalized the teaching and practice of rhetoric in Greece in the 2nd century ce.
Herodes was born into an immensely wealthy Athenian family that had received Roman citizenship during the reign of the emperor Claudius (41–54). He was befriended by Hadrian (emperor 117–138), who employed him as a commissioner in charge of eliminating corruption in the free cities of the province of Asia. Herodes became consul in 143 and later contributed to the education of Hadrian’s destined successors, Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus. Under his direction numerous buildings were constructed throughout Greece, including an odeum (called the Odeum of Herodes Atticus) at Athens.
Of his voluminous output of speeches and other writings, nothing unquestionably authentic survives, although one speech, “On the Constitution,” survives under his name. The 2nd-century writer Aulus Gellius preserves the Latin translation of an anecdote from a speech by Herodes defending the sadness he displayed on the loss of a beloved child. Evidently he was a strict Atticist; i.e., he took the Athenian writers of the 5th and 4th centuries bce as his stylistic models. Like other 2nd-century Sophists, he sought to entertain and enlighten without referring to political matters. An inscription published in 1970 discusses the emperor Marcus Aurelius’s attempts to reconcile Herodes Atticus with his enemies in Athens, who accused him of tyranny in 174 ce. Herodes’s activities are recorded in Philostratus’s Lives of the Sophists.
