Freda Kirchwey,  (born Sept. 26, 1893, Lake Placid, N.Y., U.S.—died Jan. 3, 1976, St. Petersburg, Fla.), American editor and publisher, remembered for her long association with the liberal magazine The Nation.
Kirchwey was the daughter of a Columbia University Law School professor and dean and later (1915–16) warden of Sing Sing State Prison (now Ossining Correctional Facility). She graduated from Barnard College, New York City, in 1915 and became a reporter for the New York Morning Telegraph. In 1917–18 she wrote for Every Week magazine, and in 1918 she joined the editorial staff of The Nation under the editorship of Oswald Garrison Villard. She advanced quickly to editor of the international relations section and in 1922 to managing editor. In 1925 she edited a collection of Nation articles on Our Changing Morality. She succeeded Villard as editor in 1933, and in 1937 she bought the journal.
Under her management and editorship The Nation continued to be a leading national forum and advocate of liberal policies as well as a source of informed comment and criticism on the arts and society. The Nation strongly supported the New Deal, opposed isolationism and neutrality in the years preceding World War II, and spoke out against hysteria and repression in the name of anticommunism in the 1940s and ’50s. In 1947 Kirchwey transferred ownership of the magazine to the Nation Associates, of which she was thereafter president. In 1955 she retired as editor (she was succeeded by Carey McWilliams). In her later years she devoted much time to such organizations as the Committee for World Disarmament, the Women’s International League for the Rights of Man, and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
