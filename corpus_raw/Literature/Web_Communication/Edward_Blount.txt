Edward Blount,  Blount also spelled Blunt,  (born c. 1565—died  after 1632), publisher and translator who, with Isaac and William Jaggard, printed the First Folio of William Shakespeare’s plays (1623).
After serving as an apprentice to London publisher William Ponsonby, Blount in 1588 became a freeman of the Stationers’ Company and opened a bookshop in London. His early publications include Giovanni Florio’s Italian-English dictionary (1595) and Florio’s translation of Montaigne’s essays (1603), and Christopher Marlowe’s Hero and Leander (1598), containing a dedication by Blount in which he speaks of his close friendship with the late poet. In 1612 he published Thomas Shelton’s translation of Don Quixote, the first English version. The First Folio of Shakespeare’s plays, entitled Mr. William Shakespeares Comedies, Histories and Tragedies. Published According to the True Originall Copies, appeared in 1623. It had been produced by Shakespeare’s colleagues at the Globe theatre, Henry Condell and John Heminge, but Blount presumably also acted as editor.
