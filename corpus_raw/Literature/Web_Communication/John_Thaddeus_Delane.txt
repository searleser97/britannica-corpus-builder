John Thaddeus Delane,  (born October 11, 1817, London, England—died November 22, 1879, Ascot, Berkshire), editor of The Times of London for 36 years.
Delane, the second son of a distinguished barrister and author, was reared in Easthampstead, Berkshire, where his family was neighbour to John Walter II, owner of The Times. Walter knew young Delane and marked the boy as a likely prospect for a newspaper career. After studying for two years at King’s College, London, Delane attended the University of Oxford, from which he graduated in 1839. He had, in his college days, written several newspaper articles, and he went to work for The Times. His father had become the paper’s financial manager, but John’s bent was editorial. Hardly had he started working there when the editor, Thomas Barnes, died, and Walter made young Delane editor at age 23.
In his long career Delane built the paper’s prestige to unprecedented heights. He had been born into the ruling establishment, and he was a frequent confidant of cabinet ministers and others high in government. Under his editorship The Times increased its circulation, which reached about 70,000 in the mid-1800s. Delane was sometimes accused of subservience to the government, but he denied this vigorously. The Times under his editorship consistently influenced government policies. In his editorial policies, Delane tried to remain impartial even though he privately favoured liberal causes. In 1845 he organized a special “Times express” that carried mail—including dispatches from Times correspondents—from Alexandria, Egypt, to London, which it reached two weeks before regular mail. He retired in 1877, after having edited The Times for nearly his entire adult life. He died two years later.
