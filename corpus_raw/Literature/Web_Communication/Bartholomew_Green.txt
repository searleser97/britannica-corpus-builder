Bartholomew Green,  (born October 12, 1666, Cambridge, Massachusetts [U.S.]—died December 28, 1732, Boston, Massachusetts), British American printer and journalist who published the Boston News-Letter, America’s first successful newspaper, from 1704 to 1707 and again from 1711 to 1732. Refusing to take sides in the colonists’ disputes with England, Green selected for publication in his paper only “those transactions…that have no relations to any of our [American-British] quarrels.” In 1727, in an effort to build the influence of his paper, he promised his readers that he would print up-to-date news rather than reports of “occurrencies of an old date.”
Green was born to a family of printers. His own career spanned a half century. He assisted his half brother Samuel Green in managing Samuel Sewall’s press from 1682, when he was 16 years old, to 1684. Then he operated a printing establishment of his own until 1690, and he later worked for two years with his father, Samuel Green, who was also a publisher, in Cambridge. Resuming his own business, Bartholomew Green found his way into the colonial establishment and served for the next 40 years as chief printer of the Massachusetts colony.
