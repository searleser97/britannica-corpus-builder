Ludwig von Gerlach,  (born March 7, 1795, Berlin—died  Feb. 18, 1877, Berlin), Prussian judge, politician, and editor who helped found the conservative newspaper Kreuzzeitung (1848), which became the voice of the Conservative Party, and which opposed Bismarck’s unification plans for Germany during the 1860s and ’70s.
Like his brother Leopold, Ludwig took part in the Napoleonic Wars and shared the same beliefs and circle of friends. After holding a number of judicial posts, he was appointed to work with the eminent jurist F.K. von Savigny on the law code reform (1842). From 1844 to 1874 he served as president of the Magdeburg appeals court.
The founding of the Kreuzzeitung gave him a platform from which to expound his conservative views. A strong Christian, Ludwig advocated freedom of the church from state interference and the formation of Protestants and Catholics into one conservative political bloc. He influenced practical politics chiefly through his brother. After serving as a conservative member in the post-1848 diets, Ludwig entered the Prussian diet (1873), and the Reichstag (1877), as a deputy of the Catholic Centre Party, though he was himself a lifelong Protestant. He sided with the church against Bismarck during the latter’s persecution of Catholics, the Kulturkampf (1872–79). Defending Austria’s position in Germany, Ludwig opposed Bismarck’s manoeuvres to create a united Germany based on Prussian hegemony.
