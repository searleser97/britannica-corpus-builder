Bernard Shaw,  (born May 22, 1940, Chicago, Ill., U.S.), American television journalist and the first chief anchor for the Cable News Network (CNN). Shaw’s childhood heroes included newsman Edward R. Murrow, whose television broadcasts inspired Shaw to pursue a career in journalism. He became an avid reader of newspapers in his hometown of Chicago, contributed to his high school paper, and read announcements for the school through its public-address system.
While serving in the U.S. Marine Corps (1959–63), Shaw introduced himself to CBS News correspondent Walter Cronkite, declaring his intention to join Cronkite at CBS in the future. While studying at the University of Illinois, Shaw began work as a radio news reporter and TV news writer (1964–68), and the Westinghouse Broadcast Corporation offered him an assignment covering the White House. By 1971 he had joined CBS as a reporter. He received a promotion to correspondent in 1974 but eventually moved to ABC as its Latin American correspondent in 1977. While in this role, he covered the Jonestown tragedy and interviewed Cuban President Fidel Castro. Shaw returned to Washington, D.C., in 1979 and finished the decade covering Capitol Hill and the hostage crisis in Iran.
On June 1, 1980, Shaw helped launch CNN as its chief anchor. He also broke new ground by moderating a presidential debate in 1988, covering the protests by Chinese students at Tiananmen Square in 1989, and scooping the world with on-the-scene coverage of the first U.S. bombing of Baghdad, Iraq, in 1991. He retired from CNN’s anchor desk in 2001. Among the numerous awards Shaw earned were the George Foster Peabody Award (1990), the University of Missouri’s Honor Medal for Distinguished Service in Journalism (1992), and the Congress of Racial Equality’s Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Award for Outstanding Achievement (1993).
