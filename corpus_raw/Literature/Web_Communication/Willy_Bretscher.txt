Willy Bretscher,  (born October 26, 1897, Winterthur, Switzerland—died January 12, 1992, Zürich), Swiss editor, from 1933 to 1967, of Neue Zürcher Zeitung (NZZ) of Zürich, one of the world’s leading daily newspapers. Bretscher carried forward for two generations the NZZ tradition of careful, thorough reporting that dated back to the paper’s founding in 1780. He built a staff of highly qualified writers and was many years ahead of his time in employing numerous journalists with university degrees.
Bretscher was educated in Swiss public schools, the Commercial School of the Swiss Merchants’ Association, and the University of Zürich. He began his career in journalism in 1914 on the Neues Winterthure Tagblatt, which he left in 1917 to join the NZZ. He served as the paper’s Berlin correspondent from 1925 to 1929. Bretscher became known in the 1930s for his opposition to Nazism and other forms of totalitarianism, his dedication to objectivity, and his courage. The Hitler government banned the NZZ from Nazi Germany in 1934 after the paper revealed that Nazis, not communists, had burned the Reichstag, the German parliament building in Berlin. Bretscher later took stands against communism and some forms of socialism.
Bretscher wrote a number of books, including History of the Socialist Movement in Switzerland (1924), The Political Situation in Switzerland at the End of the War (1945), and Swiss Foreign Policy in the Postwar Period (1951).
