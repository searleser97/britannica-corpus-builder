He was instrumental in organizing the American Library Association in 1876 and in founding the Library Journal, which he edited for more than 50 years; he also edited or published the Annual Library Index, the American Catalog, and Publishers Weekly. As a champion of authors’ rights Bowker became a noted authority on copyright and wrote two books on copyright history, literature, and law. He organized the earliest list of state documents and other important bibliographies and also wrote books on business, politics, education, religion, and economics.
A proponent of civil service reform, Bowker drafted the first national civil service reform plank. He also helped form the Independent Republican, or “Mugwump,” movement in 1879.
