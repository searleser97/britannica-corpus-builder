A.S. Abell, in full Arunah Shepardson Abell,  (born August 10, 1806, East Providence, Rhode Island, U.S.—died April 19, 1888, Baltimore, Maryland), newspaper editor and publisher, and founder, with two other investors, of the Philadelphia Public Ledger and the Baltimore Sun.
Abell left school at the age of 14 to become a clerk in a store dealing in West Indian wares. He had hoped to become a printer, and in 1822 he was taken on as an apprentice by the Providence Patriot. He set up shop as a printer in Boston and then in New York. He came to the conclusion that Philadelphia was a likely market for a new penny paper. He and his partners, William M. Swain and Azariah H. Simmons, founded the Public Ledger in 1836. Within two years the paper had absorbed the rival Philadelphia Transcript. Meanwhile, in 1837, Abell founded the Baltimore Sun, which had 12,000 subscribers after a year. Both the Public Ledger and the Sun were oriented to the workingman, but, whereas the Ledger dealt freely in scandal and sensation, the Sun did not. As manager of the Sun, Abell, in cooperation with the publishers of the New Orleans Daily Picayune, established a “pony express” of relay riders between Baltimore and New Orleans to speed the transmission of news. In a historic “news beat,” the express delivered in Baltimore the news of the U.S. Army victory at Vera Cruz, Mexico, before the U.S. government had learned of it. Abell then sent word of the victory by telegram to President James K. Polk. He had encouraged Samuel F.B. Morse in developing the telegraph and was one of its most enthusiastic pioneer users.
An innovator who stressed technical progress, Abell used telegraph machines and carrier pigeons to speed news transmission. Under his direction, the Baltimore Sun became the first American newspaper to install a rotary press. In 1861, when the Civil War began, the Sun had a circulation estimated at 30,000. Abell directed the Sun until his death.
