Benjamin Harris,  (flourished 1673–1716), English bookseller and writer who was the first journalist in the British-American colonies.
An ardent Anabaptist and Whig, Harris published argumentative pamphlets in London, especially ones attacking Roman Catholics and Quakers, and in 1679 he joined Titus Oates in exposing the Popish Plot. In 1686, to escape fines and further imprisonment, he fled to Boston, where he established a successful bookstore and coffeehouse with his son Vavasour. His newspaper, Publick Occurrences, Both Foreign and Domestick (Sept. 25, 1690), the first newspaper printed in the colonies, was suppressed by Boston authorities after one issue. Sometime before 1690 Harris published The New-England Primer, adapted from his earlier, savagely political speller, The Protestant Tutor (1679); the primer was for half a century the only elementary textbook in America. Its 80 pages, measuring 4 1/2 by 3 inches, contained woodcuts illustrating the alphabet, crude couplets, and moral texts, including the child’s prayer, “Now I lay me down to sleep.” Harris returned to London and journalism in 1695. His London Post appeared regularly from 1699 to 1706.
