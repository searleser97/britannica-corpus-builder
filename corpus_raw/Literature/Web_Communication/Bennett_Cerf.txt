Bennett Cerf, in full Bennett Alfred Cerf,  (born May 25, 1898, New York, New York, U.S.—died August 27, 1971, Mount Kisco, New York), American publisher and editor. With Donald S. Klopfer, in 1925 Cerf acquired the Modern Library imprint, which subsequently became a highly profitable series of reprints of classic books. In 1927 they began publishing books other than Modern Library titles as Random House, of which Cerf served as president (1927–65) and chairman (1965–70). He became known as an opponent of censorship and as the publisher of many eminent authors. An inveterate punster and raconteur, he edited anthologies of humour, short stories, and plays, wrote syndicated newspaper columns, and appeared on the popular television show “What’s My Line?” (1952–68).
