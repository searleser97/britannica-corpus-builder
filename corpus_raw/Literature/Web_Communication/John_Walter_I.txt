John Walter, I,  (born 1739, probably in London, Englandâ€”died November 16, 1812, Teddington, Middlesex), English founder of The Times, London, and of a family that owned the newspaper for almost 125 years. Considered neither an outstanding nor an honest journalist, Walter nevertheless turned from scandal to more serious reportage and organized (while in prison for having libeled members of the British royal family) a news service from the European continent, which thereby launched The Times on its course toward preeminence in covering foreign news.
Previously a coal dealer and marine-insurance underwriter (in 1782, an underwriting loss due to the American Revolution forced him into bankruptcy), Walter in 1783 acquired the patent for a system of printing from logotypes (fonts of words or portions of words rather than single letters). He then took over a disused printing works in Blackfriars, London. Intending to print and sell books and pamphlets, he began on January 1, 1785, to publish a newspaper, the Daily Universal Register, merely to call attention to his printing process and his other publications. When the logotype process failed, he was forced to concentrate on the newspaper itself, renaming it The Times for the issue of January 1, 1788. For several years he drew much of his income from prominent persons wishing to suppress news. Because he had published criminal libels on the prince of Wales (afterward King George IV) and the duke of York, Walter for two years had to edit The Times from prison. From 1795 he allowed his sons William Walter and John Walter II to manage the paper.
