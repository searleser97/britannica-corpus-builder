Francis Andrew March,  (born Oct. 25, 1825, Millbury, Mass., U.S.—died  Sept. 9, 1911, Easton, Pa.), American language scholar and lexicographer who was a principal founder of modern comparative Anglo-Saxon (Old English) linguistics.
In 1857 March became professor of English language and comparative philology at Lafayette College, Easton, north of Philadelphia. He occupied this post, the first chair of its kind, until 1907.
March’s monumental work was A Comparative Grammar of the Anglo-Saxon Language (1870; reprinted, 1977), based on 10 years of intensive research. He examined the relationship of Anglo-Saxon to Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, and five Germanic languages. It was immediately recognized in Europe and the United States as a front-ranking achievement, laying the cornerstone for subsequent historical studies of English. For a number of years he directed U.S. efforts contributing to the New English Dictionary on Historical Principles (Oxford English Dictionary). The Spelling Reform (1881) was his chief contribution to the reform of English orthography. With his son Francis Andrew March (1863–1928), he edited A Thesaurus Dictionary of the English Language (1903; 2nd ed., 1980).
