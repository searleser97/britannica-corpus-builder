James Owen Dorsey,  (born Oct. 31, 1848, Baltimore, Md., U.S.â€”died  Feb. 4, 1895, Washington, D.C.), American ethnologist known principally for his linguistic and ethnographic studies of the Siouan tribes.
Dorsey was ordained a deacon of the Protestant Episcopal Church in 1871 and proselytized among the Ponca tribe in the Dakota Territory. Adept in classical linguistics, he quickly learned the Ponca language, but illness forced him to return to Baltimore. When the Bureau of American Ethnology was established (1879), Dorsey, one of its first members, was sent to Nebraska to study the Omaha tribe. He was a diligent worker, studying, among the Siouan linguistic stock, the Osage, Kansa, and Dakota tribes. He also studied the Athabascan, Takelman, Kusan, and Yakonan language stocks of Oregon. His works include Omaha Sociology (1884), Osage Traditions (1888), and Siouan Sociology (1897). He edited two works by Stephen Return Riggs, A Dakota-English Dictionary (1890) and Dakota Grammar, Texts, and Ethnography (1893), both of which have remained classics in their field.
