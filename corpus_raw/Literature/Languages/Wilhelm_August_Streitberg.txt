Wilhelm Streitberg,  (born Feb. 23, 1864, Rüdesheim, Nassau [Germany]—died  Aug. 19, 1925, Leipzig, Ger.), German historical linguist who, with Karl Brugmann, founded (1891) and edited Indogermanische Forschungen (“Indo-European Researches”), an influential journal in the field of Indo-European linguistic studies.
Much of Streitberg’s scholarly work concerns comparative and historical Germanic linguistics. His books include Urgermanische Grammatik (1896; “Proto-Germanic Grammar”), Gotisches Elementarbuch (1897; “Gothic Primer”), and Die gotische Bibel (1908–10; “The Gothic Bible”), which presents the extant biblical texts written in the Gothic language. During his academic career he held professorships at Freiburg (1889–98), Münster (1899–1909), Munich (1909–20), and Leipzig (1920 until his death).
