C.K. Ogden, in full Charles Kay Ogden,  (born June 1, 1889, Fleetwood, Lancashire, Eng.—died  March 20, 1957, London), British writer and linguist who originated Basic English (q.v.), a simplified system of the English language intended as a uniform, standardized means of international communication.
In 1912 Ogden founded an intellectual weekly, The Cambridge Magazine, to which Thomas Hardy, George Bernard Shaw, H.G. Wells, and other noted literary figures contributed. In 1919 he turned it into a quarterly and, with the literary scholar I.A. Richards, began publishing preliminary sketches for a book on the theory of language, The Meaning of Meaning (1923). In this work he attempted to draw insights from modern psychological research to bear on the linguistic problem of word meaning. The chapter on definition contained the germ of Basic (short for British, American, scientific, international, commercial) English, which took its final form in 1928. His Basic Vocabulary (1930) and Basic English (1930) were followed by The System of Basic English (1934). General interest in Basic English did not develop until after 1943, however, when Winston Churchill, with the support of Franklin D. Roosevelt, appointed a committee to study the extension of its use. Ogden’s efforts resulted in conceptions of language learning that are still productive.
