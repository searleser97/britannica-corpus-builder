Dhola, also called Nal Purana,  oral epic that is sung in various Hindi dialects in honour of the goddess Shakti and is performed in the western portion of Uttar Pradesh, as well as in parts of Rajasthan, Punjab, and Madhya Pradesh.
Two major themes run through Dhola: the use of Shakta subjects and the incorporation and validation of a much wider range of caste and gender images than is common in the dominant Sanskrit epics. Telling the story of Raja Nal, his wives Motini and Damayanti, and his son Dhola, the epic incorporates the goddess, who responds to the devotion of the human actors and resolves the many problems encountered by its human heroes. Another Shakta element is the tantric magic of Nath yogis (a northern sect of holy men with gurus) that is used by the heroines as they work to resolve the conflicts created by their men. Caste and gender images reflect the multicaste peasant farming communities where the epic is popular. Raja Nal’s friend and helper is a Gujar (a herding caste), and, as the epic unfolds, Raja Nal is given or takes on various disguises, as a trader, an acrobat, an oil presser, a charioteer, a lame man, and a woman. Those elements in the epic speak to its lower-caste singers (always male) and its rural audiences.
Dhola has recognizable narrative connections to the Nala-Damayanti story found in the Mahabharata as well as to the Rajasthani ballad known as “Dhola-Maru.”
