Anthony Melissa,   (flourished  11th century), Byzantine monk, author whose collection of teachings and maxims taken from Sacred Scripture, early Christian writers, and secular authors promoted a popular Greek Orthodox tradition of moral–ascetical practice.
Anthony, whose surname is derived from the title of his chief work, Melissa (Greek: “The Bee”), compiled an anthology based largely on two leading sources for Eastern Orthodox spirituality: the Hiera Parallēla (“Sacred Parallels”), commonly credited to the early-8th-century Greek church father John of Damascus, and the Eklogai (“Selections”), incorrectly ascribed to the 7th-century Greek master of ascetical theology, St. Maximus the Confessor.
Composed of two books, Melissa provides comprehensive extracts from a broad spectrum of early Christian and non-Christian literature, chosen for their relevance to contemplative spirituality and liturgical piety. Melissa appears in a turgid 16th-century Latin translation, accompanying the Greek text, in the series by J.-P. Migne (ed.), Patrologia Graeca, (vol. 136, 1866). Anthony possibly also wrote an informal work, Christoithia (“Good Manners”), designed for the social and moral edification of Greek youth, which gained popularity in Byzantine society. Some historians claim the work is actually that of an 18th-century Greek scholar, Anthony the Byzantine, headmaster of the Greek school in Istanbul, who supposedly in 1720 rendered into literary Greek the De civilitate morum puerilium (“On the Civility of Adolescent Manners”) by the early-16th-century Humanist Erasmus.
