Letter of Aristeas,  pseudepigraphal work of pseudo-history produced in Alexandria, probably in the mid-2nd century bc, to promote the cause of Judaism. Though the size and prestige of the Jewish community had already secured for itself a definite place in Alexandrian society and serious anti-Semitism had not yet gained currency, the Jewish community was in conflict. While some Jews embraced Greek culture and philosophy, others refused any rapprochement with Hellenistic culture. The author’s purpose was to present Judaism in a favourable light to pagans and make strict observance of religious laws attractive to Hellenistic Jews. The author assumed the name of a 2nd-century-bc writer and purported to give a contemporary account of the translation of the Hebrew Pentateuch, the first five books of the Bible, into Greek. He presented himself as a pagan admirer of Judaism who held a high position in the court of Ptolemy II Philadelphus (285–246 bc) in Alexandria. The writer used current Hellenistic literary conventions and the technical language of the Alexandrian court, but his Greek style and several historical inaccuracies indicate that he was a deliberate archaist. His concern for the welfare of Jewish slaves, his romantic picture of Palestinian Jewry, and his efforts to explain the theory behind Jewish dietary laws mark him as a Jew rather than a pagan.
Modern scholars call this work a “letter” because it was addressed by Aristeas to his brother Philocrates. The narrative draws upon a wide variety of sources: a report on Egyptian Jews from official archives, texts of Ptolemaic legal decrees, administrative memoranda preserved in royal files or in the Alexandria library, accounts of pilgrimages to Jerusalem, a treatise on the ideals of kingship, and an apology for Jewish law. The first writer to quote directly from the Letter was the Jewish historian Josephus (1st century ad). Several early Christians also used the book, ignoring its Jewish apologetic features.
