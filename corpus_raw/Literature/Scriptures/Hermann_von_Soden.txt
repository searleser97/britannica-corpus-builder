Hermann von Soden,  (born Aug. 16, 1852, Cincinnati, Ohio, U.S.—died  Jan. 15, 1914, Berlin, Ger.), German biblical scholar who established a new theory of textual history of the New Testament.
Educated at the University of Tübingen, he was ordained and was a minister in Dresden-Striesen in 1881 and from 1887 at the Jerusalem Church in Berlin. From 1889 Soden taught at the University of Berlin.
Soden applied the Liberal school of biblical criticism to the New Testament (see liberalism, theological) and hypothetically concluded in his Die Schriften des neuen Testament (1902–13; “The Writings of the New Testament”) that all extant New Testament texts were derived from an original 2nd-century document (which he reconstructed) but were altered by the intrusion of the Diatessaron version by the late 2nd-century Gnostic Christian Tatian.
