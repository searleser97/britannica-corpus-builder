Martyrdom of Polycarp,   letter that describes the death by burning of Polycarp, bishop of Smyrna in Asia Minor. It was sent to the Christian church in Philomelium, Asia Minor, from the church in Smyrna (modern İzmir, Tur.) and is the oldest authentic account of an early Christian martyr’s death. Establishing the exact date of the death of Polycarp is difficult and has been the subject of much debate among scholars. The date suggested by the letter itself is 155; but the date given by Eusebius, bishop of Caesarea (d. c. 340), in his Ecclesiastical History is 167–168.
The account of the martyrdom was quoted extensively in the Ecclesiastical History. Unfortunately, the letter as presented in extant Greek manuscripts, the oldest of which dates from the 10th century, is somewhat different from the account given by Eusebius, so that probably the work has undergone interpolation. The later manuscripts include an elaborate comparison of the death of Polycarp with that of Christ.
