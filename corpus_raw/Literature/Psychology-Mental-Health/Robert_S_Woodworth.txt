Robert S. Woodworth, in full Robert Sessions Woodworth,  (born October 17, 1869, Belchertown, Massachusetts, U.S.—died July 4, 1962, New York, New York), American psychologist who conducted major research on learning and developed a system of “dynamic psychology” into which he sought to incorporate several different schools of psychological thought.
Woodworth worked as a mathematics instructor before turning to psychology. He pursued graduate studies under William James at Harvard University and James McKeen Cattell at Columbia University, where he received his Ph.D. in 1899. In 1901 Woodworth and Edward L. Thorndike demonstrated that training could not be transferred; learning one subject did not produce an overall improvement in learning ability. He continued his research at Columbia and became professor of psychology there in 1909.
Woodworth asserted that both behaviour and consciousness were the subject matter of psychology. He believed that behaviour was a function of both environmental stimuli and the makeup of the organism. He also suggested that a mechanism (how a thing is done) can take on the function of a drive (the motive force for doing it).
Woodworth designed the first questionnaire to detect and measure abnormal behaviour; it served as a rough screening device for behavioral disorders. His Dynamic Psychology (1918) attempted to explain behaviour by combining theories of motivation, perception, learning, and thinking, while his Psychology (1921) became a standard textbook. Throughout his career, he attempted to develop a unified theory of psychology based on thorough scientific observations and cautious generalizations from them.
