Dale Carnegie, original name Dale Carnegey,  (born November 24, 1888, Maryville, Missouri, U.S.—died November 1, 1955, Forest Hills, New York), American lecturer, author, and pioneer in the field of public speaking and the psychology of the successful personality.
Carnegie was born into poverty on a farm in Missouri. In high school and college he was active in debating clubs. After graduating he was a salesman in Nebraska and an actor in New York City and finally taught public speaking at the YMCA. His classes became extremely successful, and Carnegie began lecturing to packed houses. To standardize his teaching methods he began publishing pamphlets, which he collected into book form as Public Speaking: A Practical Course for Business Men (1926; also published as Public Speaking and Influencing Men in Business). At this time he also served as manager for a lecture tour with Lowell Thomas and compiled Little Known Facts About Well Known People (1934).
Carnegie became an instant success with the hugely popular How To Win Friends and Influence People (1936). Like most of his books, it revealed little that was unknown about human psychology but stressed that an individual’s attitude is crucial. He taught that anyone could benefit from a handicap if it were advantageously presented. Carnegie capitalized on the American longing for success by selling advice that helped readers feel, and perhaps become, successful. Other books include How to Stop Worrying and Start Living (1948), which is primarily a collection of commonsense tricks to prevent stress.
