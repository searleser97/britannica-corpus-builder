Wang Tao, Wade-Giles romanization Wang T’ao, original name Wang Libing,  (born Nov. 10, 1828, Luzhi, near Suzhou, Jiangsu province, China—died  autumn 1897, Shanghai), one of the pioneers of modern journalism in China and early leader of the movement to reform traditional Chinese institutions along Western lines.
Wang’s sympathy with the long, widespread Taiping Rebellion in South China (1850–64) aroused the enmity of officials in the Qing dynasty (1644–1911) government. Forced to flee to British-controlled Hong Kong, Wang met the Scottish scholar James Legge, whom he aided in his monumental translation of the Five Classics of Confucianism. During this 10-year period, Wang spent two years with Legge in Europe, where he became acquainted with Western thought and institutions.
Returning to Hong Kong in 1870, he became an independent journalist, founding and editing one of the first modern newspapers in China. Later, he also wrote for the influential Shanghai newspaper Shen Bao (“Shanghai Journal”). In his newspaper writing he urged the introduction of Western-style arsenals, shipyards, and mines. He also was one of the first to warn that the strength of the West lay not merely in its superior military technology but also in its democratic political system, which encouraged its superior technology to develop. He therefore called for the reform of the Chinese military, educational, administrative, and legal systems.
Wang did not see Western institutions as something foreign to China but felt that democratic and scientific ideas were implicit in the Confucian Classics, which he maintained the Chinese had misinterpreted in recent centuries. Wang influenced many Chinese leaders of the generation that followed his, including the famous scholar-reformer Kang Youwei (1858–1927) and the great Chinese revolutionary Sun Yat-sen (1866–1925).
