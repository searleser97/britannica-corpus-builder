Nathan Cook Meeker,  (born July 12, 1817, Euclid, Ohio, U.S.—died  September 1879, White River Agency, Colo.), American journalist and social reformer who founded the utopian Union Colony at Greeley, Colo.
A wanderer from the age of 17, Meeker tried teaching and newspaper work and became interested in socialist experiments. As agricultural editor of Horace Greeley’s New York Tribune (c. 1865), he studied the Oneida Community (a radical social and religious group, near Oneida, N.Y.) and Mormon farm cooperatives. In December 1869 he organized the Union Colony, and in 1870 the first settlers, chosen for their moral and intellectual convictions, arrived at Greeley (named for the colony’s principal backer). Meeker lived there until 1878, when he became Indian agent at the White River Agency. There he tried to convert the Ute Indians from hunting and fishing to farming and a settled life. Ute resentment against the U.S. government’s failure to fulfill treaty obligations turned to fury against Meeker the following year, when he plowed an irrigation ditch across the track where they exercised and raced their horses. Meeker requested military aid, but the Utes ambushed the troops hurrying to White River and killed Meeker and all other white men at the agency.
