Hagen, also called Hagano or Hogni,  mythological Germanic hero who plays a variety of roles in a number of northern European legends. In the Nibelungenlied, he appears as a vassal of the Burgundian king Gunther and is a grizzled warrior, loyal and wary. He plays a principal role in the epic as the slayer of Siegfried, who becomes the chief object of hatred and revenge of Siegfriedâ€™s widow, Kriemhild. The last of the Nibelungen to be killed, Hagen is decapitated by Kriemhild. The Latin heroic epic Waltharius, in which he is called Hagano, treats of his youth as a hostage and his escape and subsequent attachment to King Guntharius. In Old Norse poems he is Hogni, the brother of Gunnar; both brothers meet their death at the hands of Atli (Attila). See Atli, Lay of.
