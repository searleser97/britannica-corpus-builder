Yamato Takeru, in full Yamato Takeru No Mikoto (Japanese: “Prince Brave of Yamato”),  Japanese folk hero, noted for his courage and ingenuity, who may have lived in the 2nd century ad. His tomb at Ise is known as the Mausoleum of the White Plover.
The legendary son of the legendary 12th emperor Keikō, Yamato Takeru was supposedly responsible for expanding the territory of the Yamato court. His story appears in the chronicles Kojiki (completed in 712) and Nihon Shoki (“Japanese Chronicles”; completed in 720). In the stories, he subdued two uncouth Kumaso warriors by cleverly disguising himself as a woman and, at a banquet in his honour, killing them while they were drunk. He cut away the burning grass of a fire set by the Ainu tribesmen with the miraculous sword Kusanagi and escaped. His adventures ended on the plains of Tagi, where he was stricken with illness and, according to legend, changed into a white plover and disappeared from the world.
