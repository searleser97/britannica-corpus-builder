Ogier The Dane, French Ogier De Danemarche, Danish Holger Danske,  an important character in the French medieval epic poems called chansons de geste. His story is told in a cycle of these poems known as Geste de Doon de Mayence, which deals with the wars of the feudal barons against the emperor Charlemagne. The character of Ogier has a historical prototype in Autcharius, a follower of Carloman, Charlemagne’s younger brother, whose kingdom Charlemagne invaded in 771 after Carloman’s death. Although Ogier is referred to in the chansons as the son of the Danish king Gaufrey and later became a national hero celebrated in Danish folk song, the surname “of Danemarche” probably originally signified the marches of the Ardennes and not Denmark.
Ogier was the hero of another chanson of the early 12th century, called La Chevalerie Ogier de Danemarche, which told of his reconciliation with Charlemagne. Later in the century, Les Enfances Ogier places him at Charlemagne’s court, highly esteemed for his military prowess, and ends with him leading the Franks to victory over the Saracens.
Stories about Ogier appeared in Icelandic, Castilian, Catalonian, and Italian.
