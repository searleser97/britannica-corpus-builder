Pixie, also spelled pixy,  in the folklore of southwestern England, tiny elflike spirit or mischievous fairy dressed in green who dances in the moonlight to the music of frogs and crickets. Its favourite pastimes are leading travelers astray and frightening young maidens. Pixies also delight in rapping on walls, blowing out candles, and playing in water. Pixies were first discussed at some length by British novelist Mrs. Anna Eliza Bray in The Borders of the Tamar and the Tavy, 3 vol. (1837).
Their prank of leading people astray gave rise to the terms pixie-led and pixilated to describe a person who becomes lost on a familiar road. It was later extended to mean any state of bewilderment or confusion.
