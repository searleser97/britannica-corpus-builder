Het Vrije Volk, (Dutch: “The Free People”)  former daily evening socialist newspaper, once one of the largest and most influential dailies in the Netherlands. It was established in 1900 as Het Volk (“The People”), the official organ of the Socialist Democratic Labour Party. During the German occupation of the Netherlands in World War II, it was suppressed by the Nazis, but it resumed publication in 1945 as Het Vrije Volk. It remained the voice of the Labour Party, retaining a strong political orientation. Het Vrije Volk and the communist De Waarheid (“The Truth”) were for a time the only daily newspapers in the Netherlands with permanent party affiliations. In 1991 the newspaper Rotterdams Dagblad resulted from the combination of Het Vrije Volk with Rotterdams Nieuwsblad.
