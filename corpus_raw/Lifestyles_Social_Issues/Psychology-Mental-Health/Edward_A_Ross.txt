Edward A. Ross, in full Edward Alsworth Ross,  (born Dec. 12, 1866, Virden, Illinois, U.S.—died  July 22, 1951, Madison, Wisconsin), a founder of sociology in the United States and one of the first sociologists to pursue a comprehensive sociological theory. Ross was also a prolific writer whose flair for popular presentation greatly stimulated interest in social science research. He was an advocate of melioristic sociology—the application of the discipline to the ends of social reform.
Ross received his B.A. from Coe College (1886) and his Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins University (1891). He joined the faculty at Stanford University in 1893 as professor of administration and finance but became more interested in sociology. His political views (he was an adherent of populism in U.S. politics) so antagonized Mrs. Leland Stanford, widow of the university’s founder, that she secured his dismissal in 1900. Ross then taught at the University of Wisconsin from 1906 until 1937.
His best-known work, Social Control (1901), on the reasons for and the means of societal limitation of the individual, was long regarded as a classic. Another widely read book by Ross was Social Psychology (1908), one of the first American works written specifically on that discipline. Sin and Society (1907) was his argument in favour of sociological jurisprudence. His Principles of Sociology (1920) was for years a standard introductory textbook.
