Kurt Lewin,  (born September 9, 1890, Mogilno, Germany [now in Poland]—died February 12, 1947, Newtonville, Massachusetts, U.S.), German-born American social psychologist known for his field theory of behaviour, which holds that human behaviour is a function of an individual’s psychological environment.
Lewin studied in Germany at Freiburg, Munich, and Berlin, receiving his doctorate from the University of Berlin in 1914. After serving in the German army during World War I, he joined the faculty of the Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute. In 1933 he moved to the United States and began work at the State University of Iowa’s Child Welfare Research Station (1935–45). In 1945 he founded and became director of the Research Center for Group Dynamics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge. He retained that position until his death.
Lewin proposed that human behaviour should be seen as part of a continuum, with individual variations from the norm being a function of tensions between perceptions of the self and of the environment. To fully understand and predict human behaviour, the whole psychological field, or “lifespace,” within which the person acted had to be viewed; the totality of events in this lifespace determined behaviour at any one time. Lewin attempted to reinforce his theories by using topological systems (maplike representations) to graphically depict psychological forces. He devoted the last years of his life to research on group dynamics, believing that groups alter the individual behaviour of their constituents. On the basis of research examining the effects of democratic, autocratic, and laissez-faire methods of leadership on groups of children, Lewin claimed that small groups operated most successfully when they were conducted in a democratic manner.
