The Royal College of Science was founded in 1845 by Prince Albert, the consort of Queen Victoria. The Royal School of Mines was founded in 1851, and the City and Guilds College was founded in 1884. The institutions united to form the Imperial College of Science and Technology in 1907 and became a school of the University of London in 1908. An act of Parliament in 1988 made St. Mary’s Hospital Medical School, founded in 1854, the college’s fourth school. The National Heart and Lung Institute was joined with the college in 1995, creating with St. Mary’s the new Imperial College School of Medicine. The Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School, as well as the Royal Postgraduate Medical School, were merged with the institution in 1997, and in 2000 it also merged with Wye College. In 2006 Imperial College withdrew from the University of London in order to become an independent university.
Imperial College London has a 240-acre (97-hectare) site with wetland, farmland, parkland, and laboratories at Silwood Park near Ascot, Berkshire; it also owns a mine near Truro, Cornwall.
