W.K. Kellogg Foundation,  U.S. philanthropic organization that funds community-based approaches to improving health and well-being, with a focus on child welfare. It was established in 1930 by W.K. Kellogg, the founder of a global ready-to-eat-cereal company and a noted philanthropist. The foundation’s headquarters is located in Battle Creek, Michigan.
The organization was originally named the W.K. Kellogg Child Welfare Foundation and focused its attention on the health needs of children living in Michigan’s rural communities by providing hearing tests, eye exams, immunizations, and school lunches under the aegis of its Michigan Community Health Project (MCHP). Since that time the foundation has provided seed funding and ongoing support for education service, and research in public health, including food security and health professions education as well as agriculture and community development. In keeping with Kellogg’s intention to use a portion of his fortune to help people help themselves, its priorities have consistently leaned toward empowerment strategies and sustainable development. The foundation’s work soon expanded beyond Michigan to include other states, such as Louisiana, Mississippi, and New Mexico. It also has an international presence, funding projects around the globe in places such as Mexico, Brazil, Haiti, and countries in Southern Africa.
