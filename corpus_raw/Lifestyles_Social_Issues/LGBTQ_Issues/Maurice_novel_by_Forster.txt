Maurice,  novel by E.M. Forster, published posthumously in 1971. Because of the work’s homosexual theme, the novel was published only after Forster’s death.
Maurice Hall, a student at the University of Cambridge, reaches maturity and self-awareness when he accepts his homosexuality and also renounces the bourgeois values in which he has always believed. He further resolves his conflicts about class consciousness when he takes as a lover Alec Scudder, a gamekeeper.
