Jim Inhofe, in full James Mountain Inhofe,  (born November 17, 1934, Des Moines, Iowa, U.S.), American politician who was elected as a Republican to the U.S. Senate in 1994 and began representing Oklahoma in that body later that year. He previously served as mayor of Tulsa, Oklahoma (1978–84), and as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives (1987–94).
Although he was born in Iowa, Inhofe grew up in Tulsa. After a stint in the U.S. Army (1957–58), he went into business, working as a land developer, an aviation executive, and an insurance executive, including a period as president of the now-defunct Quaker Life Insurance Company. During that time he married (1959) Kay Kirkpatrick, and the couple later had four children. While pursuing various work opportunities, Inhofe also was a member of the state legislature, serving in the House of Representatives (1967–69) and the Senate (1969–77). He entered college in his mid-30s and graduated from the University of Tulsa with a bachelor’s degree in economics in 1973. The following year he ran for governor of the state but lost. After an unsuccessful bid for the U.S. House of Representatives, Inhofe became mayor of Tulsa in 1978. He was reelected twice before leaving office in 1984. Two years later he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, where he served from 1987 to 1994. He was a noteworthy opponent of Pres. Ronald Reagan’s 1987 budget, which raised taxes after many earlier protestations that tax increases were not forthcoming while at the same time slightly reducing military spending.
In 1994 Inhofe ran for the U.S. Senate in a special election and won, taking office later that year. While in Congress, Inhofe established himself as a conservative, consistently voting to the farthest right of the Republican Party. An outspoken skeptic of climate change, Inhofe wrote The Greatest Hoax: How the Global Warming Conspiracy Threatens Your Future (2012), and he compared the Environmental Protection Agency to the Gestapo. On social issues, he was a vocal opponent of marriage equality and abortion. Inhofe came under criticism for voting against funding federal disaster-relief efforts in the aftermath of hurricanes along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts while voting for federal relief for victims of natural disasters in his own state.
