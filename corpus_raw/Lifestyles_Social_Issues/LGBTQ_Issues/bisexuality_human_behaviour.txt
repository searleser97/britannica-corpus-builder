Bisexuality,   in human sexuality, sexual interest in and attraction to members of oneâ€™s own and the opposite sex. A bisexual is thus a person with both heterosexual and homosexual desires. Some clinical surveys suggest that a significant number of persons experience bisexual desires and engage in bisexual activity. As the tolerance of homosexual behaviour increased in many societies in the late 20th century, the number of people identifying themselves as bisexual also increased.
