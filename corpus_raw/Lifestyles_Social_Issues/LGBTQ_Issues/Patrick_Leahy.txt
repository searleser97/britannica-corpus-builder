Patrick Leahy, in full Patrick Joseph Leahy,  (born March 31, 1940, Montpelier, Vermont, U.S.), American politician who was elected as a Democrat to the U.S. Senate in 1974 and began representing Vermont the following year.
Leahy, who was born blind in one eye, graduated from Saint Michael’s College in 1961. The following year he married Marcelle Pomerleau, and the couple later had three children. After studying law at Georgetown University (J.D., 1964), he returned to his home state of Vermont, where he eventually became a state’s attorney (1966–74) and gained a reputation as a tough prosecutor. In 1974 Leahy ran for the U.S. Senate. Buoyed by a widespread antipathy toward Republican candidates in the wake of Pres. Richard M. Nixon’s resignation from office, he was the first Democratic candidate to win a Senate seat from Vermont. He was also the youngest senator in the state’s history.
After taking office in 1975, Leahy earned a reputation as a liberal, though his voting record was often moderate. He assumed a leadership role in health insurance reform and in the push for marriage equality. He also took a strong interest in technology. With Republican Rep. Lamar Smith, he cowrote the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (2011), which was called the most significant reform of U.S. patent law in the modern era; it established priority for inventions by filing date rather than by first demonstration. In addition, Leahy propounded legislation that protected data and intellectual property. As one of the few senators to vote against the reauthorization of the USA PATRIOT Act in 2006, he introduced or cosponsored numerous bills that sought to limit electronic surveillance by the government.
