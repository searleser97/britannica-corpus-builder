Foreign Affairs,  journal of international relations, published in New York City six times a year, one of the most prestigious periodicals of its kind in the world. The organ of the Council on Foreign Relations, by which it was founded in 1922, it provides a window on the U.S. foreign-policy establishment. It has an international reputation for its careful and probing analyses of political, economic, and social developments on the world scene. The contributors of these authoritative and scholarly articles are among the country’s most distinguished journalists, scholars, and statesmen. Ideas put forward in this journal, if well received by the Foreign Affairs community, often reappeared later as U.S. government policy or legislation; prospective policies failing this “test” have often disappeared.
