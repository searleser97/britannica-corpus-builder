Consumer Reports,  monthly American magazine providing original reviews of a wide range of consumer products. The publication has been a source of impartial product ratings for consumers. The magazine, published by the nonprofit organization Consumers Union, first appeared in 1936. A Web version has been available to subscribers since 1987. The magazine’s combined print and electronic readership exceeded six million at the turn of the 21st century.
Consumer Reports has been a significant factor in building consumer awareness among Americans, and its findings have prompted the creation of government safety commissions and the passage of regulations on various industries. In 1953 the magazine was the first public source to introduce consumers to the contents of cigarettes. Other significant reports included a series on the contamination of community drinking-water systems, for which Consumer Reports won its first National Magazine Award in 1975. Additional awards were received in 1987, 1990, and 2004. Because the magazine reaches millions of consumers, several lawsuits have been brought against Consumers Union by manufacturers whose products were given a negative review in the magazine. Faulty data reported in the magazine in 1998, 2006, and 2007 also sparked some debate over the organization’s testing procedures.
To maintain objectivity in its product reviews, Consumers Union does not accept free samples, advertising, or outside funding. Undercover shoppers purchase products to be analyzed by technical experts at the organization’s testing facilities in Yonkers, N.Y. The organization also employs a substantial staff of lobbyists and activists in an ongoing effort to influence legislation to protect consumer interests. An annual questionnaire and an April auto edition have been the publication’s best-selling issues. Companion publications of Consumer Reports include Consumer Reports on Health and Consumer Reports Money Advisor.
