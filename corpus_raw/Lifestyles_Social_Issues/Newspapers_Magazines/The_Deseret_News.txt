The Deseret News,  daily newspaper published in Salt Lake City, Utah, by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons). It was founded as a biweekly in 1850. The word Deseret means “Land of the Honey Bee,” according to the Book of Mormon, and was to have been the name of the anticipated Mormon state. The Deseret News was forced to move from Salt Lake City to Fillmore, Utah, during the armed conflicts of 1857–58. Partly because newsprint was scarce, The Deseret News did not become a daily until 1867. It is one of the few successful religious dailies in the English language. In addition to church news The Deseret News carries world news, much of it from news agencies.
