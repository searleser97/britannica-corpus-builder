El País, (Spanish: “The Country”)  daily newspaper published in Madrid, an independent paper dedicated to the promotion of democratic ideals in post-Franco Spain.
Established in 1976, it was enthusiastically received from the start. The idea of founding such a journal originated with the son of the philosopher José Ortega y Gasset, and he set up the company in 1972. The venture was approved by the government about the time of Franco’s death, and six months later the first issue appeared.
El País set out to be a highly readable, serious, literate national newspaper appealing to diverse interests and schools of political thought. It covers local, national, and international news thoroughly and offers sections on culture and society, sports, and business and finance.
