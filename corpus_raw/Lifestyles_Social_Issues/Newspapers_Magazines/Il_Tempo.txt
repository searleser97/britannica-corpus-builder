Il Tempo, (Italian: “Time”)  morning daily newspaper published in Rome, one of Italy’s outstanding newspapers and one with broad appeal and influence in the Roman region. It was founded in 1944 by Renato Angiolillo as a conservative paper with a strong anticommunist bias. Il Tempo quickly became recognized as a serious morning daily with excellent, balanced news coverage. It has maintained its independence of political parties, and, because its operation has been profitable, it has been able to remain largely independent of the direct commercial or industrial subsidies common in Italy.
