Haʾaretz, (Hebrew: “The Land”)  newspaper, published in Tel Aviv, that is Israel’s oldest daily and generally considered the country’s highest-quality newspaper.
Haʾaretz was founded in Jerusalem in 1919 as an independent liberal paper in the tradition of Russian-Hebrew journalism and moved to Tel Aviv in 1923. Bought by Salman Schocken in 1937, the newspaper was edited and published by his son, Gershom, from 1939 until his death, in 1990. Gershom’s son Amos subsequently became the newspaper’s publisher.
Haʾaretz’s influence and prestige are second to none in Israel, and it has maintained an active independent stance, attacking government and societal abuses throughout its history. Its readers include the leaders of every sector of Israeli society. The paper is noted for its balanced and sober approach to national, international, and regional news, its cosmopolitan flavour, and its general lack of bias in reporting. Haʾaretz is one of only a few Israeli daily newspapers not aligned with a political party and is respected for its independence. It has foreign correspondents in major world capitals. It is published in print and online in Hebrew; in 1997 it began publishing an English-language version.
