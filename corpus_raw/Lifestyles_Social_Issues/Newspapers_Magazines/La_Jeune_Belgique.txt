La Jeune Belgique,  (“Young Belgium”), influential review (1881–97), edited by poet and novelist Max Waller; it gave its name to a literary movement (though never a formal “school”) that aimed to express a genuinely Belgian consciousness and to free the literature of Belgium from outworn Romanticism. Among writers associated with the movement were Maurice Maeterlinck, Émile Verhaeren, and Max Elskamp—all poets of international stature.
