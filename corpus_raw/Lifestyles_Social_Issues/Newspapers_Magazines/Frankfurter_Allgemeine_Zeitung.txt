Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, (German: “Frankfurt General Newspaper”) , abbreviation F.A.Z.,  daily newspaper published in Frankfurt am Main, one of the most prestigious and influential in Germany.
F.A.Z. was created after World War II by a group of journalists who had worked on the highly respected Frankfurter Zeitung before the war. The earlier paper was suppressed by Adolf Hitler in 1943, and under the Allied occupation forces another paper, the Allgemeine Zeitung, was started. When control of the press was turned over to the new West German government in 1949, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung began publication, pledging truth, objectivity, and fair treatment of opposing viewpoints. It became the first West German daily of truly national scope, and it quickly won a reputation for responsible reporting.
F.A.Z. is well respected for its independence and eclecticism. In the early 21st century, daily circulation exceeded 400,000. An English-language version, F.A.Z. Weekly, is published as a supplement to the International Herald Tribune.
