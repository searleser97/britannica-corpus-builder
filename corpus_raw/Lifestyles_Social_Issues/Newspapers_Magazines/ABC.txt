ABC,  tabloid daily newspaper published in Madrid and long regarded as one of Spain’s leading papers. It was founded as a weekly in 1903 by journalist Torcuato Luca de Tena y Alvarez-Ossorio, who later (1929) was made the marqués de Luca de Tena by King Alfonso XIII in recognition of his accomplishments with ABC. The paper became a daily in 1905 and after 1929 published a Seville edition.
ABC was monarchist in orientation from its founding, and during the Spanish Civil War it was taken over by the Republican government—nominally in 1931 and then, after several months’ suspension in 1932 and continued resistance to censorship, completely in 1936. It returned to private control, and, although it supported the dictatorial regime of Francisco Franco, it remained critical of government excesses.
ABC has always been noted for its graphics; it was a heavy user of photography from its inception, and the front page is typically an action photograph that covers nearly the entire page. In more recent times, the paper has won wide acclaim for its coverage of Spanish culture and the arts. By the end of the 20th century, its daily circulation had reached about 335,000.
