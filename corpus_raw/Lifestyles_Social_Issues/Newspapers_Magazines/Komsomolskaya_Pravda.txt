Komsomolskaya Pravda, (Russian: “Young Communist League Truth”)  morning daily newspaper published in Moscow that was the official voice of the Central Council of the Komsomol, or communist youth league, for young people aged 14 to 28. Komsomolskaya Pravda was founded in 1925 and historically had its main offices in Moscow, with those of Pravda, the Communist Party daily newspaper, but with its own editorial staff.
In 1953 Komsomolskaya Pravda began to use a livelier layout and a greater variety of material. Under its then editor, Nikita S. Khrushchev’s son-in-law, Alexei Adzhubei, it introduced more travel articles, sports pieces, and short fiction and reduced the amount of propaganda. At its peak in the 1970s and early ’80s, Komsomolskaya Pravda had a circulation of more than 15 million. The newspaper continued after the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991.
