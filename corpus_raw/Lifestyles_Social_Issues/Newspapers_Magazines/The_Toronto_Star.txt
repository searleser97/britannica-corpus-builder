The Toronto Star,  influential Canadian newspaper established in 1892 as the Evening Star by 25 printers who had lost their jobs in a labour dispute. A four-page paper at the outset, it changed hands several times until 1899, when a group of leading citizens bought the paper and Joseph E. Atkinson took over its direction. The paper was renamed The Toronto Daily Star, and within five years its circulation rose from 7,000 to 40,000.
Liberal in editorial outlook, the Star in the early 20th century pressed for unemployment insurance, old-age pensions, and other social changes. It promoted stronger Canadian nationhood and a greater presence in international affairs. It established its own radio station, CFCA, in 1922. Its outspoken opposition to Nazi policies in Germany made it the first North American newspaper to be banned from Nazi Germany.
