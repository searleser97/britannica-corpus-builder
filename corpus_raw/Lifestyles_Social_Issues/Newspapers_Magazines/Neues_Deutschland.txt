Neues Deutschland, (German: “New Germany”)  morning daily newspaper published in Germany. Headquarters are in Berlin.
Neues Deutschland initially functioned as the official organ of the Central Committee of the Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands (SED;  Socialist Unity Party of Germany) in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) and was the largest daily in that country; after German reunification in 1990, it was partly owned by the SED’s descendant, the Party of Democratic Socialism, later renamed the Left Party. Called the “German Pravda” because it imitated the Soviet newspaper so faithfully in both style and content, Neues Deutschland—established in East Berlin in 1945—consistently presented news, interpretation, and educational and polemical material in strict conformity to current Soviet communist doctrines and positions. Starting in 1953, when popular uprisings swept East Germany, a liberalizing trend was visible in the pages of Neues Deutschland, but by 1958 it had reverted to its traditional role in the development of party unity.
Early in its history, Neues Deutschland began to accept some display advertising, but it never became an important element in the East German press in general. The paper’s makeup, very austere and even drab in its first issues, was livened considerably with varied headline styles and photographs. In the early 1980s, its circulation was in excess of one million. After reunification, however, its readership significantly declined, although it nonetheless maintained a socialist voice. In 2007 the newspaper began publishing an online edition.
