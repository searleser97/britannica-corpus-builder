Svenska Dagbladet, (Swedish: “Swedish Daily Paper”)  morning daily newspaper published in Stockholm, one of the most influential papers in Sweden and one that was editorially aligned with the centre-right Moderate Party.
Founded in 1884, Svenska Dagbladet was operated from 1940 to 1973 under the ownership of a foundation supported by a number of Swedish business firms and other segments of society, including the church and the armed forces. This was reorganized in 1973 to provide more support from industry and to make it possible for papers with a small circulation to continue to operate. The Swedish government partly subsidizes Svenska Dagbladet, but the paper is considered independent and remains the strongest voice of conservatism in a liberal political environment.
