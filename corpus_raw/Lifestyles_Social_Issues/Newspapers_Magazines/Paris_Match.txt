Paris Match,  weekly pictorial magazine published in France since 1949 as successor to L’Illustration (1843–1944), which was discredited during World War II. A popular news and current-events magazine aimed at the middle class, Paris Match features picture stories on public affairs, profiles and interviews of government officials and assorted celebrities, and stories on entertainment, fashion, and consumer products. In its early decades it was often compared to the American magazine Life (1936–72), which it far outlived.
Paris Match was acquired by Jean Prouvost, publisher of the daily Le Figaro, and he led the magazine to high prestige and financial success. Its ownership eventually passed, by the early 21st century, to the French conglomerate Lagardère. Paris Match appeals to a broad spectrum of the French people and is one of the most widely circulated magazines in France.
