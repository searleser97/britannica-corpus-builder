Helsingin Sanomat, (Finnish:  “Helsinki News”)  morning daily newspaper published in Helsinki, the largest paper in Finland and the only one of substance that remains free of political-party control.
The newspaper was founded in 1889 by Eero Erkko as the Päivälehti. In 1904 it was suppressed, but it resumed publication some months later. Its progressive stance and independent-liberal policy attracted writers who gave the paper a vigorous tone even while Finland was ruled by Russia (until 1917). Eljas Erkko, the son of the founder, assumed directorship of the paper in 1927, and, after his death in 1965, the paper remained in family hands, which has enabled it to maintain its independent stance. The Helsingin Sanomat’s foreign coverage is among the best in the world, and its presentation tends to be unbiased and balanced. In 1998 it claimed a circulation of 472,056, the country’s largest.
