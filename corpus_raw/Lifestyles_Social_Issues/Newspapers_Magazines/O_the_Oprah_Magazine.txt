O, the Oprah Magazine,  former monthly American women’s magazine created by celebrity talk-show host Oprah Winfrey and published by Hearst Magazines. Through a combination of motivational stories, inspirational quotes, book reviews, and intimate celebrity interviews, the oversized magazine built on the success of Winfrey’s popular talk show.
Within months of its launch in 2000, O was outselling top American women’s magazines, with a circulation of more than two million. In 2001 the monthly publication was lauded as the best start-up magazine and one of the best magazines of the year. By 2008 O claimed a readership of more than 16 million. The first international edition was launched in South Africa in 2002, and in 2004 a quarterly sister publication, O at Home, was introduced, though it folded in 2008.
The magazine highlighted personal growth and empowerment but also included articles on fashion, fitness, food, and relationships. Relying heavily on the selling power of her stardom, every issue featured Winfrey on its cover—except for the September 2020 edition, which had Breonna Taylor, an African American woman killed during a botched police raid—a unique strategy among American women’s magazines. Winfrey’s close involvement with the publication inspired its editorial content and shaped all aspects of its design.
In 2020 it was announced that O would cease its print editions, and the December issue was the magazine’s last. The following year O was rebranded. Oprah Daily became the digital product, and O Quarterly, a print edition published four times a year, was launched. In addition, Oprah Insider, a subscription site, debuted in 2021.
