Mainichi shimbun, (Japanese: “Daily Newspaper”)  national daily newspaper, one of Japan’s “big three” dailies, which publishes morning and evening editions in Tokyo, Ōsaka, and three other regional centres.
The newspaper had as its origin the Nihon Rikken Seitō shimbun (“Japan Constitutional Government Party Newspaper”), which was first published by the Rikken Seitō in 1882. In 1888 it became the Ōsaka mainichi shimbun. In 1903 the newspaper came under the control of industrialist Motoyama Hikoichi, and in 1911 it commenced publication under the title Mainichi shimbun.
With its thorough coverage and generally progressive editorial outlook, Mainichi has appealed to a largely middle-class readership; since the 1970s it has had a steady circulation of more than five million. It is usually ranked second to Asahi shimbun as regards national and international prestige, but it appears with its rival on most experts’ lists of the world’s greatest newspapers. It has a combined staff at its various plants of more than 6,000 people, including reporters, editors, and translators of foreign news. Mainichi, like other Japanese papers, publishes proportionately much more foreign news than most Western papers.
