Ananda Bazar Patrika,  morning daily Bengali-language newspaper published in Kolkata (Calcutta). One of Indiaâ€™s largest non-English-language newspapers in terms of circulation, Ananda Bazar Patrika was founded in 1922 and is something of a rarity among newspapers in Indian languages, most of which do not attain circulations of more than a few thousand. The newspaper, which also publishes an Allahabad edition, had one of the highest circulations of single-edition dailies in India, reaching nearly 500,000 before the end of the 20th century. Other Indian daily newspapers of this size, such as the Hindustan Times and the Times of India, are published in English.
