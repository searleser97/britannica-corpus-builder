Novy Mir,   (Russian: “New World”), literary journal, a highly influential monthly published in Moscow. Founded in 1925, it was an official organ of the Writers’ Union of the U.S.S.R. Its pages carried the work of many of the Soviet Union’s leading writers, and a good number of them were either censured or denied further publication there for expressing impermissible political views. Under the liberal editorship of Aleksandr Tvardovsky (1958–70), Novy Mir was the first to publish Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn’s novel One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich (1962). The censorship of the magazine in the 1970s and ’80s contributed to the development of a large underground press in the Soviet Union. Novy Mir still features literary criticism and commentary concerning the problems of contemporary Russian literature, and occasional analysis of domestic and international political issues.
