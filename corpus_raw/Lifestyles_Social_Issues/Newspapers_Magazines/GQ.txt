GQ, formerly (1931–57) Apparel Arts and (1958–83) Gentlemen’s Quarterly,  men’s fashion magazine that was started as a trade publication in New York City in 1931 and became available to the general public in 1957.
Apparel Arts was marketed to men’s clothing wholesalers and retailers, providing them with fashion information and helping them make recommendations to male customers. The publishers of Apparel Arts started Esquire, a publically distributed men’s magazine, in 1933. In 1957 it was transformed into a quarterly fashion supplement for Esquire subscribers. It resumed separate publication under the single title Gentlemen’s Quarterly in 1958. The special-interest fashion magazine was sold to Condé Nast Publications in 1983, and its name was shortened to GQ. Art Cooper, GQ’s editor-in-chief, expanded the magazine’s focus beyond fashion, making it a general men’s magazine. The newly defined publication came into direct competition with Esquire, and GQ outsold its competitor for the first time in 1993.
GQ was revamped again in 2003 to compete with the British “lad” magazines FHM and Maxim. Marketed to a younger readership (ages 18 to 30), the magazine began following trends in pop culture more closely and including shorter news articles in addition to its traditional in-depth essays and profiles.
GQ is known for its relative sophistication among men’s style and culture magazines. In addition to fashion, the magazine covers politics, travel, entertainment, sports, technology, food and wine, fitness, health, and relationships. GQ often includes features about movie stars, professional athletes, and rock musicians. The magazine also presents annual “GQ Men of the Year” awards to recognize the most influential men in a variety of fields.
