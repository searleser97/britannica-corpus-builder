The Courier-Journal,  morning daily newspaper published in Louisville, Kentucky, long recognized as one of the outstanding regional newspapers of the United States.
It was founded in 1868 by a merger of the Louisville Courier and the Louisville Journal brought about by Henry Watterson, The Courier-Journalâ€™s first editor, who also became a part owner. Watterson was an eloquent writer and a veteran of the Confederate army in the Civil War who greatly admired Abraham Lincoln and who believed in political participation by blacks. His half-century tenure as editor brought The Courier-Journal nationwide distinction for its thorough coverage and for having the strength of its sometimes unpopular convictions. It was a leading voice in the creation of what eventually became known as the New South.
Liberal and Democratic in its editorial outlook, The Courier-Journal supported progressive causes while stressing national and international news coverage. Under Watterson, and later under the Bingham family, it was an influential force in Democratic Party presidential nominations and in the politics of the state and region. Its support of equal rights and opportunities for blacks, progressive in the context of southern politics, was as conspicuous in the 1960s and 1970s as it had been 100 years before during the Reconstruction era. The newspaper was purchased by the Gannett Co., Inc., in 1986.
