The Woman Citizen,  American weekly periodical, one of the most influential women’s publications of the early decades of the 20th century. It came into existence as a result of a substantial bequest from Mrs. Frank Leslie to Carrie Chapman Catt, the head of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). According to the terms of the bequest, the money was to be used to further the cause of woman suffrage. Accordingly, Catt founded The Woman Citizen in 1917 by merging three suffrage journals, the Woman’s Journal, the National Suffrage News, and Woman Voter. Rose Young was the journal’s editor in chief, and Alice Stone Blackwell, the former editor of the Woman’s Journal, was a contributing editor. The bequest ensured that the Citizen remained solvent and that it was able to reach a wide and influential audience. Every congressman was added to the mailing list free of charge.
Winning the enfranchisement of American women was always at the forefront of the Citizen’s mission, but the publication also reported on such issues as child labour and the status of woman suffrage around the world. After American women won the vote in 1920, the Citizen continued publication, redirecting its editorial agenda to the political education of women. By the late 1920s the money from the bequest was running low. The publication changed its name to the Woman’s Journal, hoping that such a name would imply a broader scope and attract more subscribers. Circulation did improve following the name change, but the onset of the Great Depression forced the Journal to fold in 1931.
