Daily Worker,  newspaper that, under a variety of names, has generally reflected the views of the Communist Party of the United States.
The Daily Worker, its origins traceable to the 1920s, was variously the organ and the “semiofficial” voice of the party, and its readers across the middle of the 20th century included numerous U.S. government intelligence agents, who also monitored its list of subscribers. In 1958 the paper became a weekly under the title of The Worker. A decade later it returned to daily publication (Tuesday through Saturday) and was renamed the Daily World, partly in an attempt to broaden its audience. It covered societal developments and labour news, with editorials and political commentary reflecting the views of the Communist Party. (In the United Kingdom the similarly oriented Daily Worker was published in London and for similar reasons was renamed the Morning Star.)
In 1986 the American newspaper’s name changed to People’s Daily World, and in 1999 it was renamed People’s Weekly World so as to signal its shift to weekly publication; that year it had a circulation of about 40,000. In 2010 the newspaper moved to online-only daily publication under the name People’s World.
