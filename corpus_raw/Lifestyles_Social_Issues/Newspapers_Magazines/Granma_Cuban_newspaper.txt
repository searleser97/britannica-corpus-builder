Granma,  daily newspaper published in Havana, the official organ of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba. The paper takes its name from the yacht that carried Fidel Castro and others supporting his revolution from Mexico to Cuba in 1956. Granma was established in 1965 by the merger of what then were the two major, and rival, newspapers, Hoy (Spanish: “Today”), the organ of the Communist Party of Cuba, and the daily newspaper of Castro’s 26th of July movement, Revolución. In addition to daily editions in Spanish, Granma publishes weekly editions in French and in English. It publishes on the Internet in Spanish, English, French, Portuguese, German, and Italian.
