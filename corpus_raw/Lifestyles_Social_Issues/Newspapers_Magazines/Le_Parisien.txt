Le Parisien, (French: “The Parisian”)  morning daily newspaper published in Paris, one of the largest and most influential in France. Formerly called Le Parisien Libéré (“The Free Parisian”), it was established in Paris in 1944 as an organ of the French underground during the latter part of the German occupation in World War II. The paper used a sensational makeup style with numerous headlines and photos on its front page and with the text of news articles often confined to inside pages.
After the war Le Parisien Libéré successfully competed with the welter of new dailies, and by the 1960s it had the second largest circulation in France. Faced with union difficulties and mounting costs, the paper’s owner, Emilien Amaury, in 1975 moved the printing operations of Le Parisien Libéré to Saint-Ouen and Chartres. The union problems were settled in 1977, but the readership of Le Parisien Libéré had dropped somewhat. By the mid-1980s it had regained popularity, and, in the early 21st century, Le Parisien (the word Libéré was dropped in 1986) was one of the most widely read newspapers in France, reaching more than 350,000. The newspaper’s national edition, Aujourd’hui, was launched in 1994.
