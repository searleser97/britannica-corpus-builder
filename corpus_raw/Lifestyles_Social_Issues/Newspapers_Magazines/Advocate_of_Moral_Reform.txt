Advocate of Moral Reform,  American  periodical that, between 1835 and about 1845, campaigned to rescue women who were victims of moral and physical corruption and to reassert woman’s centrality to family life.
First published in New York City in 1835, the Advocate of Moral Reform gained some 20,000 subscribers over the next few years. Serving as a voice for members of the moral reform movement, the journal’s mission was to bring a moral centre back to the group of women who had passed beyond the influence of ministers and family and into morally compromised situations. Using a variety of tactics to encourage wayward girls and fallen women to repudiate their ways, the Advocate also waged significant campaigns to check masculine seductive power over women, at times going so far as to print reports exposing individual seducers and lechers from particular communities.
As both external and internal pressures increasingly questioned the methods of moral-reform activism, the Advocate began to temper its stance on the issue, choosing to focus on the influence of women within the home. Increasing efforts to foster effective education and family values, the periodical—along with the movement itself—came to recognize the limitations of the vigilant moral reform campaign. As is evident from the reaction to an article written by abolitionist Sarah Grimké in 1838, many readers were committed to the cause of moral enlightenment, but most women ultimately were forced to rely on male authority figures. When asked by Grimké to overthrow clerical dominance and end the “degradation and bondage” enforced on women by men, the response from Advocate readers was a resounding “No.” Slowly the movement was overtaken by a growing focus on emancipation, and in the mid-1840s the journal ceased publication.
