Cosmopolitan, byname Cosmo,  monthly magazine for women, with more than 50 international editions. The advertisement-heavy magazine features short fiction pieces and advice-oriented articles on relationships, sex, fashion, entertainment, and careers.
The Cosmopolitan Magazine was launched by the publisher Schlicht & Field Company in 1886 as a family journal of fashion, household decor, cooking, and other domestic interests. Two years later Schlicht & Field’s bankruptcy forced it to sell the magazine to Joseph Newton Hallock, who introduced book reviews and serialized fiction to its pages. John Brisben Walker took over the publication in 1889, expanding its circulation from 20,000 to 400,000. Walker’s Cosmopolitan became a popular American literary magazine, featuring poetry, travel essays, and short stories with a strong focus on education and social reform. In 1905 Cosmopolitan was acquired by the publishing tycoon William Randolph Hearst. After a brief period of muckraking, the magazine adopted a format consisting of short fiction as well as articles on celebrities and public affairs, and it expanded its circulation to two million by 1940.
When Helen Gurley Brown, author of Sex and the Single Girl (1962), became Cosmopolitan’s first female editor in 1965, the failing magazine was given a dramatic makeover. Under a new motto—“fun, fearless, female”—it began to focus exclusively on the interests of young women. Its coverage of premarital sex, birth control, and corporate careers sparked scandal in the 1960s, but Brown’s relentless, frank approach to the “Cosmo girl” lifestyle contributed to the gradual transformation of cultural norms. In later decades the magazine was criticized by feminists and social conservatives alike, but dozens of fashion and lifestyle publications emerged to imitate Brown’s enormously successful formula.
