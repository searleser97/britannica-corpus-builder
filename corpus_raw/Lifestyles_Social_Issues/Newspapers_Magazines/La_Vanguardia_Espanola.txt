La Vanguardia Española,  (Spanish: “The Spanish Vanguard”), morning daily newspaper published in Barcelona, one of the largest and most influential newspapers in Spain. It was established in 1881 by Carlos Godó, in whose family it remained, as a political organ favouring the policies of Práxedes Mateo Sagasta, the leader of a liberal political coalition. In its early years La Vanguardia was hampered by press censorship. Ramon Godó Lallana assumed direction of the paper in 1897 and began to build it into a leading national daily. La Vanguardia Española operated with little government interference in the early part of the 20th century but came again under official control following the fall of the Spanish monarchy in 1931. The paper’s political outlook is liberal. It is noted for its coverage of international news—it has more foreign correspondents than any other Spanish journal—and for its sports reporting. The paper was a pioneer in progressive labour policies, early providing such employee benefits as sick pay, paid vacations, and pensions. In the late 20th century its circulation was about 190,000 daily and 250,000 Sunday.
