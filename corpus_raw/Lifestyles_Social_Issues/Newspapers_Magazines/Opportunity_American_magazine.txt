Opportunity, in full Opportunity: Journal Of Negro Life,  American magazine associated with the Harlem Renaissance, published from 1923 to 1949. The editor, Charles S. Johnson, aimed to give voice to black culture, hitherto neglected by mainstream American publishing.
To encourage young writers to submit their work, Johnson sponsored three literary contests. In 1925 the winners included Zora Neale Hurston, Langston Hughes, and Countee Cullen. Ebony and Topaz, A Collectanea (1927) was an anthology of the best works published in the magazine.
