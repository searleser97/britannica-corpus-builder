La Presse, (French: “The Press”)  French-language daily newspaper published in Montreal. It has long been one of the most widely circulated French-language daily newspapers in Canada, and it remains the biggest standard-size (broadsheet) paper; only the French-language tabloid Le Journal de Montréal has a larger circulation. The paper was established in 1884.
La Presse is highly regarded as a comprehensive, thorough daily. In the early 21st century, its weekday circulation exceeded 180,000, which ranked it among the larger Canadian papers in either French or English.
