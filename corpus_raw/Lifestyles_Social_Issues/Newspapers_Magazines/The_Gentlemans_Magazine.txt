The Gentleman’s Magazine,  (1731–1914), long-popular English periodical that gave the name “magazine” to its genre. It was the first general periodical in England, founded by Edward Cave in 1731. It originated as a storehouse, or magazine, of essays and articles culled from other publications, often from books and pamphlets. Its motto—“E pluribus unum”—took note of the numerous sources scoured to assemble one monthly issue. Samuel Johnson joined The Gentleman’s Magazine in 1738, and a short time later it began to publish parliamentary reports and original writing.
