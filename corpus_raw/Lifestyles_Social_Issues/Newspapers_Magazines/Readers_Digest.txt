Reader’s Digest,  U.S.-based monthly magazine, having probably the largest circulation of any periodical in the world. It was first published in 1922 as a digest of condensed articles of topical interest and entertainment value taken from other periodicals. Founded on a low budget by DeWitt Wallace and his wife, Lila Acheson, after numerous magazine publishers had rejected the idea, the pocket-size magazine appealed from the start to popular tastes. It began publishing condensed versions of current books in 1934. Later Wallace began to develop articles for Reader’s Digest by commissioning them first and then offering the completed articles to other publications—from which the Digest would then reprint them, paying the other magazine a fee for reprint rights. This practice was attacked by some editors. However, the Digest moved gradually toward publishing original material under its own auspices most of the time. Although conceived by Wallace as an impartial journal, the Digest was occasionally criticized for reflecting its publishers’ generally conservative point of view. Its circulation, however, did not falter. By the late 20th century the Digest had 39 editions worldwide in 15 languages, with a total circulation of 28 million.
