Shirakaba, (Japanese: “White Birch”)  humanistic literary journal (1910–23) founded by a loose association of writers, art critics, artists, and others—among them Shiga Naoya, Arishima Takeo, and Mushanokōji Saneatsu—who together had attended the elite Peers’ School (Gakushūin) in Tokyo. The members of this group, called Shirakaba-ha (“White Birch School”), rejected the Confucian worldview and the naturalism of the earlier generation and had little patience with Japanese traditions. Shirakaba was perhaps the most identifiable means by which they expressed their eagerness for new styles of expression. The visual artists among them were especially interested in German Expressionism, Post-Impressionism, and other avant-garde movements of the West. All worked to spread the ideologies of individualism, idealism, and humanitarianism—largely derived from the writings of Leo Tolstoy—throughout Japanese society. The activities of the Shirakaba-ha included not only publication of the journal but art exhibitions and even social experiments, such as the Atarashiki Mura (“New Village”) movement, a utopian community designed to incorporate artistic activities into the everyday physical labour required of its inhabitants.
The contents of Shirakaba reflected the broad concerns of its supporters; it included criticism and fiction as well as illustrations and photographs. Because the movement gained momentum at a time when such Chinese intellectuals as Lu Xun and his younger brother Zhou Zuoren were studying in Japan, it also had a profound influence on China’s May Fourth Movement.
