The Times of India,  English-language morning daily newspaper published in Mumbai, Ahmadabad, and Delhi. It is one of India’s most influential papers, and its voice has frequently coincided with that of the national government.
Originally called The Bombay Times and Journal of Commerce, the paper was founded in 1838 to serve the British residents of western India. At first published twice weekly, the paper became a daily in 1851 and changed its name to The Times of India in 1861.
After Indian independence The Times’s insistence on accuracy, its avoidance of sensationalism, its serious tone, and its coverage of international news enhanced its prestige in India, where over the years it became known as an intellectual newspaper. Its coverage of international news, like that of the other great Indian dailies, is thorough, accounting for a quarter of its editorial space. It circulates nationally and covers a broad range of subject matter with attractive makeup and a readable style.
