Allgemeine Zeitung, (German: “General Newspaper”)  the greatest German newspaper in the 19th century, founded at Tübingen in 1798 by Johann Friedrich Cotta, later Freiherr (baron) von Cottendorf. Censorship and other pressures forced it to move successively to Stuttgart, Ulm, Augsburg, and Munich. The name has been carried on in a sense by the Frankfurter Allgemeine and the Westdeutsche Allgemeine of Essen, together with the Süddeutsche Zeitung of Munich—all leading newspapers of Germany.
