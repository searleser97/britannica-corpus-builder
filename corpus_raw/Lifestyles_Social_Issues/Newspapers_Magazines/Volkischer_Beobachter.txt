Völkischer Beobachter,   (German: “People’s Observer”), daily newspaper published by the Nazi Party in Germany from the 1920s until the fall of the Third Reich in 1945. The paper was originally founded in 1887 as a four-page Munich weekly, the Münchner Beobachter. It had become a daily anti-Semitic gossip sheet with a circulation of about 7,000 when it was bought by Adolph Hitler in 1923 to serve as the propaganda organ of his Nazi Party. In 1941 its circulation had passed 1.1 million.
Publication of the Völkischer Beobachter was suspended three times in the early 1920s by the pre-Hitler German government because of anti-Semitic articles and attacks on government policies and officials. After the third suspension it resumed publication as a weekly in 1925 and became a daily again a month later. Hitler had made Alfred Rosenberg its editor, and the latter continued the anti-Semitic thrust of the paper while making it a forum for Hitler and propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels. The Völkischer Beobachter launched Berlin and South German editions in 1930, and in 1933 the paper opened a new editorial and printing headquarters in Berlin. A Vienna edition began to appear following Germany’s annexation of Austria in 1938. Foreign correspondents and diplomats from the rest of the world followed it for indications of Nazi policy shifts and propaganda objectives, making allowances for its usual exaggeration and hyperbole.
