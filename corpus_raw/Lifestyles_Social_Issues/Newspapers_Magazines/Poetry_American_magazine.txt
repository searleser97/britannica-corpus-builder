Poetry,  U.S. poetry magazine founded in Chicago in 1912 by Harriet Monroe, who became its longtime editor. It became the principal organ for modern poetry of the English-speaking world and survived through World War II. Because its inception coincided with the Chicago literary renaissance, it is often associated with the raw, local-colour poetry of Carl Sandburg, Edgar Lee Masters, Vachel Lindsay, and Sherwood Anderson, but it also championed new formalistic movements, including Imagism. Ezra Pound was its European correspondent; among the authors it published were T.S. Eliot, Wallace Stevens, Marianne Moore, D.H. Lawrence, and William Carlos Williams.
