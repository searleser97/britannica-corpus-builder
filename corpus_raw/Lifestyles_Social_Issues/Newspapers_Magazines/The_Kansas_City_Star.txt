The Kansas City Star,  daily newspaper published in Kansas City, Mo., the leading paper of the region and one of the great newspapers of the United States.
It was established in 1880 by William Rockhill Nelson and a partner, who soon retired. From its earliest days the Star conducted campaigns against such civic abuses as election fraud and dishonesty in government. As the Star’s editor, Nelson dominated every aspect of its activities. His Star in the 1890s successfully campaigned for a municipal auditorium and a park system, in keeping with Nelson’s conviction that part of a newspaper’s challenge is to “build things up.”
After Nelson’s death, in 1915, an employee ownership plan was devised by his son-in-law, Irwin R. Kirkwood, and control of the paper passed to the employees. The Star had become famous for its crusading journalism and its thorough news coverage and editorials. Its alumni include Ernest Hemingway and Edgar Snow.
In 1977 the Star was purchased by New York-based Capital Cities Communications, the first of several corporate owners including the newspaper publisher McClatchy Company, which acquired the paper in 2006. An Internet version of the Star was launched in 1996.
