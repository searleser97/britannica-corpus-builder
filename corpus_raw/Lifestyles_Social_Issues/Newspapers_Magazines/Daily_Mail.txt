Daily Mail,  morning daily newspaper published in London, long noted for its foreign reporting, it was one of the first British papers to popularize its coverage to appeal to a mass readership. It is the flagship publication of the Daily Mail and General Trust PLC, a London media company incorporated in 1922 with holdings in radio, television, and weekly and daily newspapers.
The Daily Mail was founded in 1896 by Alfred Harmsworth, later 1st Viscount Northcliffe (see Northcliffe, Alfred Charles William Harmsworth, Viscount). Its roots can be traced to the Hull Packet (founded in 1787), which was merged with the Hull Evening News in 1884 and 12 years later moved to London and became the Daily Mail. In 1902, its circulation exceeded one million, rivaling the New York World and the New York Journal for the top circulating newspapers. Although the Mail lost circulation in the 1970s, it became one of Britain’s best-selling newspapers at the close of the 20th century.
Historically the paper has been known for its independent editorial stance and coverage of foreign news, such as the Dreyfus affair in France (1894–1906) and the South African War (1899–1902). The paper also syndicates news, features, and pictures to newspapers in other countries.
