The Sydney Morning Herald,  daily newspaper published in Sydney, Australia’s oldest and one of its most influential papers.
The Sydney Herald, founded by three English emigrants—William McGarvie, Alfred Ward Stephens, and Frederick Stokes—was first issued as a weekly in 1831 and became a daily in 1840. The following year another Englishman, John Fairfax, bought control of the paper, which remained in the hands of his family for 149 years. “Morning” was added to its name in 1842.
The paper’s editorial stance is conservative. It has combined serious reporting of national and international news developments with coverage of popular news stories dealing with such subjects as law enforcement and police activities. Not until 1944 did The Sydney Morning Herald discontinue front-page advertising. In the 1950s and ’60s the Herald won international repute for its dedication to responsible journalism, its appeal to diverse audiences, and its coverage of the arts and literature. In the 1980s the Fairfax media empire fell into financial decline and began selling off assets. The Fairfax Group, which included The Sydney Morning Herald, came briefly (1991–96) under the control of Canadian media mogul Conrad Black before Black sold his interest to another firm.
