Maclean’s,  weekly newsmagazine, published in Toronto, whose thorough coverage of Canada’s national affairs and of North American and world news from a Canadian perspective has made it that country’s leading magazine. It was founded in 1905 in a large-page format, presenting feature articles and fiction reflecting a conservative view of Canadian life and values. It developed a reputation for outstanding photography. The magazine features a column of notes about newsworthy Canadians. In the 1970s Maclean’s, like other magazines, encountered rising production and distribution costs while circulation and advertising revenue declined, but it countered by reducing its page size and revising its format.
