Commentary,  monthly American opinion journal examining Jewish affairs worldwide. Although frequently controversial, the magazine significantly influenced the political and intellectual culture of the United States in the post-World War II period.
Commentary was founded by the American Jewish Council in 1945, and it soon became a voice of the Jewish community at large. In its early years, the magazine inspired a generation of Jewish American writers and thinkers, including Saul Bellow, Irving Howe, Lionel Trilling, and Bernard Malamud, a group later labeled the New York Jewish Intellectuals. Many of these young writers and political figures were launched into public life by their contributions to the journal. Editor Elliot Cohen led the magazine from 1945 until his suicide in 1959, when Norman Podhoretz took over. In 1995 he was succeeded by Neal Kozodoy. John Podhoretz, Norman Podhoretz’s son, took over as editor in 2009.
The publication’s character closely matched the political perspective of its respective editors, and what began as a liberal anticommunist journal under Cohen was transformed into a hub of neoconservatism in the 1970s. The main tenets it adopted in subsequent decades included a commitment to the spread of democracy, defense of American and Israeli interests, and opposition to communism, fascism, and Islamic extremism. By the turn of the 21st century, however, critics were accusing the magazine of having abandoned balanced discussion and suppressed dissenting views under Podhoretz’s leadership. In 2007 the publication separated from the American Jewish Council to become an independent nonprofit organization.
