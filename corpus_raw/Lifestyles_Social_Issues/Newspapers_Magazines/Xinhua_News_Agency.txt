Xinhua News Agency, Pinyin Xinhuashe, Wade-Giles romanization Hsin-hua she, also called New China News Agency,  news agency of China, founded in 1931 as the press outlet of the Chinese Communist Party. It was first set up in the Red Army-controlled area in Jiangxi province and in the mid-1930s was moved to Yanâ€™an. The agency is now headquartered in Beijing and has offices around the world. Xinhua has domestic and international services for Chinese and non-Chinese media. Like most of the news media in China, it operates under governmental control, and its releases reflect official policies and promote state programs. These strictures were greatly tightened in the 1960s during the Cultural Revolution, when many Chinese journalists were jailed for deviating from its standards, but were substantially relaxed after the fall from power of the Gang of Four a decade later.
