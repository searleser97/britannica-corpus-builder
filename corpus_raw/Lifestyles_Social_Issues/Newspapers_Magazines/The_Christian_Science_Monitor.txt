The Christian Science Monitor,  American daily online newspaper that is published under the auspices of the Church of Christ, Scientist. Its original print edition was established in 1908 at the urging of Mary Baker Eddy, founder of the church, as a protest against the sensationalism of the popular press. The Monitor became famous for its thoughtful treatment of the news and for the quality of its long-range, comprehensive assessments of political, social, and economic developments. It remains one of the most respected American newspapers. Headquarters are in Boston.
At the time of its founding, the Monitor set out to address a national audience, and its circulation grew to 120,000 in its first decade. Notably under Erwin D. Canham, managing editor and editor from 1940 to 1964, it gained worldwide prestige. In 1965 the Monitor revised its format and began printing photographs on the front page, although the paper remained spare and quite selective in its use of illustrations. In 1975 the paper changed to a tabloid format. Colour photography was introduced in the late 1980s. In 2009, because of a decrease in circulation and mounting financial difficulties, the Monitor ceased publication of its weekday print edition to focus on Internet publishing; it was the first national newspaper to take such action. Weekly print and daily e-mail editions were also afforded to subscribers.
The newspaper does not accept advertising for alcohol or tobacco, nor does it carry ads for questionable financial investments or books and motion pictures it deems salacious. Its secular news coverage is supplemented by one religious article that is published daily, according to the original request made by Mary Baker Eddy when the newspaper was founded.
The newspaper won its sixth Pulitzer Prize in 1996, in the category of international reporting, and received its seventh Pulitzer in 2002 for editorial cartooning. Its Web site, launched in 1996, has won many awards.
