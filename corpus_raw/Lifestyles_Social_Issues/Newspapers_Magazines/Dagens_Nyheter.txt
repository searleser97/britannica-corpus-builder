Dagens Nyheter, (Swedish: “Daily News”)  morning daily newspaper published in Stockholm. It is one of the largest and most influential newspapers in Sweden. It was founded in 1864 by Rudolf Wall. Dagens Nyheter has long been noted for its thorough coverage of the arts, foreign news, and domestic political news. The paper has generally followed a liberal policy politically. For a time in the 1960s, its circulation was greater than that of any other Swedish daily, but it was later overtaken by its sister paper, the afternoon daily tabloid Expressen (Nyheter is of standard size). The two papers have separate editorial staffs. In the late 1990s the circulation of Dagens Nyheter exceeded 300,000.
