Founded in 1917 by Bertie Charles (“B.C.”) Forbes, a business columnist for William Randolph Hearst’s newspaper chain, Forbes magazine was the only major business magazine in the United States throughout the 1920s. By 1930, however, two business magazines had joined the market: Business Week and Fortune. During the 1930s and into the 1940s, Forbes magazine’s circulation numbers fell behind those of its two competitors. Working with his father, Forbes’s son Malcolm S. Forbes initiated several changes in the mid-1940s that increased circulation, including hiring a staff of writers to work exclusively for Forbes and starting the Forbes Investors Advisory Institute, an investment-advice service. Editors hired in the 1950s placed great emphasis upon factual accuracy, a move appreciated by businessmen, who increasingly viewed Forbes as a reliable source of financial information. The magazine enjoyed success throughout the 1970s and in 1982 launched the popular “Forbes Richest 400,” a list of the 400 wealthiest Americans. When Malcolm Forbes died in 1990, his son Steve Forbes became editor in chief. Under his leadership, Forbes launched several spin-off magazines, including Forbes Global Business and Finance (1998), and established international editions in Europe (1998) and Asia (2005).
