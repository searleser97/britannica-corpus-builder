Al-Ahram, (Arabic: “The Pyramids”)  daily newspaper published in Cairo, long regarded as Egypt’s most authoritative and influential newspaper and one of the most important papers in the Arab world.
Al-Ahram was founded in Alexandria in 1875 by two Lebanese Christian brothers, Salīm and Bishārah Taqlā. It became a daily in 1881, although its presses were destroyed in the revolt led by Col. Aḥmad ʿUrābī in the early 1880s. Publishing resumed in September 1882. In the late 1890s, several years after the death of his brother left Bishārah the sole owner, he moved Al-Ahram operations to Cairo. The paper became famous for its independence and objectivity—in spite of British censorship and control—and for its coverage of international news and nonpolitical news about Egypt and Egyptians. However, after censorship tightened as Egyptian independence neared, the paper’s influence waned.
In the late 1950s Al-Ahram came under the influence of the Egyptian government, and, when Pres. Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalized the press in 1960, Al-Ahram became the de facto voice of the government. In 1957 Nasser had made his friend Muhammad Hassanein Heikal the editor of Al-Ahram, and Heikal’s effect on the paper was profound. An eloquent editorialist and a solid journalist, Heikal built the paper’s prestige, its journalistic excellence, and its makeup and technical operation to new levels. Under his leadership, the paper became the dominant daily in the Arab world. Heikal was removed as editor in 1974 when he lost the confidence of Pres. Anwar el-Sādāt, but the qualities he had built into Al-Ahram remained.
Over the years, contributors to Al-Ahram have included some of the most important political and literary elites of the day, including nationalist leaders Muṣṭafā Kāmil and Saʿd Zaghlūl and authors Ṭāhā Ḥusayn and Naguib Mahfouz (some of whose works were first printed as serials in Al-Ahram). English and French editions are also published, and an online edition began in 1998.
