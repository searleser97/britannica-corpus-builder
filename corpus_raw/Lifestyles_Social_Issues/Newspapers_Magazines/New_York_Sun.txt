New York Sun,  daily newspaper published from 1833 to 1950 in New York City, long one of the most influential of American newspapers. The Sun was the first successful penny daily newspaper in the United States. The name was revived for a print and online newspaper in the early 21st century.
The New York Sun was founded by a New York City printer, Benjamin H. Day, as a four-page half-tabloid sheet. Its reports of police-court activities and its witty treatment of news made it a success, and only the Sun and the New York Herald survived from a crowd of 30 or more new penny papers. In 1868 Charles A. Dana purchased the Sun and became its editor, a post he retained until his death 29 years later. He introduced a clear style of journalism, carefully retained the humorous touch that was the paper’s early hallmark, and occasionally used a sensational approach to scandalous news. Under his guidance the Sun became increasingly conservative in its editorial stance, but within eight years the paper’s circulation had tripled, reaching 130,000.
In 1887 the Sun introduced an immediately successful evening edition. The morning Sun and the Evening Sun were sold to Frank A. Munsey in 1916, and the morning edition was merged with Munsey’s New York Press. In 1920 Munsey closed the morning Sun, and the Evening Sun was renamed simply The Sun. Munsey bought the New York Globe and merged it into The Sun in order to give it a membership in the Associated Press. The Sun continued to publish until 1950, when it was sold to the Scripps-Howard group and was merged into the New York World-Telegram.
In 2002 the New York Sun’s name and masthead were used for a newspaper founded and edited by Seth Lipsky. Daily print publication of the newspaper ended in 2008, although it subsequently maintained an online presence.
