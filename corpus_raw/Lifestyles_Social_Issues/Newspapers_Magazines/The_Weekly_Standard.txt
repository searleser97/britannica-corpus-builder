The Weekly Standard,  American political opinion magazine founded in 1995 by William Kristol, Fred Barnes, and John Podhoretz with financial backing from Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation. The Weekly Standard largely reflected the opinions and concerns of contemporary American neoconservatives, often featuring articles on such topics as religious liberty, government regulation, and tax cuts. Although it was not widely read or highly profitable, it was well respected in conservative political circles. It was cited as an influence on the decision of the George W. Bush administration to invade Iraq in 2003 (see Iraq War).
Prior to the September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States in 2001, the Standard had experienced little success at influencing U.S. foreign and domestic policy, and its editors had even considered ceasing publication. Four years earlier Kristol and historian Robert Kagan had published an editorial, “Saddam Must Go,” proposing that the United States invade Iraq and overthrow the country’s leader, Saddam Hussein. The idea received little attention at the time. Following the September 11 attacks, however, the Standard succeeded in creating support for an invasion within the Bush administration and among the American public by repeatedly asserting that Saddam had ties to al-Qaeda, the terrorist organization that had staged the September 11 attacks, and to its leader, Osama bin Laden. The Standard also proposed U.S. military strategies that would prioritize attacking Saddam over eliminating al-Qaeda.
In addition to furthering the neoconservative agenda through the print media, The Weekly Standard published articles and daily updates via its online-only version, The Daily Standard. Frequent contributors included Kagan and the television journalist Brit Hume.
In December 2018 the magazine’s owner, the Clarity Media Group, announced that The Weekly Standard would cease publication in that month.
