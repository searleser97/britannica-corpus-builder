France-Soir, (French: “Evening France”)  daily newspaper published in Paris. Formerly titled Défense de la France (“Defense of France”), it was founded as an underground paper during the German occupation of France in World War II, and after the war it emerged as a journal of mass appeal. Renamed France-Soir, the newspaper ranked among the country’s—and the European continent’s—leaders in circulation, reaching 1.5 million in 1955. Circulation fell thereafter, however, dropping below 90,000 in the early 21st century. Led by a succession of owners over the years, the paper has attempted to attract readers by emphasizing sensational news rather than in-depth analysis or editorial commentary on political developments. Aggressive and imaginative in gathering and reporting news, France-Soir features lively headlines and many photographs. A majority interest in the newspaper was purchased by Egyptian entrepreneur Ramy Lakah in November 2004.
