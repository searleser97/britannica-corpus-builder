Corriere della Sera, (Italian: “Evening Courier”)  morning daily newspaper published in Milan, long one of Italy’s leading newspapers, in terms of both circulation and influence, noted for its foreign coverage and its independence. It was Italy’s preeminent daily for many years following World War II.
Established in 1876 as an evening paper, it later became a morning daily but retained the name. It was acquired in 1885 by a wealthy textile family, the Crespis, who gave it complete editorial independence. Except during the years of fascist rule in Italy, Corriere della Sera followed an independent-centrist editorial policy until the 1970s. In that decade, which was marked at Corriere della Sera by labour disputes, changes in editors, and a change of owners, the paper’s editorial position moved steadily to the left, which prompted a group of editorial employees to move to Corriere della Sera’s centrist rival, Il Giorno.
The paper has appealed to both the upper and the middle classes with its serious and literary style. Using special traveling correspondents and authoritative writers, it has offered finely written, personalized reports and many special departments. The paper also uses such unusual features as an entire page devoted to one subject. Its national coverage is substantial; it has some 600 correspondents throughout Italy and bureaus in 20 foreign cities.
