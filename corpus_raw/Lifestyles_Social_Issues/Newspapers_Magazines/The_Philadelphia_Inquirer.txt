The Philadelphia Inquirer,  daily newspaper published in Philadelphia, long one of the most influential dailies in the eastern United States.
It was founded in 1847 as the Pennsylvania Inquirer but adopted Philadelphia into its name about 1860. When the American Civil War began, it voiced strong support for the North, and it was frequently delivered to Union troops in the field.
The Inquirer was involved in circulation wars through the latter half of the 19th century and the early years of the 20th. It survived by giving its readers broad coverage of the news and by constantly modernizing its plant and equipment. In 1863 the Inquirer became one of the first daily newspapers to use a web-fed rotary press that could print on both sides of the paper at once.
There were several changes of ownership in the early 20th century, but the Inquirer largely retained its character as an aggressive paper. Moses L. Annenberg bought it in 1936 and managed within four years to boost its Sunday circulation to more than one million copies. The paper stayed in his familyâ€™s hands after his death in 1942.
It was acquired in 1969 by John S. Knight, along with the afternoon tabloid Philadelphia Daily News. Both newspapers were included in the merger of the Knight and Ridder groups in 1974; each, however, maintained editorial independence. In 2006 the McClatchy Company acquired Knight Ridder; McClatchy subsequently sold the Inquirer and the Daily News, which passed through a succession of owners.
