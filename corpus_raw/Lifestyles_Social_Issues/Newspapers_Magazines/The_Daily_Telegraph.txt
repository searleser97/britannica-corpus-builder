The Daily Telegraph,  daily newspaper published in London and generally accounted, with The Times and The Guardian, as one of Britain’s “big three” quality newspapers.
Founded in 1855 as the Daily Telegraph and Courier, the paper was acquired later that year by Joseph Moses Levy who, with his son Edward Levy (later Edward Levy-Lawson), renamed it The Daily Telegraph, transformed it into London’s first penny paper, and built a large readership. The newspaper has consistently combined a high standard of reporting with the selection of interesting feature articles and editorial presentation. It takes a conservative, middle-class approach to comprehensive news coverage.
Special reporting has been commonplace throughout the paper’s history. Its correspondents have covered virtually every major war since the American Civil War (1860–65). The paper cosponsored Henry Morton Stanley’s expedition in the 1870s to the Congo and has engaged often in investigative reporting on government and trade unions.
Through the 1970s and ’80s, the Telegraph remained relatively free of labour disputes and maintained financial stability under its family group ownership, headed by Michael Berry, Lord Hartwell. In 1985 Canadian financier Conrad Black (later Baron Black of Crossharbour) bought a majority interest in the Telegraph and shifted ownership to Hollinger Inc., a Canadian holding company controlled by Black. The remaining shares were purchased in 1996. Notwithstanding criticisms that Black’s publications served merely to advance his interests, the Telegraph continued to cover a wide range of subjects, including arts, science, and politics. Questions about Black’s management of the newspaper’s parent company, Hollinger International, combined with financial scandals, forced another change of ownership. In July 2004 the paper was acquired by twin brothers Sir David and Sir Frederick Barclay, who also owned the Scotsman.
