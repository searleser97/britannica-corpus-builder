Popular Mechanics,  American print and online magazine that publishes articles on home improvement, automobile maintenance, and new advancements in technology and science. Founded in 1902 by Henry H. Windsor, Popular Mechanics is one of the oldest magazines in the United States. It has been published since 1958 by Hearst Magazines, a division of the Hearst Corporation, Inc.
The magazine’s mission has remained much the same since its debut. Windsor envisioned Popular Mechanics as a weekly review of current innovations; its original motto, “Written so you can understand it,” defines Windsor’s audience as laypersons who are curious about emerging technologies. Early editions of Popular Mechanics, easily recognizable by their bright cover paintings and narrow trim size, detailed new inventions and offered instruction on home building projects and decor. Throughout the 20th century, Popular Mechanics chronicled technological developments such as the automobile and the airplane, television and space travel, and nuclear power. How-to articles on home construction, auto repair, and personal electronics remain a key element of the publication, while other monthly features include a new technology summary and product reviews and comparisons, including reviews of new automobiles.
In the early 21st century the magazine took on a more political bent, focusing on technological challenges in the areas of national security, environmental protection, and energy. Following the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001, the magazine launched an investigation into conspiracy theories surrounding the event; it ultimately published a book that debunked the theories.
The magazine’s annual Breakthrough Awards honour technological advancements that have the potential to better the world. Popular Mechanics has itself won numerous awards, most frequently for design and illustration.
