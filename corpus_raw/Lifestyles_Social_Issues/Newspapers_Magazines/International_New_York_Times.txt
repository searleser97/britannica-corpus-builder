International New York Times, formerly International Herald Tribune (IHT),  daily newspaper published in Paris, France, that has long been the staple source of English-language news for American expatriates, tourists, and businesspeople in Europe. It is considered the first “global” newspaper.
The International New York Times’s roots are in the Paris Herald, which was established in 1887 by James Gordon Bennett, Jr., who had inherited the New York Herald from his father, James Gordon Bennett. After Bennett, Jr., died in 1918, Frank Andrew Munsey bought the Paris edition along with its New York City parent. His attempts to buy the New York Tribune to combine with the Herald were thwarted, so he sold the Herald to the Tribune, and the merger came about in reverse.
The Paris Herald Tribune enjoyed great popularity—as the Paris edition of the New York Herald-Tribune—and was affectionately called “Le New York” by many Parisians. The paper shared its own reportage with the New York Herald-Tribune and had full access to the parent paper’s stories. It was shut down for four years when the Germans occupied Paris in World War II, but it regained its old momentum and was faring well in the 1960s when rising costs, falling revenues, and a lengthy strike swept the New York Herald-Tribune into a series of mergers and eventual extinction. Rescued by a joint venture of The New York Times, The Washington Post, and Whitney Communications, the Paris edition was renamed the International Herald Tribune (IHT). The Post and Times companies were the sole co-owners until the New York Times Company purchased full ownership of the IHT in 2003. In 2013 the paper’s name was changed to the International New York Times.
The headquarters are in Paris, but the paper is printed in cities around the world. It also has an online edition.
