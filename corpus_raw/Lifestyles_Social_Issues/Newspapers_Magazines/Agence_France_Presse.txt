Agence France-Presse (AFP),  French cooperative news agency, one of the world’s great wire news services. It is based in Paris, where it was founded under its current name in 1944, but its roots go to the Bureau Havas, which was created in 1832 by Charles-Louis Havas, who translated reports from foreign papers and distributed them to Paris and provincial newspapers. In 1835 the Bureau Havas became the Agence Havas, the world’s first true news agency. Stressing rapid transmission of the news, Agence Havas established the first telegraph service in France in 1845. Between 1852 and 1919 the agency worked in close collaboration with an advertising firm, the Correspondance General Havas. Staff correspondents for the agency were stationed in many world capitals by the late 1800s.
The German occupation of France suppressed Agence Havas in 1940, and many of its personnel were active in the underground. After the liberation of Paris in 1944, underground journalists emerged to set up AFP as a wire-service voice for liberated France. The postwar French government gave AFP the assets of Agence Havas, including the Paris building that became its headquarters. AFP quickly joined Reuters (United Kingdom), TASS (U.S.S.R.; later, ITAR-TASS of Russia), and the U.S. agencies Associated Press (AP) and United Press International (UPI) as one of the world’s leading news agencies. In addition to having bureaus in major French cities, it has bureaus and correspondents in important world capitals. Besides having contracts with AP, Reuters, and ITAR-TASS for exchange of news reports, it sells a domestic French news report to most of the world’s news agencies and provides its worldwide report to many of them. AFP also has a photo service and a number of specialized news reports, several concerned with African matters.
