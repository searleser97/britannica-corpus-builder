Aftenposten, (Norwegian: “The Evening Post”)  daily newspaper published in Oslo. It is one of the leading newspapers in Norway and in all of Scandinavia.
It was established in 1860 by Christian Schibsted and played a significant role in developing a sense of Norwegian nationhood. Noted from its founding for the strength of its coverage of local and, increasingly, national news, Aftenposten generally took an editorial stance that was moderately conservative.
During the 1930s the newspaper generally supported Nazi Germany in its editorials. After Germany invaded and occupied Norway in 1940, Aftenposten’s editor was replaced by its elevator operator, who had been a member of the “fifth column” of traitorous Maj. Vidkun Quisling. For the remainder of World War II, the paper was a willing Nazi propaganda organ. During the occupation, more than 60 editors of Norwegian newspapers were executed and 3,000 sent to concentration camps.
In the postwar era, Aftenposten won wide note for the quality of its coverage of international news while retaining its outstanding strength in local and national affairs.
