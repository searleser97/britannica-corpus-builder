Het Laatste Nieuws, (Flemish:  “The Latest News”)  daily newspaper published in Brussels. It is the largest daily in Belgium and was founded in 1888 to serve Flemish-speaking citizens.
Although it takes a serious approach to national and international news, it also features comic strips, crossword puzzles, and cartoons. In the 1960s a large and attractive sports section of several pages was added. A morning paper with a seven-column page and a dignified makeup style (column and cutoff rules—rather than columns—separate stories), it reached a circulation of more than 307,000 by the end of the 20th century.
