Izvestiya, (Russian: “News”) also spelled Izvestia, formerly in full Izvestiya Sovetov Deputatov Trudyashchikhsya S.S.S.R. (Russian: “News of the Councils of Working People’s Deputies of the U.S.S.R.”),  historically important Russian daily newspaper published in Moscow. The paper was published by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. and was the official national publication of the Soviet government until 1991.
The newspaper was founded in March 1917 in Petrograd (now St. Petersburg) as an organ of the Petrograd Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies. After the October Revolution that year, control of Izvestiya passed from the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries into the hands of the Bolsheviks, and the paper’s main offices were moved to Moscow. Izvestiya grew rapidly to a circulation of 354,000 in 1924 and 1,500,000 by 1932. Restrictions during World War II and under Joseph Stalin slowed its growth, but under the editorship of Nikita Khrushchev’s son-in-law, Alexei Adzhubei, Izvestiya was transformed into a lively, readable daily with the introduction of more photographs, bigger headlines, shorter and more interesting articles, and a generally high standard of design.
Izvestiya remained an instrument of the state for informing and educating the people in the light of Soviet government policies, and its extensive coverage of international relations made it the principal voice for Soviet foreign policy. Following the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, Izvestiya became an independent publication owned by its employees. Its liberal editorial policy often placed it at odds with both unreconstructed communists and Russian nationalists.
