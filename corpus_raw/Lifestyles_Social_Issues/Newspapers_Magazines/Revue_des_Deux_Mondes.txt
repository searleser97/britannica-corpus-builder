Revue des Deux Mondes,  fortnightly journal of criticism of and commentary on literature and other arts, published in Paris in 1829 and from 1831 to 1944. It was one of a number of journals set up in France following the suspension of censorship in 1828, and it attained a critical influence in that country comparable to the great Scottish and English journals of the day. Revue des Deux Mondes, however, did not concern itself with politics, and its influence was confined to the arts.
François Buloz was its editor from 1831 to 1877 and established a tradition of excellence that attracted contributions from such literary eminences as Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve, Honoré de Balzac, Victor Hugo, Hippolyte Taine, and Ernest Renan. One of its contributors was Ferdinand Brunetière, who became its editor from 1893 to 1906. The journal suspended publication in 1944 but was brought out again from 1948 under the title La Revue de Littérature, Histoire, Arts et Sciences des Deux Mondes.
