The Scotsman,  morning daily newspaper published in Edinburgh, widely influential in Scotland and long considered a leading exemplar of responsible journalism.
It was founded in 1817 as a weekly and began daily publication in 1855, when the newspaper stamp duty was abolished. The Scotsman was highly innovative in production and distribution; it was the first paper in Europe to own and operate wirephoto equipment and the first newspaper outside London to open an office on Fleet Street in that city. A computer system for editorial and advertising copy became operational in 1987, and a new full-colour press opened in 1990. Founded as a politically independent newspaper, The Scotsman continues to be known for its balanced views and for its insistence on sound reporting on literature and the arts as well as on domestic and foreign news.
