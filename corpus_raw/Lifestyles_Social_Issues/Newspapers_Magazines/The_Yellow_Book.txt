The Yellow Book,  short-lived but influential illustrated quarterly magazine devoted to aesthetics, literature, and art. It was published in London from 1894 to 1897.
From its initial visually arresting issue, for which Aubrey Beardsley was art editor and for which Max Beerbohm wrote an essay, “A Defence of Cosmetics,” The Yellow Book attained immediate notoriety. Published by John Lane and edited by Henry Harland, The Yellow Book attracted many outstanding writers and artists of the era, such as Arnold Bennett, Charlotte Mew, Henry James, Edmund Gosse, Richard Le Gallienne, and Walter Sickert.
