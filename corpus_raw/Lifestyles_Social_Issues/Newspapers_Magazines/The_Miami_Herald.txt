The Miami Herald,  daily newspaper published in Miami, generally considered the dominant paper in southern Florida and recognized for its coverage of Latin America.
The Herald was established in 1910 and was known in its early years as a “reporter’s paper” because of the freedom of expression it gave many of its writers. The paper also gained a reputation for its hard-hitting exposés and its thorough coverage of Miami’s large Spanish-speaking community. Its sister publication, the Spanish-language El Nuevo Herald, is sold in southern and central Florida. An international edition of The Miami Herald was begun in 1946 and sold in more than two dozen Caribbean and Latin American countries (it discontinued distribution to both regions in 2009).
John S. Knight acquired the Herald in 1937 in the process of building what would become one of the largest American newspaper chains, Knight Ridder. The Herald extended its international edition to Mexico in 2002. In 2006 ownership of the paper passed to the McClatchy Company after its acquisition of Knight Ridder. However, because of increasing financial difficulties in a struggling newspaper industry, the Herald subsequently underwent a period of major restructuring that included employee buyouts and job cuts.
The Herald has long crusaded against organized crime and community problems, and it is widely noted for its outstanding local reporting. It has won 20 Pulitzer Prizes.
