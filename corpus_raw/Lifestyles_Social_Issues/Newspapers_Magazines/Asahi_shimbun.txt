Asahi shimbun, (Japanese: “Morning Sun Newspaper”)  nationwide Japanese daily newspaper, one of the “big three” in influence and circulation, printed in Tokyo, Ōsaka, and several other regional centres and also as an English-language-edition daily in Tokyo.
Asahi was founded in Ōsaka in 1879 and has been in the hands of the Murayama and Ueno families since 1881. It is particularly noted for its political coverage and its foreign news. The paper is known for its liberal and progressive views. It has correspondents in major cities in Europe, Asia, and the United States and subscribes to more than 20 international news services. Like the other two major Japanese newspapers, Yomiuri and Mainichi, Asahi publishes a much greater proportion of foreign news than is usual in the West. In the early 21st century its daily circulation was one of the largest in the world, with more than six million subscribers. The readership of Asahi is drawn mainly from the upper and middle classes.
