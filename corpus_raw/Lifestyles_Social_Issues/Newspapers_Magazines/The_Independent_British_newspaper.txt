The Independent,  politically independent daily newspaper founded in 1986 and published in London.
The founders of The Independent—Andreas Whittam Smith, Matthew Symonds, and Stephen Glover (all former staff members of The Daily Telegraph)—believed that many of Britain’s educated and affluent citizens desired an objective source of daily news, one without the strong political biases of the country’s established newspapers. The Independent found a large audience immediately, its daily sales nearly matching those of The Guardian and The Times. A Sunday edition, The Independent on Sunday, was launched in 1990.
The newspaper has changed hands several times in its history. The original owner, the financial conglomerate Newspaper Publishing, sold controlling shares in The Independent to Independent News and Media PLC (INM) and to Mirror Group Newspapers in 1995; the former bought full control in 1998. During a rocky transition period marked by conflicts over the paper’s direction and by frequent staff changes, readership declined precipitously. Circulation increased in 2004 after the paper replaced its broadsheet edition with a tabloid edition. In 2010 Russian businessman Alexander Lebedev acquired The Independent.
Renowned for its journalistic integrity, The Independent received critical praise for its innovative use of graphic design, prominent placement of artistic photographs, disclosure of article sources, and faithful crediting of other newspapers and news agencies for borrowed coverage. The paper began publishing in colour in 2008. However, The Independent experienced a steady decline in circulation, and on March 26, 2016, the paper published its last print edition as it moved to a digital-only format.
