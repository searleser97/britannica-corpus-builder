The Paris Review,  American literary quarterly founded in 1953 by Peter Matthiessen, Harold L. Humes, and George Plimpton, with Plimpton also serving as the first editor. It is an English-language review modeled on the independent literary magazines (also known as “little magazines”) published in Paris in the 1920s. Although established in Paris, it moved to New York City in the 1970s.
Under the editorship (1953–2003) of Plimpton, The Paris Review became known for presenting quality fiction and poetry by both established authors and new or relatively unknown writers; it helped launch the careers of Philip Roth, Jack Kerouac, Raymond Carver, and Adrienne Rich, among others. It was one of the first American journals to publish Samuel Beckett. The review also became famous for its interviews of notable writers, including E.M. Forster, Ernest Hemingway, Aldous Huxley, Nadine Gordimer, T.S. Eliot, William Faulkner, Vladimir Nabokov, Joan Didion, Seamus Heaney, and Ian McEwan, among others. Beginning in 1958, those interviews were published in a series known as Writers at Work.
The Paris Review presents several prestigious annual literary prizes, including the Hadada Award, given for contributions to literature and whose recipients have included John Ashbery, Didion, Norman Mailer, James Salter, and William Styron; the Plimpton Prize for Fiction, given in honour of its founding editor to prominent “new voices” published in the journal each year; and the Terry Southern Prize for Humor, created in memory of its longtime contributor and awarded to writers demonstrating wit and humour, especially in online writing.
