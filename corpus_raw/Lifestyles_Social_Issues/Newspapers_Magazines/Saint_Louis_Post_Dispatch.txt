Saint Louis Post-Dispatch,  morning daily newspaper published in St. Louis, Mo., one of the most prestigious newspapers in the United States and a dominant voice of the Lower Midwest.
It was founded in 1878 when Joseph Pulitzer purchased the 15-year-old, bankrupt St. Louis Dispatch and merged it with the 3-year-old St. Louis Post of John A. Dillon to form the St. Louis Post and Dispatch, shortly simplified to St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Pulitzer established an independent, liberal policy from the beginning and took a strong stance against corruption in public office. The paper conducted a succession of civic crusades and sensational exposés that attracted a growing readership. By 1881 the Post-Dispatch had a circulation of 22,000 and was the largest evening paper in the city.
Joseph Pulitzer II joined the paper in 1906 and took control on his father’s death in 1911. He in turn was succeeded by Joseph Pulitzer III in 1955. Under the second Pulitzer particularly, the P-D, as it is widely known, greatly improved its international coverage, though not by the usual practice of setting up permanent bureaus in foreign capitals. Instead, the Post-Dispatch sent reporters or teams from St. Louis to wherever world news was being made. In domestic coverage it stressed accurate reporting and clear analysis. In its editorials the paper has consistently espoused minority-group causes and waged campaigns to eliminate social ills. It has clung to the independence declared at its founding, variously supporting Democrats or Republicans, usually of a liberal persuasion.
