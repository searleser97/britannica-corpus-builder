North American Review,  American magazine, founded in 1815, that was one of the country’s leading literary journals of the 19th and 20th centuries. It was founded in Boston, Mass., under the auspices of the Monthly Anthology (1803–11) and began publication as a regional magazine, reflecting the intellectual ideas and tastes of Boston and New England. The poet William Cullen Bryant’s first contribution to the review, “Thanatopsis” (1817), made him famous. Other early contributors included Daniel Webster, John Adams, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and Francis Parkman.
The North American Review had become somewhat dull by midcentury but regained its prestige under the editorships of James Russell Lowell (1863–72) and Henry Adams (1872–76). In 1877 it was purchased by Allen Thorndike Rice, who served as editor until his death in 1889. Rice moved the review to New York City and transformed it into a national periodical dealing with contemporary issues, affairs, and movements. It became noted for its critical influence and outstanding writing concerning social and political issues. William Dean Howells, Walt Whitman, and Henry James contributed to the magazine, which attained a peak circulation of 76,000 in 1891. By the turn of the century the review’s diverse contributors included William Gladstone, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Mark Twain, and H.G. Wells. The magazine’s circulation fell after World War I, however, and in 1935 it was sold to Joseph Hilton Smyth, under whose editorship it ceased publication in 1940. It resumed publication in 1964, under the direction of the poet Robert Dana at Cornell College in Mount Vernon, Iowa, and in 1968 it was purchased by the University of Northern Iowa.
