Jewish Daily Forward, Yiddish Forverts,  newspaper published in New York City in both Yiddish and English versions.
The Forward was founded in 1897 by the Jewish Socialist Press Federation as a civic aid and a cohesive device for Jewish immigrants from Europe. It quickly became the leading Yiddish-language newspaper in the United States. Under the guidance of Abraham Cahan, who was its editor from 1903 to 1951, the paper combined conventional news coverage with a commitment to democratic socialism and Jewish trade unionism. The Forward carried columns on government, politics, and education while also providing English lessons and personal advice to its readers. It also carried short stories and novels in serial form, most notably those of Isaac Bashevis Singer. At the height of its influence during World War I, the Forward had a daily circulation of more than 200,000 in 11 local and regional editions, but by the late 20th century its readership had greatly declined, and the paper was published only as a weekly. An English version began appearing in 1990, and a Russian version was published in 1995â€“2005.
