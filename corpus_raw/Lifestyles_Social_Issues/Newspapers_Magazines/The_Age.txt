The Age,  Australian daily newspaper published in Melbourne and widely considered to provide some of the finest news coverage in the country. It has been highly regarded for its dedication to accuracy.
Originally established as an eight-page weekly in 1854 by the brothers John and Henry Cooke, it became a daily after being sold to Ebenezer and David Syme in 1856. Under David Syme’s leadership the paper grew with the state of Victoria and became noted for its serious tone and liberal orientation.
The Age has consistently given particular attention to politics and economics. It has rarely hesitated to attack political leaders, among them Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies (1894–1978), who nonetheless termed The Age his favourite paper.
