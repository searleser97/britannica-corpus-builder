Le Journal des Débats,  (French: “The Journal of Debates”), former Parisian daily newspaper that was one of the most influential organs of the French press in the 19th century. Founded in 1789 by Gaultier de Biauzat to report the debates of the National Assembly, the Journal des Débats was acquired in 1799 by the Bertin family, which retained control of it until 1871.
Moderately liberal in its viewpoint, Débats was critical of the Restoration monarchy and the Second Empire but favourable to Louis-Philippe. Its contributors included such literary figures as François-René de Chateaubriand, Ernest Renan, and Hippolyte Taine. Débats continued to be published until August 1944.
