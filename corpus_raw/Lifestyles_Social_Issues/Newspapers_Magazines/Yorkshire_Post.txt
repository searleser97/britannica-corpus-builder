Yorkshire Post,  daily newspaper that is the chief Conservative paper published in England outside London. It is one of the most prestigious provincial papers in Britain.
The Post is descended from the Leeds Intelligencer, a four-page weekly founded in Leeds, Yorkshire, England, by Griffith Knight in 1754. When it was purchased by a group of Conservatives in 1866, the Intelligencer changed its name to the Yorkshire Post and went to daily publication. It soon won a reputation as a serious newspaper interested in developments beyond the borders of Yorkshire.
Starting in 1882, when Charles Pebody assumed the duties of editor, the Yorkshire Post began to attract a continually broadening readership by stressing important local, national, and international news and by thoughtful, perceptive editorials reflecting an independent policy. In the 1930s the Post opposed any appeasement of Nazi Germany. By the 1960s it was ranked among Britainâ€™s most influential dailies and was considered in the same class with such papers as The Guardian of Manchester and The Scotsman of Edinburgh.
