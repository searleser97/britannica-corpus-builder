Dissent,  quarterly American journal of leftist international politics, economics, and culture. Founded in New York City in 1954, Dissent features criticism of conventional opinion on both the right and the left from an independent, social-democratic perspective.
Dissent was founded by a small group of socialist and radical intellectuals to champion the values of the democratic left and reinvigorate American intellectual opposition to McCarthyism at home and Stalinism and other forms of totalitarianism abroad. The founding editorial board included Lewis Coser, Emanuel Geltman, Irving Howe, Norman Mailer, Harold Orlans, Simone Plastrik, Stanley Plastrik, Bernard Rosenberg, and Meyer Schapiro. Howe, a literary critic, edited Dissent until his death in 1993. Later editors were the political theorists Mitchell Cohen and Michael Walzer.
Dissent is known for publishing well-reasoned polemical essays and lively intellectual debates. Its contributors have included many eminent political theorists, philosophers, and writers, such as Hannah Arendt, Erich Fromm, GÃ¼nter Grass, C. Wright Mills, Richard Rorty, Alexander Solzhenitsyn, and Richard Wright. A typical issue includes coverage of U.S. and European politics, discussion of social and cultural topics, and commentaries. Although decidedly left-wing, Dissent critiques both liberal and conservative views and occasionally reserves its strongest criticism for the left. The journal has a small circulation but supplements its budget with donations.
