O Estado de S. Paulo, (Portuguese: “The State of São Paulo”)  influential newspaper published daily in São Paulo, Brazil’s largest city. O Estado is widely respected for its thorough coverage of national and international news, its publication of the texts of speeches of important government officials, and other matter usually found in a country’s newspaper of record. O Estado is sometimes called the “New York Times of Latin America” because of its grave editorial demeanour.
Since shortly after its founding in 1875, O Estado has been owned by the Mesquita family. On occasion its independence has brought on government censorship and harassment of reporters, and its editor went into exile during the Getúlio Vargas regime, which ended in 1945. Once boycotted by the German-speaking community in Brazil because of its support of the Allies, O Estado is generally friendly to the United States and encourages the cultivation of European arts and culture. Its editorial outlook is normally pro-industry, and, because of its immense prestige, O Estado de S. Paulo exerts a profound influence on national and local politics.
