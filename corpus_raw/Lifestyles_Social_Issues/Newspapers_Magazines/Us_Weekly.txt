Us Weekly, formerly Us and Us, the Entertainment Magazine,  American celebrity-news magazine published in New York City.
Founded as Us by the New York Times Co. in 1977, the magazine was sold to MacFadden Holdings, Inc., and Warner Communications Inc. in 1980. American publishing mogul Jann Wenner (owner of Wenner Media, which also published Rolling Stone and Men’s Journal) and Telepictures Corp. purchased Us from MacFadden in 1985. In 1989 Wenner assumed total ownership of the magazine and changed its name to Us, the Entertainment Magazine. Wenner and his staff were credited with transforming the magazine into a premier source of celebrity and entertainment news. Us, the Entertainment Magazine went from a monthly to a weekly publication in 2000 and was renamed Us Weekly in 2002. The Walt Disney Co. became an investor in the magazine in 2001. In 2006 Wenner Media bought out Disney’s share and once again held total ownership of Us Weekly.
Competing with Time Warner’s People magazine, Us Weekly focuses on the lives of celebrities, reporting on the relationships, pregnancies, and mundane daily activities of Hollywood’s elite in a format consisting of short articles accompanied by many photographs. Fashion, beauty, and entertainment topics are covered as well. Marketed primarily to female readers, Us Weekly had an estimated weekly circulation of more than one million copies in 2008.
