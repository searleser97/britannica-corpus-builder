The Chronicle of Higher Education,  independent weekly newspaper devoted to national issues affecting higher education. First published in 1966, the Washington, D.C.-based newspaper quickly became an authoritative source of in-depth news coverage for college administrators, faculty, students, and alumni.
While serving as editor of the alumni magazine at Johns Hopkins University in the 1950s, Corbin Gwaltney developed a print supplement that discussed timely issues in American higher education. Initial interest in the publication was high, and several universities purchased the supplement for inclusion in their own alumni magazines. Gwaltney eventually left the Hopkins magazine to launch an independent publication that would provide exclusive coverage of new developments in higher education, social and political issues, and future initiatives of universities across the country. The first issue of The Chronicle was published in 1966. In accordance with Gwaltney’s vision of a trustworthy, impartial news source with wide appeal, The Chronicle has never featured editorials.
The fledgling newspaper initially was supported by grants from the Carnegie Corporation and the Ford Foundation, but the introduction of classified advertisements in 1970 allowed it to become financially independent. The classifieds have since expanded into an entire section, an extensive resource for those seeking employment in higher education. In the decades since its inception, The Chronicle has distinguished itself from its competitors—such as University Business and the now-defunct Lingua Franca—and has expanded readership of its print and Web versions to more than 300,000. The Chronicle staff have received numerous awards, both for specific news coverage and for general excellence.
