Congressional Quarterly (CQ), in full Congressional Quarterly Service,  group of periodicals published in Washington, D.C., reporting the activities and politics of the U.S. Congress. It was established in 1945 by Henrietta and Nelson Poynter, editor and publisher of the St. Petersburg, Fla., Times. Over the next decade the original Quarterly evolved into a Weekly Report with a Quarterly Index, an annual Almanac, and a news service. CQ quickly became indispensable to the expanding press corps covering the growing Congressional establishment in the U.S. capital.
The CQ Weekly Report is mailed to subscribers every Saturday, covering the preceding week’s actions, debates, and committee proceedings in carefully edited, concise form. The CQ Almanac is a compendium of legislation from each annual session of Congress and is published every spring. In addition, various special volumes and series are published from time to time, reviewing significant government activities and special problems, e.g., the Watergate scandal. The firm also performs contract research and maintains a query service for subscribers, usually newspapers. CQ also publishes Editorial Research Reports, which provide background information on current issues. In addition to news media, CQ’s users include libraries, lobbyists, and many government—including Congressional—offices.
