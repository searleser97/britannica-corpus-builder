The Jerusalem Post,  Israeli English-language daily newspaper established in 1932 as the Palestine Post. It adopted its current name in 1950 and is the largest English-language daily in the country. A morning paper appearing daily except Saturday, The Post has traditionally stressed foreign news, giving particular attention to Arab-Israeli relations. In the early 21st century, its daily circulation amounted to roughly 11,000 in Israel and 26,000 in the United States. A weekly French-language edition reached 3,000 readers in France. The newspaperâ€™s popular weekend edition is the basis for an international edition called The Jerusalem Post Weekly.
Independent in its editorial policies yet widely seen in Israel as politically right-of-centre, The Jerusalem Post has combined spare writing with economical headlines and careful editing to build a reputation for informative and thorough coverage. The paper was sold in 2004 when two firms each purchased a 50 percent share in The Jerusalem Post from beleaguered Hollinger International, which had recently sold the Telegraph of London. The new owners were CanWest Global Communications, a Canadian newspaper publisher, and Mirkaei Tikshoret, a diversified Israeli media firm controlled by investor Eli Azur.
