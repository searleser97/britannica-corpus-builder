Life,  weekly picture magazine (1936–72) published in New York City. Life was a pioneer in photojournalism and one of the major forces in that field’s development. It was long one of the most popular and widely imitated of American magazines. It was founded by Henry Luce, publisher of Time, and quickly became a cornerstone of his Time-Life Publications.
From its start, Life emphasized photography, with gripping, superbly chosen news photographs, amplified by photo features and photo-essays on an international range of topics. Its photographers were the elite of their craft and enjoyed worldwide esteem. Life’s war coverage of World War II, Korea, Vietnam, and numerous regional wars was consistently vivid, authentic, and moving. Gradually, the magazine began to admit more writing to its pages, carefully choosing its writers and text editors. Life ceased publication largely because the costs of preparing, printing, and mailing each issue outstripped its revenues from advertising. It reappeared in several special issues after 1972 and then, in 1978, on a reduced scale and on a regular basis as a monthly. In March 2000, Life’s parent company, Time Inc., announced that it was abandoning its monthly publication and would use Life’s name for special features and books.
