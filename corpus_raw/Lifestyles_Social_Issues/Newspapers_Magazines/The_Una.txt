The Una,  American publication, founded by Paulina W. Davis in 1853, that was widely recognized as the first periodical of the women’s rights movement. Though several similar journals had appeared the previous year, The Una was the first to be owned, edited, and published by a woman. The inaugural issue was released in February 1853 with a masthead reading “A Paper Devoted to the Elevation of Women.” Elizabeth Cady Stanton was a contributor to the paper, as were Lucy Stone and Caroline Dall as correspondents. Chronicling the movement’s progress and advancing its principles, the newspaper was published in Providence, Rhode Island, for two years and moved to Boston in 1855. Financial problems, however, plagued the paper, and its last issue appeared on October 15 of that year.
