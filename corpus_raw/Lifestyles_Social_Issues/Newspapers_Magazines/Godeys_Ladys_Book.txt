Godey’s Lady’s Book,  American publication that, from 1830 to 1898, pioneered a format still employed by magazines devoted to women’s issues.
Louis A. Godey, a publisher and former newspaper editor, established his magazine in 1830 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. During the first six years of its existence, it included mainly articles clipped from British women’s magazines and hand-coloured plates reproducing fashions of the day. Godey, wanting to provide more original content by American authors, bought the Boston Ladies’ Magazine in January 1837 and invited its editor, Sarah Josepha Hale, to edit the revamped publication, called Godey’s Lady’s Book. Ladies’ Magazine, which was published by Hale from 1828 to 1837, often included much of Hale’s own work and was built on an editorial policy committed to providing original writing and reliable materials for the education of a female readership.
Working effectively as collaborators for the next 40 years, Hale and Godey commissioned fiction, poetry, and essays almost exclusively from American writers, many of them women. Among the distinguished authors on the magazine’s literary pages were Nathaniel Hawthorne, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Edgar Allan Poe, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and Harriet Beecher Stowe. Hale and Godey steered away from politics, religion, and social issues, focusing instead on women’s domestic education from health to home to fashion—the magazine was especially noted for its coloured fashion plates—and maintained a popular following and a readership that numbered 150,000 at its high point in 1860.
Considered an innovative publication both because it was edited by a woman and because it employed a predominantly female workforce, Godey’s Lady’s Book fell into decline only after Hale retired, and Godey sold the journal in 1877. It was eventually absorbed by Puritan magazine.
