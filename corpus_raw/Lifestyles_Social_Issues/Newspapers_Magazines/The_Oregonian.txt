The Oregonian,  morning daily newspaper published in Portland, Oregon, one of the leading dailies of the U.S. Northwest and for many years during the 19th century the only newspaper in the seven northwesternmost states.
It was founded as a weekly in 1850, when Portland had only 700 inhabitants. The paperâ€™s first publisher, Thomas J. Dryer, was appointed by President Abraham Lincoln to be U.S. commissioner of the Sandwich Islands (later the Hawaiian Islands), and Dryer gave the paper to his typographer and printer, Henry Pittock, in lieu of back wages. The paper became a daily in 1861.
Politically independent, The Oregonian gained regional and national recognition for its editorial excellence. The paper was quick to adopt new technology, and it was one of the first publications in the United States to transmit copy by telegraph and to use pictures received by wirephoto. In 1950 Samuel I. Newhouse purchased the paper, and the Newhouse family retained ownership through its company, Advance Publications Inc.
