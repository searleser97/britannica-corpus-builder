The Statesman,  English-language daily newspaper published in Kolkata and, with the Times of India and The Hindu, generally regarded as one of the most influential in India.
It was established in 1875 by Robert Knight as an outgrowth of an earlier paper, The Friend of India (founded 1817). On Knight’s death in 1890, his sons, Paul and Robert, assumed control. The Statesman soon became one of India’s leading dailies in a country where such papers wield significantly greater influence than do the smaller papers published in the various Indian languages.
The Statesman has a liberal-independent editorial stance, and it is respected for the fairness of its coverage of differing points of view. Its audience includes opinion leaders and intellectuals from throughout Indian society. Like other major Indian dailies, it allots a relatively high proportion of its space—about one-fourth—to foreign news.
