The Bulletin,  daily newspaper published in Philadelphia from 1847 to 1982, long considered one of the most influential American newspapers.
Founded by Alexander Cummings as Cummings Telegraphic Evening Bulletin, the newspaper became The Daily Evening Bulletin in 1856 and then the Evening Bulletin in 1870. The paper was one of the first in the United States to transmit news by telegraph and was the first evening paper to succeed in the city of Philadelphia.
In 1895, after several changes of ownership, William L. McLean bought the Evening Bulletin and built it into Philadelphiaâ€™s largest newspaper. Sold by the McLean family in 1980, The Bulletin closed in January 1982 after a lengthy strike.
Between 2004 and 2009 a daily print edition of a newspaper using the names The Evening Bulletin and The Bulletin was available in Philadelphia; naming rights had been purchased from the McLean family. It subsequently maintained an irregular print and online presence.
