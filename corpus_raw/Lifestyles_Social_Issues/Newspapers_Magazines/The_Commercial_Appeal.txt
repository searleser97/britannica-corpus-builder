The Commercial Appeal,  morning daily newspaper published in Memphis, Tenn., and one of the leading daily papers of the Mid-South in the United States.
Founded in 1840 by Henry van Pelt as a two-page sheet called The Western World and the Memphis Banner of the Constitution, it was shortly renamed The Memphis Daily Appeal. During the American Civil War its sympathies, like those of most of western Tennessee, were with the Confederacy. The paper loaded its presses onto railway cars and shuttled about the region, continuing to publish for three years while evading the Union armies. In 1890 the Daily Appeal purchased a rival newspaper and became The Appeal-Avalanche, which four years later was merged with The Commercial, changing its name again to The Commercial Appeal. Noted for its independent stance, The Commercial Appeal has crusaded for many local causes. It was acquired by the Scrippsâ€“Howard group in 1936.
