Illustrated London News,  historic magazine of news and the arts, published in London, a forerunner in the use of various graphic arts. It was founded as a weekly in 1842 by Herbert Ingram, and it became a monthly in 1971. It was Londonâ€™s first illustrated periodical, with 32 woodcuts in the 16 pages of its first issue. It was also the first periodical to make extensive use of woodcuts and engravings and the first to use photographs. The Illustrated London News was an instant success, and when, shortly after it appeared, it won the approval of the archbishop of Canterbury, it also won the support of the churchgoing public. At first its illustrations focused mainly on English social life. Later, it broadened its scope to embrace general news and the arts and began to send its artists all over the world to record events as they occurred. In 1912 it became the first periodical using rotogravure to publish an integrated picture and text section. When the Illustrated London News became a monthly, it had gained note for its worldwide photographic coverage of cultural activities. In the early 21st century it was published twice yearly.
