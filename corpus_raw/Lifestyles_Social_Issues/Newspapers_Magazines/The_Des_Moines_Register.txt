The Des Moines Register,  morning daily newspaper published in Des Moines, Iowa, one of the most influential regional newspapers in the United States.
It was founded in 1860 and absorbed its older competitor, the Des Moines Leader (founded as the Iowa Star in 1849), in a merger in 1902, becoming the Register and Leader. In the following year Gardner Cowles, Sr., bought the paper, and in 1908 he purchased an evening daily, the Des Moines Tribune (1906). Publication of both papers—the morning Register and the evening Tribune, each with a separate editorial staff—continued under the Des Moines Register and Tribune Company. By 1927 the two remaining local competitors, the Daily News and the Capital, had merged with the Tribune, which was later discontinued.
The Des Moines Register became famous for its editorials, its outstanding statewide news coverage, and its editorial cartoons. Its editorial cartoonist, Jay Norwood (“Ding”) Darling, was widely syndicated in the early 20th century and brought the Register its first Pulitzer Prize in 1924; by 2010 the paper had earned 16 Pulitzers. In 1925 Cowles engaged statistician George Gallup to survey reader preferences—a precursor to the Gallup Poll of public opinion. In 1985 the paper was bought by the Gannett Co., Inc.
