Yomiuri shimbun,  Japanese national daily newspaper, the largest in circulation and the most sensational in editorial style of Japan’s “big three” dailies.
Yomiuri was founded in 1874, one of five new dailies created early in the Meiji period (1868–1912) to meet the need for a vernacular newspaper in the rapidly modernizing society of Japan. Yomiuri (“selling by reading”) was the practice of news vendors of the Tokugawa period (1603–1867), who hawked newssheets, printed from hand-graven blocks before the advent of movable type, by reading them aloud.
Like its more sedate rivals Asahi and Mainichi, Yomiuri has five regional morning and evening editions plus an English-language edition in Tokyo. Yomiuri was consciously influenced by the journalistic style of the American papers of William Randolph Hearst, Sr., in the early decades of the 20th century. The paper’s main appeal is to working-class readers. The paper also established the first professional baseball team in Japan (now called the Yomiuri Giants), which helped to increase its circulation.
