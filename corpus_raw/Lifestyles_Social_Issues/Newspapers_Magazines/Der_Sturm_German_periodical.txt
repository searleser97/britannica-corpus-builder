Der Sturm,  (German: “The Assault”), a periodical and later a gallery—both established by Herwarth Walden in the early 20th century in Berlin—devoted to the newest trends in art. The first issue of Der Sturm, published in 1910 as a weekly for literature and criticism, contained drawings by Oskar Kokoschka; the following year, the works of Die Brücke artists were featured; and in 1912, writings, drawings, and prints by members of the Der Blaue Reiter group appeared. In March 1912, in connection with the 100th issue of Der Sturm, Walden opened his Galerie Der Sturm with an exhibition of works primarily by French Fauvists and Der Blaue Reiter artists. The following month he introduced the work of the Italian Futurists to Germany. By the end of 1913 the work of such major artists as Edvard Munch, Georges Braque, Pablo Picasso, Robert Delaunay, Gino Severini, Jean Arp, Paul Klee, and Alexander Archipenko had been exhibited, and Der Sturm’s First German Autumn Salon of that year was highly successful.
Der Sturm published deluxe portfolios of graphic works by artists such as Kandinsky and Kokoschka, as well as original woodcuts, postcards, picture books, and large colour reproductions of works by gallery artists. By 1918 Der Sturm’s activities had been extended into several other areas: Walden initiated the Sturmabende, salons devoted to lectures and discussions on the visual arts and poetry; the Sturmschule, a school for theatrical arts, painting, poetry, and music; and the Sturmbühne, an experimental Expressionist theatre.
During the peak of its activity, Der Sturm was the centre of modern art in Berlin. Despite its numerous enterprises, its importance diminished in the 1920s. The gallery closed in 1924, and the periodical (from 1914, a monthly) became a quarterly until it ceased publication in 1932.
