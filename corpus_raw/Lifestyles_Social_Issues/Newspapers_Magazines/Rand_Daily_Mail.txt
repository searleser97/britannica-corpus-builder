Rand Daily Mail,   former English-language newspaper published in Johannesburg. It crusaded against South Africaâ€™s racial segregation but, because of financial losses, ceased publication in 1985. 
The Rand Daily Mail, founded in 1902, pioneered in popular journalism, introducing illustrations and cartoons, entertainment features, and improved layout. In later years the paper became known for its generally antigovernment policy, reflecting the view of the small liberal-oriented Progressive Party. In the 1960s the Rand Daily Mail led newspaper attacks on conditions in prisons and on other aspects of South African life, despite increased restrictions placed on the paper by the government. By the time of its demise, it had a readership that was two-thirds black.
