Journal de Genève,  daily newspaper published in Geneva, Switzerland. Among French-language newspapers it was generally regarded as the best in Switzerland and one of the premier papers in the world. It was established in 1826.
Like the German-language Neue Zürcher Zeitung, the Journal de Genève was a national newspaper, serious in tone and generally liberal in outlook. Its careful and thorough treatment of Swiss and international affairs brought the paper wide prestige despite its relatively small circulation. Of tabloid size, the Journal de Genève was published every day except Sunday. In 1998 it merged with Le Nouveau Quotidien to form Le Temps.
