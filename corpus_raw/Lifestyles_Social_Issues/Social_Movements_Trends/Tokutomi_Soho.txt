Tokutomi Sohō, pseudonym of Tokutomi Ichirō,  (born March 14, 1863, Tsumori, near Minamata, Japan—died  Nov. 2, 1957, Atami), influential Japanese historian, critic, journalist, and essayist and a leading nationalist writer before World War II.
Tokutomi received a Western-style education at the missionary school of Dōshisha (now Dōshisha University) in Kyōto, after which he entered upon a journalistic and literary career. In 1887 he founded a publishing house, Min’yūsha (“Society of the People’s Friends”). In 1887 this firm began a highly influential periodical, Kokumin no tomo (“Nation’s Friend”), that was Japan’s first general magazine. Min’yūsha in 1890 began printing Kokumn shimbun (“The Nation Newspaper”), which was for several decades one of the most influential papers in the country.
Tokutomi was particularly concerned with the modernization of Japan, and, in such influential early books as Shōrai no Nihon (1886; “The Future Japan”), he advocated that Western-style liberal and democratic reforms be undertaken in his country. In the following decades, however, he became a militant nationalist in favour of an imperialistic Japan, and during the 1920s and ’30s he was one of the nation’s most popular spokesmen for this ideal. Tokutomi was placed under house arrest by the American occupation authorities after World War II. His 100-volume Kinsei Nihon kokumin shi (1918–52; “A History of Early Modern Japan”), despite its ultranationalistic bias, is an exhaustive and invaluable compendium of events in Japan from the late 16th to the late 19th century.
