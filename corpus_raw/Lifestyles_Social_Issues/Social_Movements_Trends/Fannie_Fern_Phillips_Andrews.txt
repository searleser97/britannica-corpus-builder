Fannie Fern Phillips Andrews, née Fannie Fern Phillips,  (born Sept. 25, 1867, Margaretville, N.S., Can.—died Jan. 23, 1950, Somerville, Mass., U.S.),  Canadian-born American pacifist and writer, a tireless advocate, nationally and internationally, for education and peace.
Fannie Phillips grew up in Nova Scotia and, from about 1876, in Lynn, Massachusetts. She graduated from the Salem Normal School (now Salem State College) in 1884 and taught school in Lynn until her marriage to Edwin G. Andrews in July 1890. In 1895 and 1896 she attended summer school at Harvard University, and in 1902 she graduated from Radcliffe College. Deeply interested in education and reform, she formed in Boston in 1905 one of the earliest school-affiliated parents’ organizations. This was followed in 1907 by the Boston Home and School Association, of which she served as secretary and, in 1914–18, president.
In 1908 she combined her interests in schools and pacifism in organizing the American School Peace League. Through her remarkable talents for publicizing and enlisting support, the league grew rapidly throughout the country. Pacifist literature and study courses produced by the league, much of the material written by Andrews, were circulated widely and in 1912 began to be distributed by the U.S. Bureau of Education, with which she was associated until 1921 as a special collaborator. On a trip to Great Britain in 1914 she helped organize the similar School Peace League. The American League changed its name in 1918 to the American School Citizenship League, and Andrews remained secretary until her death. World War I turned her attention to the establishment of international organizations to preserve peace. Through the Central Organization for a Durable Peace, which she helped found at The Hague in 1915, she conducted studies of international problems and published The Freedom of the Seas (1917), while through the School Citizenship League and the League to Enforce Peace she distributed literature on international organization. In 1919 she wrote A Course in Foreign Relations for the army’s educational commission.
Andrews supported President Woodrow Wilson’s League of Nations plan, and she attended the Paris Peace Conference as a representative of the U.S. Bureau of Education and the New England Women’s Press Association. Her plan for a bureau of education in the League of Nations was rejected at the time, but an International Bureau of Education was formed in Geneva in 1925, and she sat thereafter on its advisory board. President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed Andrews to represent the United States at its third and fifth international conferences on public instruction in 1934 and 1936. In 1923 she was awarded a Ph.D. by Radcliffe for a study of the postwar mandate system, and in 1925 she traveled through the Middle East to study the system firsthand. Her two-volume The Holy Land Under Mandate (1931) was well regarded by scholars. Andrews was also active in the American Association of University Women, chairing its international relations committee in 1925–32. Her Memory Pages of My Life was published in 1948.
