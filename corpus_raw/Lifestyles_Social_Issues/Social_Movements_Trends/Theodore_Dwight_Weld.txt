Theodore Dwight Weld,  (born November 23, 1803, Hampton, Connecticut, U.S.—died February 3, 1895, Hyde Park, Massachusetts), American antislavery crusader in the pre-Civil War period.
While a ministerial student at Lane Seminary, Cincinnati, Ohio, Weld participated in antislavery debates and led a group of students who withdrew from Lane to enroll at Oberlin (Ohio) College. Weld left his studies in 1834 to become an agent for the American Anti-Slavery Society, recruiting and training people to work for the cause. His converts included such well-known abolitionists as James G. Birney, Harriet Beecher Stowe, and Henry Ward Beecher.
Weld wrote pamphlets (largely anonymous), notably The Bible Against Slavery (1837) and Slavery As It Is (1839). The latter was said to be the work on which Harriet Beecher Stowe partly based her Uncle Tom’s Cabin.
Soon after his marriage (1838) to Angelina Grimké, a coworker in the antislavery crusade, Weld withdrew to private life on a farm in Belleville, New Jersey. He ventured back into public life in 1841–43, when he went to Washington, D.C., to head an antislavery reference bureau for the group of insurgents in Congress who broke with the Whigs on the slavery issue and were seeking the repeal of the “gag rule” restricting the consideration of antislavery petitions in Congress. Having demonstrated the value of an antislavery lobby in Washington, Weld returned to private life. He and his wife spent the remainder of their lives directing schools and teaching in New Jersey and Massachusetts.
