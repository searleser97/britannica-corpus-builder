Count Aleksander Wielopolski,  (born March 13, 1803, Sedziejowice, near Pińczów, Pol., Russian Empire—died  Dec. 30, 1877, Dresden, Ger.), Polish statesman who undertook a program of major internal reforms coupled with full submission to Russian domination in order to gain maximum national autonomy.
Born into an impoverished noble family, he studied law as a young man in Warsaw and philosophy in Germany. Returning to Poland, he brought a series of sensational lawsuits against the purchasers of his family’s ancestral estates. In 1831, during a revolt against Russian rule, the Polish insurrectionary government sent him to London to ask for British aid, which was refused. When the revolt collapsed, Wielopolski quietly retired to private life.
In 1846 Wielopolski published a pamphlet in which he argued that Poland ought to abandon all dreams of independence and sincerely submit to Russian rule. The Russians, pleased by his attitude, allowed him to enter the government, in which he sought with some success to gain more autonomy for Poland. When popular disturbances broke out in 1861, he was appointed by the Russians to head the civil government in Poland. He proceeded to purge the administration of Russian officials, reform the educational system, emancipate the Jewish minority, and enact laws aimed at relieving the peasants of oppressive obligations to the landowners.
At the same time Wielopolski relentlessly fought against revolutionaries. His order for the compulsory enrollment of all dissidents into the Russian Army precipitated another insurrection, finally crushed by the Russian Army. Wielopolski’s program was wrecked, and he retired to private life in July 1863 and later emigrated to Dresden.
