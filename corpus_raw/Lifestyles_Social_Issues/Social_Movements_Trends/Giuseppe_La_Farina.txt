Giuseppe La Farina,  (born July 20, 1815, Messina, Sicily, kingdom of Naples [now in Italy]—died  Sept. 5, 1863, Turin, Italy), Italian revolutionary, writer, and leader and historian of the Risorgimento.
The son of a Sicilian magistrate and scholar, La Farina received a law degree in 1835 and soon became involved with a secret committee for Italian unity; he was forced into exile after it attempted an insurrection in 1837. Receiving amnesty in 1838, he returned to Messina and took up literary work, while also engaging in revolutionary work in Naples and Palermo.
In Florence after 1841, La Farina lived by his pen; in 1847 he founded the political journal L’Alba. At the outbreak of revolution in 1848, he returned to Messina, served successively as deputy and secretary to the chamber of communes at Palermo, minister of public instruction and public works, and minister of war and the navy. But he was exiled again in April, when the revolution failed, and he remained in Paris until 1853, when he returned to Turin. In 1857 he helped found the Italian National Society, a nationalist organization.
After 1857 he was in frequent secret contact with the unification leader Count Cavour, planning annexation demands and policy and organizing military moves. Although he helped to furnish Sicilian funds for Giuseppe Garibaldi’s conquest of Sicily and Naples in 1860, La Farina lost favour with Garibaldi when he began circulating an annexationist paper in Palermo called L’Annessione, and he was arrested and deported to Genoa in July 1860. Earlier that year, he had been elected to the Chamber of Deputies, and he later became a councillor of state.
La Farina’s greatest literary work was the Storia d’Italia dal 1815 al 1850 (1851–52), which included a discussion of Italy’s future as a nation. His letters have been collected and edited by Ausonio Franchi in the two-volume Epistolario di Giuseppe La Farina (1869). La Farina’s other works include the two-volume Studi sul secolo XIII (1841; “Study of the 13th Century”), the 10-volume Storia d’Italia (1846; “History of Italy”), and Rivoluzione siciliana nel 1848 e 49 (1851; “Sicilian Revolution in 1848–49”).
