Edward Cardwell, Viscount Cardwell,  (born July 24, 1813, Liverpool, Eng.—died Feb. 15, 1886, Torquay, Devon), British statesman who, as secretary of state for war (1868–74), was considered to be the greatest British military reformer of the 19th century, modernizing the organization and equipment of the British army in the face of strenuous opposition at home.
The son of a Liverpool merchant, Cardwell was educated at Winchester and at Balliol College, Oxford. A lawyer from 1838 and a member of the House of Commons from 1842, he served as president of the Board of Trade (1852–55), chief secretary for Ireland (1859–61), chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster (1861–64), and secretary for the colonies (1864–66). In 1868 William Gladstone, on becoming prime minister, gave Cardwell the War Office.
Concerned with improving conditions for the private soldier, Cardwell, in 1868, abolished flogging as a military punishment in peacetime. Two years later, he shortened the army enlistment term from 12 years’ active service (it had been 21 years from 1815 to 1847) to six years’ active duty and six years’ reserve obligation, making possible for the first time in Great Britain a large, well-prepared reserve of reasonably young men. These and other measures so stimulated enlistments that the payment of “bounty money” (recruitment bonuses) was abolished in 1870. Cardwell was also responsible for introducing the system of linked battalions, with one at home and one overseas. His comprehensive pairing of battalions in 1881 laid the modern foundation of the British army’s regimental system.
In 1871, over the almost unanimous opposition of senior officers, Cardwell succeeded in abolishing the purchase of military commissions. That system had allowed generations of rich men and their sons to attain high ranks for which they were wholly unfitted and thereby had retarded the progress of competent career officers. On leaving office with Gladstone in 1874, Cardwell was created a viscount. The almost effortless British conquest of Egypt in 1882 is believed to have demonstrated the value of his reforms.
Cardwell died without surviving issue, and his peerage became extinct.
