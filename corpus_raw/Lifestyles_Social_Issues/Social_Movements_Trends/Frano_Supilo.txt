Frano Supilo,  (born Nov. 30, 1870, Cavtat, Dalmatia, Austria-Hungary [now in Croatia]—died  Sept. 23, 1917, London, Eng.), Croatian journalist and politician who opposed Austro-Hungarian domination before World War I and played a significant role in the controversies preceding the formation of an independent Yugoslav state.
As editor of Novi List, a Croatian journal he founded in 1900 at Rijeka, Supilo worked to promote Croatian-Serbian interests in opposition to Habsburg supremacy. In 1905 he drew up the Rijeka Resolution designed to create a Croat-Serb coalition, which he hoped would bring about an alliance with anti-Habsburg Hungarians. In an effort to discredit the coalition, Austro-Hungarian authorities provided the publicist Heinrich Friedjung with documents alleging that Supilo and his associates were working on behalf of Serbia. The latter sued Friedjung, and at the trial (1909) it was demonstrated that the documents were forgeries. Nevertheless, Supilo resigned as president of the coalition.
After the outbreak of World War I, Supilo supported the Allied cause and, together with the Croatian nationalist Ante Trumbić and Ivan Meštrović, a noted sculptor, founded the Yugoslav Committee in London (1915) with the purpose of liberating the South Slavs. A period of difficult negotiations followed involving the British and French promise to Italy of territories along the eastern Adriatic in the secret Treaty of London (1915), while the South Slavs debated between themselves over the nature of the future Yugoslav state. When Supilo insisted that a constitution precede unification, he was outvoted. Although he resigned from the committee over that issue, he later endorsed the Declaration of Corfu (July 20, 1917), whereby the South Slavic peoples would form a single kingdom (later called Yugoslavia).
