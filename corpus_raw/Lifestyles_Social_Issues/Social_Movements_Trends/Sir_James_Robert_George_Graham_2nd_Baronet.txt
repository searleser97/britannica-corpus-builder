Sir James Graham, 2nd Baronet,  (born June 1, 1792, Netherby, Cumberland, Eng.—died  Oct. 25, 1861, Netherby), British politician, confidant and adviser of prime minister Sir Robert Peel, and the leading Peelite in the House of Commons after Peel’s death (1850).
Graham was a member of the House of Commons from 1826 until his death. He was originally an advanced liberal member of the Whig Party, and he helped draft the first British electoral reform bill (1832). As first lord of the Admiralty (1830–34) in the 2nd Earl Grey’s ministry, he reformed (1832) the administration of the Royal Navy. His radicalism quickly waned during this period, however, and in 1835 he left the Whigs and soon emerged as Peel’s most valuable lieutenant in the Commons. As home secretary in Peel’s second ministry (1841–46), he supported the repeal of the Corn Laws (tariffs on imported grain).
When Peel died in 1850, Graham became the leading Peelite in the Commons and helped promote the Whig-Peelite coalition government (1852–55) of the 4th Earl of Aberdeen, in which Graham once more served as first lord of the Admiralty. He resigned in 1855 shortly after the formation of the 3rd Viscount Palmerston’s first ministry.
Graham was an able administrator and a highly influential adviser to both Peel and such younger politicians as William Gladstone, but his somewhat unattractive personal character hindered him from attaining the success his abilities merited.
