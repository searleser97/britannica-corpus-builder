Antirent War,  (1839–46), in U.S. history, civil unrest and rioting in upper New York state arising from the dissatisfaction of leaseholding farmers over the patroon system then prevailing on the great hereditary estates, originally established by the Dutch. In addition to rent, a farmer had to provide certain services to the landowner; the farmer’s position was similar to that of a copyholder or villein under European feudalism. On the sale of the lease, a New York farmer had to pay the proprietor an alienation fine of from one-tenth to one-third of the sale price.
While this system had long been considered unjust, no direct action was taken until 1839, when the heirs of Stephen Van Rensselaer tried to collect back rent from leaseholders in Albany County. The farmers rose in active opposition and refused to pay. Violence broke out and Gov. William H. Seward called out the militia. But acts of resistance spread, especially against rent and tax collectors, and Gov. Silas Wright declared martial law in August 1845. Thereafter, the disturbances lessened, and they finally ceased when a new state constitution in 1846 abolished the leasehold system of land tenure and instituted fee-simple ownership.
