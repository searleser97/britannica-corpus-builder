Apolinario Mabini,  (born July 23, 1864, Talaga, Phil.—died  May 13, 1903, Manila), Filipino theoretician and spokesman of the Philippine Revolution, who wrote the constitution for the short-lived republic of 1898–99.
Born into a peasant family, Mabini studied at San Juan de Letran College in Manila and won a law degree from the University of Santo Tomás in 1894. In an insurrection organized in August 1896 by nationalists, he joined the forces of the patriot general Emilio Aguinaldo and soon became his right-hand man. When the Spanish–American War broke out in 1898, Mabini urged cooperation with the United States as a means to gain freedom from Spain. At a convention held at the market town of Malolos in September and October 1898, an independent republic was proclaimed with Aguinaldo as its president; Mabini drew up its constitution, which resembled that of the United States. When the United States announced, however, that it would annex the Philippines, Mabini joined Aguinaldo in a renewed struggle for independence. He was captured by U.S. troops in December 1899 and, because he refused to swear allegiance to the United States, was exiled to Guam, not being allowed to return home until a few months before his death. Mabini wrote La revolución filipina, which was published in 1931.
