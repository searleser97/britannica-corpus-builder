Dom Joseph Pothier,  (born Dec. 7, 1835, Bouzemont, Fr.—died  Dec. 8, 1923, Conques, Belg.), French monk and scholar who, together with his contemporaries, reconstituted the Gregorian chant.
Pothier took vows as a Benedictine monk at Solesmes in 1860, was prior of Ligugé in 1893, and in 1898 was appointed abbot of Saint-Wandrille. Soon after he entered Solesmes he collaborated with Dom Paul Jausions on a new edition of the choir books based on manuscripts of the Gregorian chant. Dom Jausions died in 1870, but his contribution was acknowledged in the preface to Dom Pothier’s publication Les Mélodies grégoriennes d’après la tradition (1880), which became the standard work on the subject. In 1883 he published the Liber gradualis, which also included research earlier undertaken by Dom Jausions and which, with the Mélodies grégoriennes, marked the beginning of a reform in liturgical chant. In 1889 he was associated with his disciple Dom André Mocquereau (1849–1930) in the foundation of the publication Paléographie musicale for the dissemination of medieval liturgical manuscripts. In 1904 Pope Pius X appointed him chairman of a commission for the reconstitution of the music of the Roman Catholic Mass. Many of the controversial theories regarding the intervention of Gregorian chant were published in the Revue du chant grégorien (1892–1914), of which Dom Pothier was editor.
