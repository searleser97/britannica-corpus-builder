German National People’s Party, German Deutschnationale Volkspartei (DNVP),  right-wing political party active in the Reichstag (assembly) of the Weimar Republic of Germany from 1919 to 1933. Representing chauvinistic opinion hostile to the republic and to the Allies’ reparation demands following World War I, it supported the restoration of monarchy, a united Germany, and private enterprise. It gathered strength in the elections of 1920 (66 Reichstag seats) and was at its height in the two elections of 1924, with 106 and 111 seats, respectively. In 1923–28 representatives of the Nationalists’ more moderate section were brought into cabinets but were later forced out by the opposition of the party’s irreconcilables, led by Alfred Hugenberg. During the domestic controversy over war reparations to the Allies (1929–30), the Nationalist Party, under Hugenberg, allied with the Nazi Party in organizing a plebiscite in favour of stopping payments. This led to establishment of a major financial link between the Nazis and the wealthy industrialists supporting the Nationalists. The Nationalists were among those who opposed the government of Heinrich Brüning and helped paralyze the Weimar regime in its last days. When Adolf Hitler eventually became chancellor (Jan. 30, 1933), it was in a coalition that included the Nationalists. After the elections of March 5, 1933, the party’s deputies helped give Hitler his narrow voting majority in the Reichstag. The Nationalist deputies, with those of the Centre Party and the Nazis, voted for the Enabling Act of March 23, 1933, which enabled Hitler to assume dictatorial powers. The DNVP, along with all other German political parties except the Nazi Party, was dissolved in the summer of 1933, and Hugenberg was forced to resign from the Cabinet.
