Vincas Kudirka,  (born Dec. 31, 1858, Paezeriai, Lithuania, Russian Empire—died  Nov. 6, 1899, Naumiestis [now Kudirkos-Naumiestis]), Lithuanian physician, writer, and patriot who, through an underground literary-political journal, Varpas (1889–1905; “The Bell”), articulated a broadly representative protest against Russian attempts to submerge the awakening national culture of its Lithuanian provinces.
Educated in medicine, as well as in history and philosophy, Kudirka was working as a physician when, in 1889, he founded Varpas, to which he soon devoted his full energies. Varpas, published in Tilsit, Prussia, and smuggled into the Russian Empire, offered poems and satires by Kudirka and others, as well as vociferous attacks on tsarist Russification policies. The journal also stirred social reform and was influential in liberal and socialist circles.
Kudirka translated the works of the 19th-century Romantic poets Lord Byron (English), Friedrich Schiller (German), and Adam Mickiewicz (Polish) into Lithuanian. His satires were influenced by the Russian writers Nikolay Gogol, Nikolay Nekrasov, and Count Mikhail Yevgrafovich Saltykov (N. Shchedrin). The first harmonizer of Lithuanian folk songs, Kudirka was also the author of the Lithuanian national anthem. The city of his death, Naumiestis, was later renamed for him.
