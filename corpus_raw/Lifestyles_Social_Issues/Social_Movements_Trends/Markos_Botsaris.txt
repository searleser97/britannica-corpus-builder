Markos Botsaris, Italian Marco Bozzari,  (born c. 1788, Soúli, Ottoman Empire [now in Greece]—died  Aug. 21, 1823, Karpenisíon), an important leader early in the Greek War of Independence.
Botsaris’ early years were spent in the struggle between the Souliots of southern Epirus (Modern Greek: Íperos) and Ali Paşa, who had made himself ruler of Ioánnina (Janina) in Epirus in 1788. After Ali Paşa succeeded in capturing the Souliot strongholds in 1803, Botsaris and most of his surviving clansmen fled to Corfu (Kérkyra). He remained there for 16 years, serving in an Albanian regiment under French command. Strongly influenced by the European ideas of national independence and identity, he joined the patriotic society Philikí Etaireía in 1814.
Botsaris returned to Epirus with the Souliots in 1820 to join his former enemy Ali Paşa of Ioánnina in his revolt against the Turkish government and, after Ali Paşa was defeated, committed the Souliots to the Greek struggle for independence that had broken out in April 1821. After serving in the successful defense of the town of Missolonghi (Mesolóngion) during the first siege in 1822–23, he led a band of a few hundred Souliot guerrillas on the night of Aug. 21, 1823, in a bold attack on 4,000 Albanians encamped at Karpenisíon.
The Albanians, who formed the vanguard of a Turkish army advancing to join the siege, were routed, but Botsaris, who had proved to be one of the most promising commanders of the Greek forces, was killed. When Botsaris died, his command of the Souliots passed to his friend Lord Byron, who formed 50 of them into a personal bodyguard at Missolonghi.
