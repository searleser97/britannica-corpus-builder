Kazys Grinius,  (born Dec. 17, 1866, Salema, near Marijampole, Lithuania, Russian Empire—died  June 4, 1950, Chicago), Lithuanian patriot and statesman who was active in the struggle for independence from Russia and served as prime minister (1920–23) and president (1926) of the republic during the period of liberal democracy.
Grinius studied medicine in Moscow and from 1894 practiced in several Lithuanian towns. He contributed articles to the clandestine patriotic and liberal publication Varpas (1889–1905; “The Bell”) and was one of the founders of the Lithuanian Democrat (Liberal) Party in 1902. Before World War I his house at Marijampole was a gathering place for Lithuanian democrats, and he was persecuted by the tsarist Russian government.
After World War I, as a leader of the Lithuanian Peasant Populist Party, Grinius was a member of the Lithuanian constituent assembly. On June 8, 1920, he formed a Cabinet that on June 12 signed a peace treaty with the Soviet Union. He resigned as prime minister on Feb. 1, 1922. On June 7, 1926, he was elected president of Lithuania and served until the military coup d’etat in favour of a Nationalist government on December 17. He then resumed his medical practice in Kaunas.
When the Germans invaded Lithuania in 1941 he refused an invitation to take part in a German-controlled government, courageously condemning Nazi persecution of Lithuanian Jews. He escaped the Soviet occupation in 1944 by fleeing to Germany and went to the United States in 1947.
