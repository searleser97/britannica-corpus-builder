Herman, Count Wedel-Jarlsberg,  (born Sept. 2, 1779, Montpellier, Fr.—died Aug. 27, 1840, Christiania, Nor.), Norwegian patriot and statesman. He was the leading advocate of Norwegian-Swedish union in the last years of the Danish-Norwegian state and the first Norwegian governor (statholder) in the Norwegian-Swedish union (1814–1905).
Early in the 19th century, as the Danish-Norwegian state was disintegrating under the strains of the Napoleonic Wars, Wedel-Jarlsberg served with distinction on a special Norwegian commission set up to sustain the nation while it was cut off by the British naval blockade from the vital services and supplies of Denmark. Successfully supplying food for the country in these years was his most notable feat. His experience convinced him that Norway’s interests could best be secured in union with Sweden.
When Denmark ceded Norway to Sweden by the terms of the Treaty of Kiel (January 1814), Wedel headed the “Union party,” which favoured some sort of affiliation with the Swedes. The majority “Independent party,” however, was established to defy the Kiel treaty and to achieve complete independence for Norway. Wedel’s group joined the majority at the April 10, 1814, constituent assembly at Eidsvold, and he sat on the “Committee of Fifteen,” which drafted the constitution. Military resistance to the Swedes in the summer of 1814 proved futile; and a compromise was reached, resulting in a personal union of the two states that lasted until 1905.
After the formation of the union, Wedel served as finance minister in the Norwegian government, always vigilant of Norway’s status in the dual state. In 1836 he was the first Norwegian to become governor of Norway within the union.
