Hoa Hao, in full Phat Giao Hoa Hao,  Vietnamese Buddhist religious movement that was formed in 1939 by the Buddhist reformer Huynh Phu So. The Hoa Hao, along with the syncretic religious group Cao Dai, was one of the first groups to initiate armed hostilities against the French and later the Japanese colonialists.
Based in the prosperous Mekong River delta area of southern Vietnam, where its adherents were mostly peasants, tenants, and rural workers, the Hoa Hao grew rapidly during the Japanese occupation in World War II. After the war, it continued as an independent force in Vietnamese politics, opposing both the French colonialists and the Viet Minh nationalist movement of Ho Chi Minh. After 1954 the Hoa Hao and Cao Dai began armed opposition to the U.S.-backed government of President Ngo Dinh Diem. At the time of Diemâ€™s death in 1963, the Hoa Hao had control of several southern and western provinces of South Vietnam. Though many Hoa Hao adherents joined the communist-backed National Liberation Front in the late 1960s, the Hoa Hao remained a powerful independent force in South Vietnamese politics until the final victory of the communists in 1975.
