De Tham, also called Hoang Hoa Tham,  (born c. 1860, Yen The, northern Vietnam—died  Jan. 10, 1913, near Yen The), Vietnamese resistance fighter and enemy of French colonialism during the first two decades of French rule in Indochina.
Hoang Hoa Tham’s family name was originally Truong; his parents were opponents of the Nguyen rulers of Vietnam. His mother was executed, and his father committed suicide after an antiroyalist plot in which they were involved failed. With a paternal uncle, Hoang Hoa Tham fled to the mountainous area around Yen The in northern Vietnam, where the entire family adopted the Hoang name. Later, under the name De Tham, he joined local insurgent pirate bands and became renowned for his bravery and cunning tactics. He organized anti-French guerrilla forces and became a formidable threat to the European colonialists, who spread exaggerated stories about his ferocity and ruthlessness. Among his own people De Tham became an almost legendary figure. In 1885 he was joined by the maternal great-uncle of the future Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh.
In 1894 De Tham reached temporary accord with the French whereby he secured the area around Yen The as his own private autonomous domain. Trouble continued, however, as De Tham strove to expand his holdings; but the French ignored his threats. In 1908 De Tham collaborated with other nationalists in an abortive attempt to kill French guests at a banquet. Thereafter he was a hunted man with a price on his head. He was finally assassinated by three Chinese who were among his followers.
De Tham became a legend among the French, who romanticized his exploits in many popular books.
