Christian Jensen Lofthuus,  (baptized May 15, 1750, Risør, Nor.—died June 13, 1797, Christiania [now Oslo]), leader of a reform movement who sought redress for the grievances of Norway’s peasantry from the absolutist Danish-Norwegian government. His imprisonment and death made him a martyr for Norwegian agrarian reform.
Lofthuus first journeyed to Denmark in June 1786 to present the peasants’ grievances on taxes, official corruption, and exploitation to the crown prince. Told to return to Norway and to demonstrate public support, an action that could have led to his arrest for agitating against the crown, Lofthuus gathered a petition committee and attempted to return to Denmark in November 1786. The issuance of an arrest warrant, however, caused him to seek refuge in the more remote peasant villages. While southern Norway’s peasants prepared to organize resistance to his arrest, he was taken into custody in March 1787 and imprisoned in the fortress of Akershus in Christiania. A peasant rising, which was quickly put down, led, however, to some reforms in 1788. Lofthuus died in prison.
