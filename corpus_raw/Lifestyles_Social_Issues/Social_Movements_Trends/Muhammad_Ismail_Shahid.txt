Muḥammad Ismāʿīl Shahīd,  (born April 29, 1779, Phulat, India—died  May 6, 1831, Balakote), Indian Muslim reformer who attempted to purge Indian Islam from idolatry and who preached holy war against the Sikhs and the British.
As a preacher in Delhi, Ismāʿīl Shahīd attracted attention as a young man for his forceful preaching against such popular superstitions as grave worship, the veneration of saints, and other practices regarded as heretical. Returning from a pilgrimage to Mecca in 1823, he began to preach holy war (jihad) against the Sikhs who had been oppressing their Muslim subjects. In 1824–26 Ismāʿīl accompanied a voluntary force of Muslim warriors led by Sayyid Aḥmad to fight a holy war against the Sikhs in the Punjab. Ismāʿīl assumed leadership of the mujāhidīn (holy warriors) in 1830, when they were driven out of their stronghold of Peshāwar. The Muslims went down to death before a superior Sikh force at the battle of Balakote, on May 6, 1831, where Ismāʿīl lost his life.
