Tianshidao, (Chinese: “Way of the Celestial Masters”) Wade-Giles romanization T’ien-shi-tao, byname Wudoumi (“Five Pecks of Rice”),  great popular Daoist movement that occurred near the end of China’s Han dynasty (206 bce–220 ce) and greatly weakened the government. The Tianshidao movement became a prototype of the religiously inspired popular rebellions that were to erupt periodically throughout China for the next 2,000 years.
The movement was begun early in the 2nd century ce by Zhang Daoling, considered the founder and first patriarch of Daoism in China. Zhang, who began his career as a faith healer, claimed to have received a revelation from the Daoist sage Laozi and sought to inaugurate a time called Great Peace (Taiping). His movement took its byname, “Five Pecks of Rice” (Wudoumi), from the five pecks of rice a year that clients paid him either for their cure or as dues. Zhang was succeeded as tianshi (“celestial master”) by his son Zhang Heng, who was in turn succeeded by his son Zhang Lu.
By Zhang Lu’s time, poverty and misery had become endemic to the peasantry of central China. Taking advantage of the resulting discontent, Zhang Lu formed his own army and set up an independent theocratic state, which established free wayside inns for travelers, dealt leniently with criminals, and promoted the spread of Daoism. In developing this state, Zhang Lu was joined by another Daoist leader, Zhang Xiu (no relation). Together they managed to extend the rebellion until it covered most of present-day Sichuan province. But the two leaders eventually came into conflict with each other, and Zhang Lu killed Zhang Xiu. In 215 ce Zhang Lu surrendered to the great Han general Cao Cao, who rewarded him with high rank and a princely fief.
