Antonio Maura y Montaner,  (born May 2, 1853, Palma, Majorca, Spain—died December 13, 1925, Torrelodones), statesman and five-time prime minister of Spain whose vision led him to undertake a series of democratic reforms to prevent revolution and foster a constitutional monarchy. His tolerance and lack of knowledge of human nature, however, tended to obscure his otherwise brilliant political career.
Maura was elected to the Cortes (Spanish parliament) of 1881, and in 1890 he became minister for the colonies in the Liberal cabinet of Práxedes Mateo Sagasta. He resigned when his reforms that would have granted autonomy to Cuba failed to pass (1894). Later, as minister of the interior (1902), he conducted elections notable for their honesty. That year he abandoned the Liberals and joined the Conservative Party.
Maura first became premier in December 1903 but resigned a year later in protest against what he thought was an attempt by King Alfonso XIII to seize personal power. During his second tenure as premier in 1907–09, Maura was able to pass some of his projects, such as reforming local governments and making education compulsory. However, his attempt to promote Spanish political influence and commercial interests in Morocco provoked the Rif War, which set off a general strike (July 1909) and anticlerical violence in Barcelona. After the execution of the propagandist Francisco Ferrer, which provoked major protests across Europe, many of Maura’s followers adopted more authoritarian political positions, but he never agreed formally to support them. Although Maura reestablished the constitutional guarantees in Barcelona and Gerona, he was forced to resign as prime minister in October.
In December 1912 Maura resigned his seat in the Cortes as well as his post of Conservative Party leader. He headed three more short-lived governments in periods of crisis: March–November 1913, April–July 1919, and August 1921–March 1922.
