C. Wright Mills, in full Charles Wright Mills,  (born August 28, 1916, Waco, Texas, U.S.—died March 20, 1962, Nyack, New York), American sociologist who, with Hans H. Gerth, applied and popularized Max Weber’s theories in the United States. He also applied Karl Mannheim’s theories on the sociology of knowledge to the political thought and behaviour of intellectuals.
Mills received his A.B. and A.M. from the University of Texas in 1939 and his Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin in 1941; he joined the sociology faculty at Columbia University in 1946. At Columbia, Mills promoted the idea that social scientists should not merely be disinterested observers engaged in research and theory but assert their social responsibility. He was concerned about the ethics of his sociological peers, feeling that they often failed to affirm moral leadership and thus surrendered their social responsibility and allowed special interests, or people lacking qualifications, to assume positions of leadership.
Mills’s work drew heavily from Weber’s differentiation between the various impacts of class, status, and power in explaining stratification systems and politics. His analysis of the major echelons of American society appeared in The New Men of Power, America’s Labor Leaders (1948), White Collar (1951), and his best-known work, The Power Elite (1956). In this last book, Mills located the “elite,” or ruling class, among those business, government, and military leaders whose decisions and actions have significant consequences.
Among his sociological works were Character and Social Structure (1953; with H.H. Gerth) and The Sociological Imagination (1959), a critical evaluation of the status of sociology.
Two generally sympathetic intellectual biographies are Radical Ambition: C. Wright Mills, the Left, and American Social Thought (2009) by Daniel Geary and Taking It Big: C. Wright Mills and the Making of Political Intellectuals (2012) by Stanley Aronowitz.
