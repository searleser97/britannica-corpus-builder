Christian Magnus Falsen,  (born September 14, 1782, Christiania [now Oslo], Norway—died January 13, 1830, Christiania), nationalist political leader, generally regarded as the author of the Norwegian constitution.
Falsen was among those who assembled at the Norwegian village of Eidsvold (now Eidsvoll) on April 10, 1814, to attempt to undo the results of the Treaty of Kiel (January 14, 1814), by which Denmark ceded Norway to Sweden. They met to frame a declaration of independence and a constitution and to determine what action to take against Sweden. Falsen led a majority Independent Party that wanted complete independence and was prepared to resist Sweden militarily. There was also a small Union Party that wanted a personal union with Sweden—a dual monarchy.
With an associate, Falsen had drafted a quite liberal constitution before the assembly met. That document served as a guide for the constitution committee, of which he was chairman. Although the more radical clauses were deleted in the final draft (the present Norwegian constitution), he became known as the “father of the constitution.” In the summer of 1814 his party put up a futile military resistance to the Swedes. The Swedes, however, rather than insist on annexation, accepted a personal union with Norway (1814–1905) and also agreed to the maintenance of the Norwegian constitution with modifications. Falsen took a seat in the Storting (parliament) and began to favour a more conservative political position. After the Storting in 1824 rejected an amendment by him that would have greatly restricted the franchise, his career ended in a wave of vilification.
