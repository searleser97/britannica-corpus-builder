Johan Laidoner,  (born February 12, 1884, Viiratsi, near Viljandi, Estonia, Russian Empire—died March 13, 1953, Vladimir, Russia, U.S.S.R.), Estonian soldier and patriot who led the Estonian liberation army in 1918 and supported the authoritarian regime of Konstantin Päts in the 1930s.
Educated in Russia for a military career, Laidoner earned the rank of lieutenant colonel in Russian service. He served in World War I (1914–18) as an intelligence officer and then as a divisional chief of staff. In 1918 Laidoner became commander in chief of the new Estonian army, which drove the German and Russian occupiers out of Estonia in 1918–19. He left the army in 1920 but returned to it in 1924 to put down an attempted communist coup d’état. In 1925 he headed a League of Nations commission that dealt with a British–Turkish Mosul frontier dispute.
In 1934 Laidoner again led the Estonian army in putting down an attempted government takeover by the right-wing “Vap” movement, and thereafter he headed the military support of President Päts’s authoritarian regime. Laidoner was deported to the Soviet Union when the Soviets occupied Estonia in June 1940, and he died there.
