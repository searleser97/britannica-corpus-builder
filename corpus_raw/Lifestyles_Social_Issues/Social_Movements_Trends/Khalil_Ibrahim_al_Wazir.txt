Khalīl Ibrāhīm al-Wazīr, byname Abū Jihād,  (born October 10, 1935, Ramla, Palestine [now in Israel]—died  April 16, 1988, Tunis, Tunisia), Palestinian leader who became the military strategist and second in command of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).
Wazīr fled from Ramla with his family during the 1948 war that followed the creation of the State of Israel. He grew up in the Gaza Strip, where he was educated by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. He met future PLO leader Yāsir ʿArafāt in 1951 while attending college in Cairo, and together they organized anti-Israel guerrilla actions and founded the militant organization Fatah (1958), which merged with smaller groups to form the PLO (1964). As ʿArafāt’s deputy and a moderate within the PLO, Wazīr often negotiated with PLO extremists, maintained diplomatic relations with other countries, and reportedly planned military strategies and arranged arms purchases for Fatah and the PLO. After the PLO was expelled from Jordan in 1971, he eventually became an advocate of rapprochement with Jordan and played a role in increasing the PLO’s emphasis on work in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. These efforts contributed to a general Palestinian uprising known as the intifāḍah in 1987.  He was killed in his home in Tunis by Israeli commandos.
