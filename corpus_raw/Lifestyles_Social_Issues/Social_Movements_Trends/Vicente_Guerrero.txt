Vicente Guerrero,  (born Aug. 10, 1782, Tixtla, Mex.—died  Feb. 14, 1831, Chilapa), hero of the Mexican efforts to secure independence.
Guerrero began his military career in 1810, and soon the early Mexican independence leader José Maria Morelos commissioned him to promote the revolutionary movement in the highlands of southwestern Mexico. After Morelos’ execution by the Spanish in 1815, Guerrero continued to lead his guerrilla forces against the Spanish until 1821, when he joined forces with Agustín de Iturbide and with him issued the Plan of Iguala, which became the political platform for the conservative wing of the Mexican independence movement. The Mexican forces triumphed over the Spaniards and achieved independence for Mexico in August 1821.
Guerrero continued to participate in the military and political struggles that followed independence, and in March 1829 he attained the presidency of Mexico as the result of a successful liberal revolt against the conservative candidate who had been chosen president in the election of 1828. But the aged Guerrerro proved to be less adept at political administration than at military command, and that same year he was unseated by General Antonio López de Santa Anna, who replaced him in the presidency with Anastasio Bustamante. After leading rebel forces Guerrero was captured, tried, and executed.
