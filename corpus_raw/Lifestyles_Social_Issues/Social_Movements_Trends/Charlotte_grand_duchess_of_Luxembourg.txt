Charlotte, in full Charlotte Aldegonde Élise Marie Wilhelmine,  (born Jan. 23, 1896, Château de Berg, Lux.—died  July 9, 1985, Château de Fischbach), grand duchess of Luxembourg from 1919 to 1964. Her constitutional reign saw the evolution of Luxembourg into a modern social-democratic state.
The second daughter of Grand Duke William IV, Charlotte succeeded her sister Marie-Adélaïde, who abdicated in January 1919 after acquiring a pro-German reputation during World War I. Charlotte immediately called for a referendum, and in September three-quarters of the voters preferred her continued reign to a republic. Six weeks later she married Prince Félix of Bourbon-Parma (d. 1970). They had six children: Jean, Élisabeth, Marie-Adélaïde, Marie-Gabrielle, Charles, and Alix. When Nazi Germany overran Luxembourg in May 1940, Charlotte fled with the government, settling in Montreal for the duration of the war. Her frequent radio messages of encouragement were never forgotten by a grateful people. In April 1961 she granted Prince Jean all of her ducal responsibilities in preparation for abdicating in November 1964.
Charlotte’s popular reign provided stability during a time of sweeping change. Luxembourg’s constitution was twice rewritten (1919 and 1948), providing universal suffrage and abolishing the country’s much-violated disarmed neutrality. Labour laws and social-security schemes were passed, and through the Benelux Economic Union, NATO, and the EEC, Luxembourg was integrated into post-World War II western Europe. During this time Charlotte’s steadfast patriotism and democratic sympathies made her a symbol of Luxembourg’s sovereignty and prosperity.
