William Cushing,  (born March 1, 1732, Scituate, Mass. [U.S.]—died  Sept. 13, 1810, Scituate), American jurist who was the first appointee to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Cushing graduated from Harvard in 1751, began studying law, and was admitted to the bar in 1755. After working as a county official, he succeeded his father in 1772 as judge of the superior court of Massachusetts. With the outbreak of the American Revolution, he sided with the revolutionaries, and in 1777 he became the chief justice of the supreme judicial court of Massachusetts. His most notable act during his 12 years in that post was his 1783 ruling that the “all men are born free and equal” clause in the state bill of rights implicitly abolished slavery in Massachusetts. Cushing was appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court by President George Washington shortly after that court’s formation in September 1789. He declined the chief justiceship in 1796 owing to ill health, but he remained an associate justice on the court until his death in 1810.
