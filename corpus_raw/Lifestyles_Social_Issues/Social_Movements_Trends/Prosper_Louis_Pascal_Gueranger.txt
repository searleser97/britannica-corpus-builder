Prosper-Louis-Pascal Guéranger,  (born April 4, 1805, Sablé-sur-Sarthe, France—died  Jan. 30, 1875, Solesmes), monk who restored Benedictine monasticism in France and pioneered the modern liturgical revival.
Guéranger, ordained a priest in 1827, was an Ultramontanist (pro-papist) who reacted against Gallicanism, a movement advocating the administrative independence of the French hierarchy from papal control. Devoted to the Roman liturgy, he campaigned for the abolition of the various local liturgies then flourishing in France. Subsequently, he was inspired to restore Benedictine monasticism, which had been eradicated by the Revolution. In December 1832 he acquired the monastic buildings and lands of Solesmes, founded in the 11th century.
Despite numerous difficulties, Solesmes by 1837 had become a confirmed abbey with Guéranger installed as abbot and head of the Benedictine Congregation of France. There he aimed to renew the tradition of learning pursued by the Maurists, his scholarly Benedictine predecessors, and to revive a rich liturgical life. The first volume of his Institutions liturgiques—an ambitious, uncompleted project—appeared in 1840; it was effective in restoring the Roman liturgy in France. The second volume (1841) is an important history of the liturgy in France from the 17th to the 19th century; the third volume appeared in 1851. The Institutions was reedited posthumously, and a fourth volume was added (1885), containing several controversial letters written in reply to criticisms of the Institutions.
