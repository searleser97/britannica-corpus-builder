Theódoros Kolokotrónis,  (born April 1770, Messenia [Greece]—died  Feb. 15, 1843, Athens), prominent Greek patriot in the War of Greek Independence (1821–30).
As a member of the Greek revolutionary society Philikí Etaireía, Kolokotrónis led Moreot bands during the War of Independence. His most brilliant action was his part in the defeat of Mahmud Dramali’s Ottoman army in August 1822. He was imprisoned on Hydra for his defiance of the central government but was later released to help defend the Morea (Peloponnese) against the Egyptians. In 1825 he signed the Greek demand for British protection and invited Sir Richard Church to be Greek commander in chief. In 1828 he supported the president, Count I.A. Kapodístrias, and became one of the leaders of the pro-Russian party. After the count’s assassination on Oct. 9, 1831, Kolokotrónis set up a rival administration favouring 17-year-old Prince Otto of Bavaria for the newly created Greek throne, and he later tried to overthrow the young king’s regency, composed largely of Bavarians. For this, Kolokotrónis was condemned to death on June 7, 1834, but was later reprieved.
