Fennoman movement,   in 19th-century Finnish history, nationalist movement that contributed to the development of the Finnish language and literature and achieved for Finnish a position of official equality with Swedish—the language of the dominant minority.
Early Fennomen activities included the establishment of the Saturday Society (1830) and the Finnish Literary Society (1831), both devoted to Finnish language and letters. The publication of Elias Lönnrot’s epic, the Kalevala (1835), and other artistic and scholarly works in Finnish proved to the opposition Svecoman, or Swedish, movement that Finnish could serve as a vehicle for cultural development.
Because the Russian authorities (Finland was then under imperial Russian rule) were generally sympathetic to the Fennoman cause, steady progress was made in the course of the century, especially during the reign of Tsar Alexander II (1855–81). In 1863, at the urging of Johan Vilhelm Snellman, the leading figure of the movement, Alexander II declared Finnish to be an official language of Finland in matters relating to the interests of Finnish-speaking people, and he ordered that it gain governmental and judicial parity with Swedish by 1883. In 1902 a Russian decree declared Finnish to be the official language of all areas where Finnish speakers were in the majority.
In the 1860s a “Finnish party” was formed to advance the Fennoman cause; this organization split over constitutional issues into the Old Finn and Young Finn parties in the 1890s.
