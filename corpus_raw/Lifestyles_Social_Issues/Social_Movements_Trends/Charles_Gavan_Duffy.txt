Sir Charles Gavan Duffy,  (born April 12, 1816, County Monaghan, Ire.—died  Feb. 9, 1903, Nice, Fr.), Irish nationalist who later became an Australian political leader.
While studying law in Dublin, Duffy, along with John Blake Dillon and Thomas Davis, founded the Nation (1842), a weekly journal of Irish nationalist opinion. Later he and his two colleagues formed the “Young Ireland” party, which advocated Irish independence. Duffy was seized just before an abortive attempt at insurrection (August 1848) and imprisoned until 1849. In 1852 he was elected to Parliament for New Ross, County Wexford, and in that body he organized an independent opposition of some 50 Irish members to obstruct any government that did not support the demands of the Irish Tenant League. His tactics foreshadowed those of Charles Stewart Parnell, but Duffy’s efforts were frustrated by factionalism and by lack of support from the Irish clergy, who thought him too radical.
Duffy retired from Irish politics in 1855, and, leaving Ireland, he said, “as a corpse on a dissecting table,” he went to Australia. He practiced law in Melbourne and was elected to the Victoria House of Assembly in 1856. After becoming minister of that state’s land and works (1857), he promoted an important land act. He served as prime minister of Victoria in 1871–72, was knighted in 1873, and was speaker of the Victoria House of Assembly from 1877 to 1880. He thereafter retired to southern France to write his memoirs, which form a principal source for the history of Ireland in the period. His books include The League of North and South, 1850–54 (1886) and My Life in Two Hemispheres (1898).
