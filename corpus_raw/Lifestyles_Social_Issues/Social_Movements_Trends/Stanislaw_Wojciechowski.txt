Stanisław Wojciechowski,   (born March 15, 1869, Kalisz, Pol., Russian Empire—died  April 9, 1953, Golabki, Pol.), one of the leaders in the struggle for Polish independence from Russia in the years before World War I. He later served as the second president of the Polish Republic (1922–26).
While a student at the University of Warsaw, Wojciechowski worked for the Polish Socialist movement, which was a major force in the independence effort. He was arrested in 1891, and upon his release a year later he went to Paris and then to London. In England he helped publish the Polish Socialist periodical Przedświt (“The Dawn”) and became friends with Józef Piłsudski. He also studied the cooperative movement, and on returning to Poland in 1906 he spent his time working to develop Polish cooperatives.
During World War I, because he saw Germany as Poland’s main enemy, Wojciechowski in 1915 went to Moscow, and there in 1917 he was elected president of the Council of Polish Parties’ Union. He returned to Warsaw at the end of the war and from January 1919 to July 1920 served as minister of the interior in three separate cabinets of the new Polish Republic. He was elected to the Sejm (Diet) as a member of the Polish Peasant Party in November 1922. When Gabriel Narutowicz, president of the republic, was assassinated in December 1922, Wojciechowski was chosen to succeed him.
In the new government Wojciechowski and Piłsudski, then military chief of staff, differed as to the direction the nation should take. Wojciechowski supported continued parliamentary government, while Piłsudski favoured a more authoritarian approach. In May 1926, Piłsudski staged a successful coup d’état. Wojciechowski then retired to private life.
