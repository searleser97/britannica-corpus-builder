Jean-Abraham-Daniel Davel,  (born October 1670, Morrens, Switz.—died  April 24, 1723, Vidy), Swiss popular leader, folk hero of the canton of the Vaud, who led the Vaudois separatist movement against the rule of Bern (1723).
Annexed by Bern in 1536, the Vaud had long chafed under the administration of Bernese bailiffs when in 1723 Davel became the focus of discontent. Claiming divine inspiration and envisioning a Christian revival, he led a contingent of followers upon Lausanne, the administrative capital of the Vaud (March 31, 1723), where he urged the declaration of Vaudois independence. The city’s councillors refused compliance with his demands and delivered him to the Bernese authorities.
The movement was crushed and Davel was executed. But his heroic manner on the execution block won him the admiration of many, and he became a continuing symbol of the Vaudois struggle for independence, occupying a significant place in local tradition well into the 20th century.
