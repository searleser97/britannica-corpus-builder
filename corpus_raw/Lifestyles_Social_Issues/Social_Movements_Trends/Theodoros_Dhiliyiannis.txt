Theódoros Dhiliyiánnis, also spelled Deligiánnis or Diliyiánnis,  (born April 1826, Kalávrita, Greece—died  May 13 or June 13, 1905, Athens), politician who was prime minister of Greece five times (1885–86, 1890–92, 1895–97, 1902–03, 1904–05). He was a resolute advocate of aggressive and often irresponsible territorial expansion. His bitter rivalry with the reformist politician Kharílaos Trikoúpis dominated Greek politics for the last quarter of the 19th century.
Dhiliyiánnis, who studied law at the University of Athens, first became prominent as Greece’s foreign minister in 1862. He was ambassador in Paris (1867–68), and in 1877, as foreign minister in the government of Aléxandros Koumoundhoúros, he advocated Greek intervention in the Russo-Turkish War; the following year he was a delegate to the Congress of Berlin, which sought to solve the Eastern Question.
While his rival Trikoúpis advocated constitutional government and internal reform, Dhiliyiánnis, a supporter of the Great Idea (Megáli Idéa) that promised the liberation of all Greeks under Turkish rule and even the recovery of Constantinople (Istanbul), occupied himself primarily with an aggressive foreign policy and organized his followers into the conservative Nationalist Party, in opposition to Trikoúpis’ Liberal Party. In 1885 Dhiliyiánnis formed his first government and, inspired by the Bulgarian declaration of complete independence from Turkey, prepared to invade Turkish Macedonia, an adventure that was stopped only when the great powers blockaded Greek ports.
Dhiliyiánnis became prime minister again in 1890 and 1895. Spurred on by the 1896 revolt on Crete (Modern Greek: Kríti) against Turkish rule, he declared war on Turkey in April 1897, sending a fleet to the island and an army led by Crown Prince Constantine into Macedonia  and Epirus (Íperos). The army was defeated, and Greece was forced to yield 12 strategic points along its northern border to Turkey. Resigning as prime minister, Dhiliyiánnis kept his seat in the Chamber of Deputies, though he had lost much of his popular following. Nevertheless, he was prime minister again in 1902–03 and from December 1904 until his assassination by opponents of his strict measures against gambling syndicates.
