Alexandru Vaida-Voevod,  (born 1872, Olpret, Transylvania, Hungary [now in Romania]—died March 19, 1950, Bucharest, Romania), politician who served three times as prime minister of Romania (1919–20, 1932, 1933) and was a leading spokesman for the union of Transylvania with the Old Kingdom (Moldavia and Walachia).
A native of Hungarian-ruled Transylvania, Vaida-Voevod joined a small Romanian nationalist group in the Hungarian Parliament after 1906, becoming one of the foremost opponents of the governmental policy of forced Magyarization of national minorities. He was a supporter of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and a federalist solution to Austria-Hungary’s nationality problem. In October 1918 he presented a resolution to Parliament announcing Transylvania’s right to self-determination, and in December 1918, following Hungary’s surrender to the Allies in World War I, he won appointment to the Transylvanian directing council, which proclaimed union with Romania. He subsequently joined the Romanian delegation to the post-World War I peace conference at Paris (1919).
Following the successes of his National Party in the elections of November 1919, Vaida-Voevod was named Romanian prime minister in a coalition government. His radical approach to national land reform prompted the intervention of King Ferdinand, who dissolved the administration by fiat (March 1920). From 1928 to 1930 Vaida-Voevod served as minister of the interior in the National Peasant government; and from August to October 1932 he held simultaneously the prime ministry and the ministry of foreign affairs. His final ministry (January–November 1933) was marked by widespread labour unrest and growing fascist activity. After his dismissal from office, he left the National Peasant Party and formed his own nationalist, semifascist group, the Romanian Front (1935). He never regained his earlier political influence.
