Felice Orsini,  (born December 10, 1819, Meldola, Papal States [now in Italy]—died March 13, 1858, Paris, France), Italian nationalist revolutionary and conspirator who tried to assassinate the French emperor Napoleon III.
A follower of the Italian revolutionary leader Giuseppe Mazzini, Orsini participated in the uprisings in Rome in 1848–49, thereafter serving as Mazzini’s agent in Switzerland, Hungary, and England. After a daring escape from an Austrian prison in Mantua in 1855, he went to London and wrote two accounts of his adventures—The Austrian Dungeons in Italy (1856) and Memoirs and Adventures of F. Orsini Written by Himself (1857)—which were extremely popular with the British public. Orsini broke with Mazzini in 1857 and, emotionally disturbed, began to plot the assassination of Napoleon III, impelled by the notion that the emperor’s death would trigger in France a revolution that would spread to Italy. On the night of January 14, 1858, he and two accomplices threw bombs at the carriage of Napoleon and Empress Eugénie as they were going to the opera in Paris; although several persons were killed, the intended victims were unhurt. Orsini was arrested and executed.
Ironically, following Orsini’s attack, Napoleon, remembering the pro-Italian sympathies of his youth, was prompted to declare war on Austria in 1859, from which Italy’s independence followed.
