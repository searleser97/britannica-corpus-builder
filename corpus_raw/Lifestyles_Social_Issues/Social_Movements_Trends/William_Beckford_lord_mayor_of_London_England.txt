William Beckford,  (baptized December 19, 1709, Jamaica, British West Indies—died June 21, 1770, London, England), gentleman merchant, member of Parliament, and lord mayor of London (1762–63, 1769–70) who was particularly noted as a pioneer of the radical movement.
Beckford was reared in Jamaica, first arriving in England (to complete his schooling) at the age of 14. Upon the death of his elder brother Peter, who died unmarried, he inherited the considerable wealth that had accrued from Jamaican sugar plantations over several generations. Elected to Parliament for Shaftesbury in 1747, Beckford became alderman of Billingsgate in 1752 and represented the City of London in Parliament from 1754 until his death. From 1756 he developed a close political connection with William Pitt the Elder, and, through him, important popular city interests, hitherto usually in opposition, were for the first time allied with the government. These interests resented the retirement of Pitt and the terms of the Peace of Paris, and in 1763 Beckford gave strong support to outspoken journalist John Wilkes. In 1761 Beckford had begun criticizing the system of parliamentary representation, and during the crisis of 1769 over Wilkes and the Middlesex election Beckford urged the abolition of pocket boroughs (election districts that were “in the pocket” of one family or person). While Wilkes won popularity for the Wilkite movement, it was Beckford who inspired its leaders and provided a program of reform—shorter Parliaments and a wider franchise.
