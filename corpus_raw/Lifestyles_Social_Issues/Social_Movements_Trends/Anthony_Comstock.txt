Anthony Comstock,  (born March 7, 1844, New Canaan, Conn., U.S.—died  Sept. 21, 1915, New York, N.Y.), one of the most powerful American reformers, who for more than 40 years led a crusade against what he considered obscenity in literature and in other forms of expression. The epithet “comstockery” came to be synonymous with moralistic censorship.
A Union Army veteran of the American Civil War, Comstock began about 1872 to work with the Young Men’s Christian Association in New York City. In 1873 he lobbied successfully for the enactment of a severe federal statute known as the Comstock Law, which outlawed the transportation of obscene matter in the mails. From that year until his death he served (without pay until 1906) as a special agent of the U.S. Post Office Department. Also in 1873 he founded the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice.
Ordinarily, Comstock attacked commercial pornography rather than serious writing, but he sometimes took action against established modern works and the classics on the principle of “morals, not art or literature.” Personally vindictive toward “libertines,” he is said to have boasted of the number of persons he had driven to suicide. More creditable were his efforts to suppress fraudulent banking schemes, mail swindles, and medical quackery.
