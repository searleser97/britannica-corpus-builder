Elizabeth Fry, née Gurney,  (born May 21, 1780, Norwich, Norfolk, Eng.—died  Oct. 12, 1845, Ramsgate, Kent), British Quaker philanthropist and one of the chief promoters of prison reform in Europe. She also helped to improve the British hospital system and the treatment of the insane.
The daughter of a wealthy Quaker banker and merchant, she married (1800) Joseph Fry, a London merchant, and combined her work with the care of a large family. Unwearyingly attending to the poor, she was acknowledged as a “minister” by the Society of Friends (1811) and later traveled in Scotland, northern England, Ireland, and much of Europe. There she inspected prisons and wrote reports. Her recommendations for Newgate Prison, for instance, included separation of the sexes, classification of criminals, female supervision for women, adequate provision for religious and secular instruction, and useful employment. Even in her lifetime her suggestions were increasingly acted upon throughout most of Europe.
