Elman Rogers Service,  (born May 18, 1915, Tecumseh, Mich., U.S.—died  Nov. 14, 1996, Santa Barbara, Calif.), American anthropological theorist of cultural evolution and formulator of the nomenclature now in standard use to categorize primitive societies as bands, tribes, chiefdoms, and states. Although widely accepted, the system was abandoned by Service himself because his subsequent research made him question the accuracy of the terminology, especially in the case of “tribe.” His examination of cultural evolution in Paraguay and his studies of cultures elsewhere in Latin America and the Caribbean led to a series of books on social systems and the rise of the state.
Service enlisted in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade during the Spanish Civil War and in the U.S. Army during World War II. He received a Ph.D. from Columbia University (1950) and was appointed to the anthropology faculty there (1949–53). He also taught at the University of Michigan (1953–69) and the University of California, Santa Barbara (1969–85). He was the author of A Profile of Primitive Culture (1958; rev. ed. published as Profiles in Ethnology, 1963) and coeditor, with Marshall D. Sahlins, of Evolution and Culture (1960). Other works include Primitive Social Organization (1962), The Hunters (1966), Cultural Evolutionism (1971), Origins of the State and Civilization (1975), and A Century of Controversy: Ethnological Issues from 1860 to 1960 (1985).
