Chitta Ranjan Das,  (born Nov. 5, 1870, Calcutta [now Kolkata], India—died June 16, 1925, Darjeeling [now Darjiling]), politician and leader of the Swaraj (Independence) Party in Bengal under British rule.
After failing the competitive entrance examination for the British-dominated Indian Civil Service, Das entered the legal profession. He defended many accused of political offenses and took an active part in nationalistic journalism.
Bitterly opposing British rule in India and rejecting all ideas of political or economic development of India along Western lines, he idealized the life of the ancient Indian village and saw a golden age in ancient Indian history. He supported the noncooperation movement launched against British rule by Mahatma Gandhi and in 1921 was imprisoned for six months as a political offender. In 1922 he became president of the Indian National Congress. Under his leadership the Congress abandoned its intentions to boycott colonially sponsored elections for provincial councils. It decided instead to participate in order to seek positions that would permit them to obstruct governmental business from within.
Later, when the Swarajists were returned as the largest party in Bengal, Das declined the post of chief minister, stating that his aim was to wreck the existing government, not to cooperate with it. In 1924 he was elected mayor of Calcutta (now Kolkata) and tried to improve the lot of the city’s neglected Indian population. In 1925 there were some signs of a possible compromise between Das and Lord Birkenhead, the secretary of state for India, but Das died before any agreement could be reached.
