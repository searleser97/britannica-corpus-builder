Albanian League, in full League for the Defense of the Rights of the Albanian Nation, also called League of Prizren,  first Albanian nationalist organization. Formed at Prizren (now in Kosovo) on July 1, 1878, the league, initially supported by the Ottoman Turks, tried to influence the Congress of Berlin, which was formulating a peace settlement following the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78 and which threatened to partition Albania (then part of the Ottoman Empire) and transfer some of its districts to Montenegro, Serbia, and Greece. Unsuccessful in its appeals to the congress, the league used military force to prevent Montenegro from annexing the northern Albanian districts assigned to it (February 1879 and April 1880); the league also forced the area acquired by Greece to be reduced (1881).
The league, however, was compelled to give up the district of Ulcinj (Dulcigno) to Montenegro (November 1880) and then was crushed by a Turkish army (by May 1881) that had been sent into Albania when the sultan’s government became annoyed with the league’s demands for political autonomy. Despite its defeat, the league engaged in activities between 1878 and 1881 that not only demonstrated the existence of a genuine nationalist movement in Albania but also gave impetus to that movement, which in 1912 brought about the declaration of the independence of Albania.
