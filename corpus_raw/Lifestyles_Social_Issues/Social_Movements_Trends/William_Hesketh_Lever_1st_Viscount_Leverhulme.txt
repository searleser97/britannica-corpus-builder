William Hesketh Lever, 1st Viscount Leverhulme,  (born Sept. 19, 1851, Bolton, Lancashire, Eng.—died  May 7, 1925, Hampstead, London), British soap and detergent entrepreneur who built the international firm of Lever Brothers.
Lever entered the soap business in 1885, when he leased a small, unprofitable soapworks. With his brother, James Darcy Lever, he began to make soap from vegetable oils instead of tallow and registered the name “Sunlight” for the product. At Port Sunlight in 1888 their company financed a model industrial village; and the brothers soon instituted other employee benefits, including pensions, medical care, unemployment compensation, profit sharing, and free insurance. By 1925 the firm served a world market through a system of 250 associated companies.
William Lever, elected to Parliament in 1906, was raised to the peerage as a baron in 1917 and became a viscount in 1922. “Leverhulme” was a combination of his own name and his wife’s maiden name, Hulme.
