Gongsun Hong, Wade-Giles romanization Kung-sun Hung,  (born 200 bc, Zichuan [now in Shandong province], China—died 121 bc, Chang’an [now Xi’an, Shaanxi province]), scholar who helped establish Confucianism as the official doctrine of the Chinese state.
According to tradition, Gongsun Hong was a poor swineherd who did not begin the study of the Confucian Classics until he was 40 years old. In 140 bc he placed first among scholars examined by the Han emperor Wudi and became one of his most important advisers. Primarily known for his ability to interpret portents and omens, Gongsun Hong made an understanding of omens part of the officially accepted Confucian doctrine; future generations of administrative officials used his interpretations of natural phenomena in their attempt to check Imperial policies with which they disagreed.
In 124 bc Gongsun Hong, together with the scholar Dong Zhongshu, established the first Imperial university. This school, which trained and tested future officials in the Confucian doctrines, became the predecessor of the later Confucian civil service examination system.
