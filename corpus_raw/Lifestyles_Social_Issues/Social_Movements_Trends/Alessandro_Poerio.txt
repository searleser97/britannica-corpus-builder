Alessandro Poerio,  (born August 27, 1802, Naples [Italy]â€”died November 3, 1848, Venice), Italian liberal during the Risorgimento, brother of Carlo Poerio.
The son of Baron Giuseppe Poerio, a Neapolitan lawyer well known for his own liberal sympathies, Alessandro was taken into exile by his father on the Bourbon restoration in Naples in 1815. He returned to Naples in 1818 and was able, in 1821, to enlist as a volunteer in the army; he fought against the Austrians at Rieti. After the Austrian victory he again went with his family into exile and traveled in Germany, where he became the friend of Goethe. He began to write poetry, which was highly esteemed though its bulk was small because of his perfectionism. His writings had great inspirational importance during the Risorgimento. When the family was again allowed to come back to Naples (1833), Alessandro came with them. In 1848 he again volunteered to fight the Austrians and died in Venice of wounds received at Mestre.
