Agis IV,   (born c. 263 bc—died  241), Spartan king (244–241) who failed in his attempt to reform Sparta’s economic and political structure.
Agis succeeded his father, Eudamidas II, at the age of 19. Drawing upon the tradition of the Spartan lawgiver Lycurgus, Agis sought to reform a system that distributed the land and wealth unequally and burdened the poor with debt. He proposed the cancellation of debts and the division of the Spartan homeland into 4,500 lots for citizens. By this time the number of full citizens had dwindled to 700. Full citizenship was to be extended to many perioeci (voteless freemen) and foreigners, and 15,000 lots were to be distributed to the remaining perioeci. In addition to pursuing these reforms, Agis sought the restoration of the Lycurgan system of military training.
Agis was supported by his wealthy mother and grandmother, who surrendered their property; by his uncle Agesilaus; and by Lysander, who was an ephor (magistrate with the duty of limiting the power of the king) in 243. When the rich, led by the other king, Leonidas II, defeated these proposals, Leonidas was deposed. The ephors of 242 tried to restore him to his throne, but they were replaced by a board headed by Agesilaus.
Agis then began to carry out the cancellation of debts while delaying the redistribution of land. He was called away from Sparta (241) when Aratus of Sicyon, temporarily Sparta’s ally, requested aid in one of his wars. Upon his return, Agis found his supporters discontented with Agesilaus’ rule and disillusioned by the delay of the reforms. Leonidas had regained power, supported by mercenaries. Rather than engage in war with Leonidas, Agis took sanctuary but was enticed out, summarily tried, and executed along with his mother and grandmother.
