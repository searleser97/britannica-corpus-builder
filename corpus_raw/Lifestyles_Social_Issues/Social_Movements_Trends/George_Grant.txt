George Grant, in full George Parkin Grant,  (born November 13, 1918, Toronto, Ontario, Canada—died September 27, 1988, Halifax, Nova Scotia), Canadian philosopher who achieved national renown with his pessimistic 97-page book, Lament for a Nation: The Defeat of Canadian Nationalism (1965).
Grant was educated at Queen’s University, Kingston, Ontario, and in England at the University of Oxford, where he was a Rhodes scholar. He taught philosophy at Dalhousie University, Halifax (1947–60), before becoming chairman of the department of religion at McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario (1961–80). In Lament for a Nation, he decried the decision made by Liberal Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson to allow cruise missile testing over Canada. Grant later cautioned about the “dictatorship of technology” and warned that Canadian nationalism could become endangered through the adoption of U.S. business goals. In 1980 he returned to Dalhousie University as a professor of political science and classics. Some of his other influential works include Technology and Empire: Perspectives on North America (1969), English-Speaking Justice (1974), and Technology and Justice (1986).
