Max Wladimir, Freiherr von Beck,  (born September 6, 1854, Vienna, Austrian Empire [now Austria]—died January 20, 1943, Vienna), premier (1906–08) of Austria whose administration introduced universal male suffrage to the Austrian half of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy.
Rising quickly in Austrian government service after 1876, Beck served after 1880 in the Ministry of Agriculture, becoming director of legislative and organizational affairs (1888) and departmental chief (1900). He was also adviser to the heir apparent, Archduke Franz Ferdinand. He was named premier for Austria (1906) amid controversy over impending suffrage legislation and a tariff crisis with Hungary. His draft bill of December 1906, establishing universal male suffrage and proportional representation of nationalities in the Reichsrat (legislature), became law in 1907.
During Beck’s administration, new programs of social insurance were implemented and two railways were nationalized. His opposition to the Austro-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia cost him the support of Franz Ferdinand, who favoured annexation and who resented that Beck had taken office as prime minister under the emperor Franz Joseph. On November 15, 1908, Beck was forced to resign. Beck is considered to have been one of the ablest Austrian premiers of the late monarchy.
