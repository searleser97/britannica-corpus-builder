26th of July Movement, Spanish Movimiento 26 de Julio,  revolutionary movement led by Fidel Castro that overthrew the regime of Fulgencio Batista in Cuba (1959). Its name commemorates an attack on the Santiago de Cuba army barracks on July 26, 1953. The movement began formally in 1955 when Castro went to Mexico to form a disciplined guerrilla force. The leaders of the movement remaining in Cuba to carry out sabotage and political activities were Frank País, Armando Hart, and Enrique Oltuski. At this time the movement espoused a reform program that included distribution of land to peasants, nationalization of public services, industrialization, honest elections, and mass education.
In early 1957, with Castro back in Cuba fighting in the Sierra Maestra, “Civic Resistance” groups were organized in the cities, and numerous middle-class and professional persons gravitated toward Castro. In 1958 the movement joined in a “Junta of Unity” with most other groups opposing Batista. After Castro’s victory, the 26th of July Movement was integrated into the Organizaciones Revolucionarias Integradas in 1961.
