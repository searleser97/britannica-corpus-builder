Johan Vilhelm Snellman,  (born May 12, 1806, Stockholm, Swed.—died  July 4, 1881, Kirkkonummi, Fin.), Finnish nationalist philosopher and statesman who was an important figure in the movement to establish Finnish as a national language.
In 1835, when Snellman became a philosophy instructor at the University of Helsinki, Finland was a grand duchy of Russia (1809–1917) and Swedish was the language of cultivated people. That same year the Finnish national epic, the Kalevala, was published, thus initiating interest in establishing a national literature in Finnish. From the 1840s Snellman led the movement for the adoption of Finnish as the mother tongue and insisted that Finnish be allowed in government offices and schools.
In 1842 he published Läran om staten (“Political Science”), which was influenced deeply by the philosophy of G.W.F. Hegel and in which he advanced the idea that the essence of a state is a national spirit. His influence as a stimulator of the national cultural life began in 1844 with the publication in Finnish of his Maamiehen ystävä (“Farmer’s Friend”) and a Swedish-language newspaper that was suppressed in 1846. Later, with Elias Lönnrot, the scholar and folklorist who compiled the Kalevala, he edited the Litteraturblad för allmän medborgerlig bildning (“Literary News for General Civic Culture”). He was appointed a professor at the University of Helsinki in 1856 and from 1863 to 1868 served as a senator. Snellman exerted a decisive influence on the promulgation of the 1863 statute extending the use of Finnish. He also helped to change the Finnish monetary standard from rubles to marks (1865). His Kootut teokset (“Collected Works”) appeared in 1928–33.
