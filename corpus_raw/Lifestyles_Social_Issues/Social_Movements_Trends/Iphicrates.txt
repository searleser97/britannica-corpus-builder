Iphicrates,   (born c. 418 bc—died c. 353), Athenian general known chiefly for his use of lightly armed troops (peltasts); he increased the length of their weapons and improved their mobility by reducing defensive armour.
Iphicrates used his peltasts skillfully in the Corinthian War (395–387), nearly annihilating a battalion of Spartan hoplites near Corinth in 390. After the war he served the Persians as a mercenary commander, then returned to Athens. His expedition (373) to relieve Corcyra of a Spartan siege was successful, but he failed in attempts to recover Amphipolis (367–364).
Retiring to Thrace, Iphicrates fought for the Thracian king Cotys against Athens. The Athenians soon pardoned him and made him a commander in their struggle against their rebelling allies (Social War, 357–355). Iphicrates and two of his colleagues were prosecuted by Chares, the fourth commander, after they had refused to give battle during a violent storm. Iphicrates was probably acquitted but he died soon afterward.
