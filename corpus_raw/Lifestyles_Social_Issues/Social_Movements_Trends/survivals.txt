Survivals,  in anthropology, cultural phenomena that outlive the set of conditions under which they developed.
The term was first employed by the British anthropologist Edward Burnett Tylor in his Primitive Culture (1871). Tylor believed that seemingly irrational customs and beliefs, such as peasant superstitions, were vestiges of earlier rational practices. He distinguished between continuing customs that maintained their function or meaning and those that had both lost their utility and were poorly integrated with the rest of culture. The latter he termed survivals. Tylor later expanded the notion of survivals to include material culture. Among other examples he invoked men’s formal wear, specifically the styling of the tailcoat, as an example in which vestiges of a past item—in this case the greatcoat, with its waist-length front and split tail for ease in riding horses—had survived into the present.
The Scottish evolutionist John Fergusson McLennan used the term to denote symbolic forms of earlier customs. For instance, mock battles in nuptial rituals were said to be survivals of an earlier stage, when marriage putatively involved the capture or kidnapping of women.
Other writers emphasized concrete functionality rather than symbolic meaning: they held that an item or behaviour could change in function and thereby remain integrated with the rest of culture. The strongest adherent to this view, Polish-British anthropologist Bronisław Malinowski, entirely rejected the suggestion that any part of culture could have no function or could be disconnected from the rest of the cultural system.
The term survivals continues to be used in discussions of cultural change, cultural stability, and the reconstruction of historical sequences.
