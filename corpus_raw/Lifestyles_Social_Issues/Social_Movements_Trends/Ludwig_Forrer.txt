Ludwig Forrer,  (born Feb. 9, 1845, Islikon, Switz.—died  Sept. 28, 1921, Bern), Swiss statesman, twice elected federal president, who was a noted proponent of Swiss legal reform.
A leader of Zürich radicalism and a lawyer of national prominence, Forrer served between 1873 and 1900 on the federal Nationalrat (national assembly), where he continually pressed for standardization of the legal code. In 1888 he presented a motion for penal law reform, and between 1891 and 1893 he worked on the draft of an industrial insurance law that was rejected.
Following the defeat of this proposal (1900), Forrer retired briefly from political life but was elected to the Bundesrat (federal council) in 1902 and later served twice (1906, 1912) as president of the confederation. As head of the department of posts and railways (1907), he completed the nationalization of the famous Gotthard line and worked toward the electrification of the federal railway service.
