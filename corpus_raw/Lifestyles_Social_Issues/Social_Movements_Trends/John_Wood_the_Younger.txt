John Wood the Younger ,  (born Feb. 25, 1728, Bath, Somerset, Eng.—died  June 18, 1782, Batheaston, Somerset), British architect whose work at Bath represents the culmination of the Palladian tradition initiated there by his father, John Wood the Elder. Bath is one of the most celebrated achievements in comprehensive town design.
The younger Wood apparently served as assistant to his father, being entrusted with completion of the elder Wood’s design for the Exchange, Liverpool (1748–55). Upon his father’s death in 1754, Wood became Bath’s principal architect. He completed the work on the Circus, after his father’s design, and planned the Royal Crescent (1767–75), the latter being an enormous ellipse of 30 attached townhouses facing a broad park. The unified facade of the imposing structure conveys a palatial effect; it was the first such design in English town architecture and was widely imitated. A well-known individual structure by Wood at Bath is the Assembly Rooms (1769–71), with great two-story interiors containing screens of columns.
