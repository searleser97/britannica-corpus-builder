Robert Neelly Bellah,  (born February 23, 1927, Altus, Oklahoma, U.S.—died July 30, 2013, Oakland, California), American sociologist who addressed the problem of change in modern religious practice and who offered innovative procedures for reconciling traditional religious societies with social change.
Bellah was educated at Harvard University, where he received his B.A. (1950) and Ph.D. (1955), and taught at the Institute for Islamic Studies at McGill University (1955–57) and the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Harvard (1957–58). After studying in Japan on a Fulbright scholarship (1960–61), Bellah returned to Harvard (1961–66). In 1967 he became Ford Professor of Psychology at the University of California at Berkeley, a position he held until his retirement in 1997, when he was appointed Elliott Professor of Sociology Emeritus.
His influential work Beyond Belief: Essays on Religion in a Post-Traditional World (1970) applies economic theory to culture. Varieties of Civil Religion (1980) expresses Bellah’s belief that the “civil” religion inherent in educational and legal systems should be encouraged because of its openness and tolerance. The popular book Habits of the Heart (1985; with others) describes relationships between religion and American culture.
In 2000 Bellah was awarded the National Humanities Medal by U.S. Pres. Bill Clinton. In 2006 he published The Robert Bellah Reader, a collection of previous works.
