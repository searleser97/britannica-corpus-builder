Boris Nikolayevich Chicherin,  (born May 26 [June 7, New Style], 1828, Tambov, Russia—died  Feb. 3 [Feb. 16], 1904, Karaul, Tambov province), liberal Russian historian and philosopher who argued vigorously for social change. Although widely regarded as a brilliant scholar, Chicherin’s advocacy of the peaceful legislative reform of tsarist autocratic rule blighted his public career and led to his neglect by Soviet historiographers.
Born into the gentry, Chicherin early embraced a Western outlook, devoting himself to the study of Hegelian philosophy. His historical studies led him to advocate in 1857 a three-point reform program for Russia: emancipation of the serfs, freedom of conscience, and freedom of speech and the press. He viewed the reform of the established order through legal processes as the principal means of implementing these ideas, and eventually he came to advocate a constitutional monarchy. He was a lifelong opponent of socialism and violent or revolutionary change.
Frequently at odds with the authorities and with other Russian intellectuals, Chicherin was appointed a professor of law at the University of Moscow in 1861, but he resigned in 1868 as a protest against government interference in a tenure case. He was elected mayor of Moscow in 1881 but was forced to resign in 1883 because of his publicly expressed preference for popular government in Russia. He spent the remainder of his life in scholarly pursuits. His works include The History of Political Doctrines (1877), The Foundations of Logic and Metaphysics (1894), and The Philosophy of Law (1900).
