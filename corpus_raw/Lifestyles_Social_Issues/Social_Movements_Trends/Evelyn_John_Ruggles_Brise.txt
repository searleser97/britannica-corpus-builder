Sir Evelyn Ruggles-Brise,  (born Dec. 6, 1857, Finchingfield, Essex, Eng.—died Aug. 18, 1935, Peaslake, Surrey), prison reformer who was instrumental in the founding and development of England’s Borstal system for the treatment of young offenders.
Appointed prison commissioner in 1895 (a position he held until 1921), he had the duty of applying the recommendations of the Gladstone Committee. The committee held that offenders between 16 and 21 years of age should not be subjected to the harsh punitive treatment that was administered to older, less tractable prisoners and should be given education and industrial training at a penal reformatory under the supervision of a qualified staff.
Ruggles-Brise visited the United States in 1897 to study the state reformatory system; upon his return to England he collected a group of young prisoners at the prison in Borstal, Kent, and in 1902 began to implement the program of reform. In 1908 Parliament established the system that permitted magistrates to prescribe “Borstal detention” as a separate sentence for young offenders. Ruggles-Brise was made a knight commander of the Bath in 1902. He published Prison Reform at Home and Abroad (1924), which gave his views of the penal systems of various countries.
