ʿIsām Sartāwī, also spelled Issam Sartawi,  (born 1935, Acre, Palestine [now ʿAkko, Israel]—died April 10, 1983, Albufeira, Portugal), Palestinian nationalist who, as one of the moderate leaders in the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), attracted much hostility from Palestinian extremists because he advocated coexistence with Israel.
Trained as a medical doctor in Baghdad, Iraq, Sartāwī was conducting research in the United States as a heart surgeon at the time of the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. He returned to the Middle East to join Fatah, the guerrilla wing of the PLO, and accepted its view that the Palestine problem could be solved only through armed struggle. He founded the Arab Command for the Liberation of Palestine, a military group that disbanded in the mid-1970s. Sartāwī then became a close adviser to Yāsir ʿArafāt. Later, however, Sartāwī’s views began to change, and he pursued a dialogue with moderate Israelis in the hope of achieving a reconciliation between the two peoples. There was little sympathy within the PLO for his views, however, and official Israeli policy also was uncompromising. In April 1983 he attended a meeting of the Socialist International in Portugal and was killed in the lobby of the hotel where the conference was being held. An organization that had previously split from the PLO, the Abū Niḍāl group, was widely suspected of the killing.
