Hampton Court Conference,   meeting held at Hampton Court Palace, near London, in January 1604, in response to the Millenary Petition (q.v.), in which the Puritans set forth their demands for reform of the Church of England. The conference was presided over by King James I and attended by the bishops and the Puritan leaders. Among the reforms discussed were changes in church government, changes in The Book of Common Prayer, and a new translation of the Bible.
James rejected most of the Puritans’ demands and was firm in his rejection of any change in the episcopal form of church government. When confronted with the issue, he said that he had learned in Scotland “No bishop, no king.” He accepted the Puritans’ request for a new translation of the Bible, which led to the one important result of the conference, the preparation of the Authorized (King James) Version of the Bible (1611).
