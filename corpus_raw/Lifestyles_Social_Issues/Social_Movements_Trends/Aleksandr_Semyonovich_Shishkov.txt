Aleksandr Semyonovich Shishkov,  (born March 20 [March 9, old style], 1754—died  April 21 [April 9, O.S.], 1841, St. Petersburg, Russia), Russian writer and statesman whose intense nationalistic and religious sentiments made him a precursor of the Slavophile movement in Russia of the 1830s and 1840s.
A naval officer by training, Shishkov rose to the rank of vice admiral before retiring in disagreement with the early liberal reforms of Alexander I. Devoting himself to the promotion of Russian patriotism, he became a self-styled philologist, insisting that the Russian language be purged of foreign, especially French, influence. To this end, he founded a literary society, Beseda Lyubitelyey Russkogo Slova (Gathering of Lovers of the Russian Word), and wrote Discourse on Love for One’s Country (1811).
Alexander I, impressed by the discourse and faced with invasion by Napoleon, made Shishkov secretary of state. He was nominated president of the Russian Academy in 1813, made a member of the State Council in 1814, and became minister of education and director of non-Orthodox religious affairs in 1824. In these positions he opposed mass education, instituted strict censorship, and persecuted the biblical societies for distributing revolutionary books.
