Hannah Johnston Bailey, née Hannah Clark Johnston,  (born July 5, 1839, Cornwall-on-the-Hudson, New York, U.S.—died October 23, 1923, Portland, Maine), American reformer who was a leading advocate of the peace movement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
In 1868 she was married to Moses Bailey, a Maine manufacturer, who died in 1882. In 1883 Bailey joined the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union. From 1887 to 1916 she headed its International Department of Peace and Arbitration; she published two widely circulated monthly periodicals, the Pacific Banner and the Acorn, and also distributed hundreds of thousands of pacifist leaflets.
Bailey traveled widely throughout the United States to promote pacifism, temperance, and women’s suffrage. In 1892 she met with Pres. Benjamin Harrison to present a popular protest against military involvement in Chile. Bailey also crusaded against lynching, and she opposed military conscription, military drills, and military toys.
