 Encyclopædia Britannica’s first biography of Nelson Mandela appeared in 1965, published in the Britannica Book of the Year prepared by Britannica’s London office:
That Book of the Year, which described the events of 1964, also noted Mandela’s sentencing in its article on South Africa:
In 1965 Britannica’s offices in London and in Chicago prepared separate Book of the Year products. The American edition did not include a biography of Mandela, although it reported his sentencing in its article on Africa:
In its article on South Africa, it used much the same language as the edition prepared in London but with some factual and stylistic variations:
The first biography of Mandela in the Encyclopædia Britannica print encyclopaedia appeared in 1985, as part of a major revision of the encyclopaedia’s 15th edition. Although a typo marred its rendering of Mandela’s name, it significantly extended the Book of the Year’s treatment in 1965:
A year later, in the Britannica Book of Year that summarized the events of 1985, another biography of Mandela appeared, written by Colin Legum, a correspondent for The Observer newspaper. It appeared between biographies of David Mamet and Carmelo Mifsud Bonnici:
In 1990—a year that the Britannica Book of the Year called “a momentous one for South Africa”—Mandela was released from prison and became deputy president of the ANC. Another biography of Mandela by Legum appeared in the Book of the Year published in 1991:
In 1993 Mandela and de Klerk were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace, an occasion that spurred another brief profile of Mandela in the Book of the Year published in 1994. That same year Mandela became the first black president of South Africa, a position in which he was succeeded by Thabo Mbeki in 1999. Five years later, in 2004, “former president Nelson Mandela officially retired from public life,” as longtime Britannica contributor Martin Legassick noted in the Book of the Year published in 2005.
By the time of the retirement of the print version of the Encyclopædia Britannica, in 2012, its biography of Mandela had expanded considerably since 1985 and was accompanied by a 1990 photo of Mandela:
Details about Winnie Mandela’s life that had appeared in previous biographies of Nelson Mandela were included in the print Encyclopædia Britannica’s biography of her, which immediately followed his.
Since 1998 the electronic version of Britannica’s biography of Nelson Mandela has been revised more than a dozen times, and today that biography differs considerably from the one that appears in the last printing of the Encyclopædia Britannica.
