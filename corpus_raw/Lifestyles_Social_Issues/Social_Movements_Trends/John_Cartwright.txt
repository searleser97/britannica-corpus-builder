John Cartwright, byname Major Cartwright,  (born Sept. 17, 1740, Marnham, Nottinghamshire, Eng.—died  Sept. 23, 1824, London), advocate of radical reform of the British Parliament and of various constitutional changes that were later incorporated into the People’s Charter (1838), the basic document of the working class movement known as Chartism. His younger brother Edmund was the inventor of the power loom.
John Cartwright joined the Royal Navy about 1758, fought in the Seven Years’ War (1756–63), and was promoted to first lieutenant in 1766. In ill health, he retired from the Navy shortly before the revolt (1775) of the North American colonies; he was one of England’s earliest supporters of the colonists and in 1774 had published his first plea on behalf of the colonists, entitled American Independence the Glory and Interest of Great Britain. In 1775, when the Nottinghamshire Militia was first raised, he was appointed major, and in this capacity he served for 17 years. He was at last superseded because of his celebration of the French Revolution. In 1776 appeared his first work on reform in Parliament, entitled, Take Your Choice—a second edition appearing in 1777 under the new title of The Legislative Rights of the Commonalty Vindicated. The task of his life was thenceforth chiefly the attainment of universal suffrage and annual Parliaments. In 1778 he conceived the project of a political association, which took shape in 1780 as the Society for Constitutional Information. From this society sprang the more famous Corresponding Society. Major Cartwright was one of the witnesses at the high treason trial of his friends Horne Tooke, John Thelwall, and Thomas Hardy in 1794 and was himself indicted for conspiracy in 1819 and condemned to pay a fine of £100.
