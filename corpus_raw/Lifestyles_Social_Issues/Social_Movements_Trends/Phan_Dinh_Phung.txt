Phan Dinh Phung,  (born 1847, Ha Tinh province, Vietnam—died  Dec. 28, 1895, Nghe Tinh province), Vietnamese government official who opposed French expansion in Vietnam and became a leader of the nationalist resistance movement.
Phan was a mandarin at the court of the Vietnamese emperor Tu Duc. After Tu Duc’s death in 1883, Phan opposed the succession of the emperor’s nephew Ham Nghi. Ham Nghi ascended the throne in 1884, however, and Phan was condemned to death by his enemies at the court; the sentence was later commuted to banishment. Ham Nghi became the youthful figurehead leader of an unsuccessful rebellion against the French in 1885.
By 1894 Phan led another rebellion that failed because of inadequate support. Phan and his fellow revolutionaries were forced to retreat to the mountains of Nghe Tinh province. In July 1895 the French sent 3,000 troops to Nghe Tinh, but Phan’s resistance movement held out for several months. At the end of the year, Phan died of dysentery, and the remainder of his followers were caught and executed.
