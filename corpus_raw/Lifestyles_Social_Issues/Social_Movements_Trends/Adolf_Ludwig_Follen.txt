Adolf Ludwig Follen, also called August Adolf Follenius,  (born Jan. 21, 1794, Giessen, Hesse—died  Dec. 26, 1855, Bern), German political and Romantic poet, an important founder and leader of radical student groups in the early 19th century.
While studying at Giessen in 1814, he founded the democratic Deutsche Lesegesellschaft (German Reading Society). Expelled for his political views in 1815, he went to Heidelberg, where he was among the founders of the political student association Teutonia. With his brother, Karl, he was also the leader of the Unbedingten (Uncompromising Ones), or Schwarzen (Blacks), a radical student group whose ideas resulted in the assassination of the conservative dramatist August Kotzebue in 1819. Based on an idealized picture of the medieval Christian empire, Follen’s political ideas were aimed at incorporating the German states into a national, united, Christian republic. He expressed these goals in his collection of songs, Freye Stimmen frischer Jugend (1819; “Free Voices of Fresh Youth”).
Banished after a political trial, Follen moved to Switzerland, where he taught at Aarau (1821–27) and published Harfen-Grüsse aus Deutschland und der Schweiz (1823; “Harp Greetings from Germany and Switzerland”). Follen also wrote non-political poetry, inspired, like his political ideas, by a Romantic enthusiasm for the Middle Ages. This sentiment is evident in his ballads on events in Swiss history, in his novel Malagys und Vivian (1829), and in Siegfrieds-Tod (1840; “Siegfried’s Death”), a ballad of part of the Nibelungenlied. His last important work was the epic poem Tristans Eltern (1857; “Tristan’s Parents”).
