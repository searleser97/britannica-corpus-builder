Fayṣal ibn ʿAbd al-Qādir al-Ḥusaynī, Ḥusaynī also spelled Husseini,  (born July 17, 1940, Baghdad, Iraq—died May 31, 2001, Kuwait City, Kuwait), Palestinian political leader who, as the most senior Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) official in Jerusalem, was a pragmatic but persistent spokesman for Palestinian claims in east Jerusalem.
Al-Ḥusaynī came from a prominent Palestinian family. His father was a military hero who died fighting Zionist forces outside Jerusalem in 1948, and a more distant relative, Amīn al-Ḥusaynī, had been the grand mufti of Jerusalem (1921–48). Al-Ḥusaynī studied science in Egypt and military tactics in Syria. Politically active from an early age, he joined Yāsir ʿArafāt’s Fatah movement in 1961 and the PLO in 1965. When most PLO leaders left Palestine, al-Ḥusaynī remained in Jerusalem. He was repeatedly arrested by Israeli authorities and learned Hebrew while in prison. In later years he joined other moderates, both Israeli and Arab, in support of U.S.-mediated peace negotiations, and he was often invited to represent the Palestinian point of view on Israeli radio and television. Al-Ḥusaynī’s home, Orient House, served as the unofficial PLO headquarters in east Jerusalem and also came to house the Arab Studies Center, an organization he helped found in 1979 that conducted research on issues pertaining to Palestinians. Al-Ḥusaynī died of a heart attack while on a PLO peace mission to Kuwait.
