Nikolay Alekseyevich Milyutin,  (born June 6 [June 18, New Style], 1818, Moscow, Russia—died  Jan. 26 [Feb. 7], 1872, Moscow), Russian statesman who played a prominent role in the emancipation of the serfs in Russia.
Educated at Moscow University, Milyutin entered the Ministry of the Interior at the age of 17 and advanced rapidly in the service. In the early 1840s he was responsible for the reform of the municipal governments of St. Petersburg, Moscow, and Odessa. Appointed assistant minister of the interior in 1859, Milyutin took a leading part in the framing of the Emancipation Manifesto of March 3, 1861, from which he and his progressive associates succeeded in eliminating some of the more objectionable features advocated by the ultraconservative groups. He was forced to retire in April 1861, but, after the Polish insurrection of 1863, he was appointed secretary of state for the Russian part of Poland, where in 1864 he carried out the emancipation of the peasantry at the expense of the Polish landowners, whom he considered to be the core of Polish nationalism. Milyutin also removed all Roman Catholic priests and monks from Poland’s schools with a similar intent. He suffered a stroke in 1866 and lived in retirement thereafter.
