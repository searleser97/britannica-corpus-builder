Giovanni Lanza,  (born Feb. 15, 1810, Casale Monferrato, Piedmont, French empire [now in Italy]—died  March 9, 1882, Rome, Italy), Italian statesman and political activist of the Risorgimento who was premier in 1870 when Rome became the capital of a united Italy and who helped organize the political forces of the centre-left.
After graduating from the University of Turin as a doctor of medicine, Lanza concentrated on agricultural improvement in Piedmont. In 1848 he enlisted as a volunteer in a Piedmontese force sent to help the Lombards against the Austrians. Elected a deputy of the Piedmontese Chamber, he opposed the peace treaty (Aug. 9, 1849) with Austria and became one of the most effective leaders of the centre-left. He became vice president of the Chamber in 1853, and, as minister of education from May 1855, he instituted many important reforms. Later (January 1858) he was named Piedmontese minister of the interior. In March 1861 he presided over the parliament that proclaimed Victor Emmanuel II king of all Italy. After further service as minister of the interior (1864–65) and again as president of the Italian Chamber, he formed his own cabinet on Dec. 14, 1869, and achieved the final step in the unification of Italy by taking possession of Rome (Sept. 20, 1870). His fairness and impartiality won him the deep respect of the Italian people.
