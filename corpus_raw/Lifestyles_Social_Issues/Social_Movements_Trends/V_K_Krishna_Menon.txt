V.K. Krishna Menon, in full Vengalil Krishnan Krishna Menon,  (born May 3, 1897, Calicut [now Kozhikode], India—died Oct. 6, 1974, New Delhi), Indian nationalist and champion of India’s anticolonialism and neutralism.
After studying at the London School of Economics, Menon was called to the bar at the Middle Temple. He became an ardent socialist and served as a Labour member of the St. Pancras Borough Council from 1934 to 1947. His primary political interest in England centred on the struggle for freedom in India, however, and he strove tirelessly in this cause as secretary of the India League from 1929. His long and close relationship with Jawaharlal Nehru, nationalist and first prime minister of independent India, began during that period.
With the coming of Indian independence in 1947, Krishna Menon was appointed high commissioner (ambassador) of India in London. He returned to India in 1952 after 27 years of residence in England, becoming a member of the Indian Parliament in 1953, minister without portfolio in 1956, and minister for defense in 1957. From 1952 to 1960 he represented India in the General Assembly of the United Nations, where his vigorous presentation of anticolonial and neutralist policies of his government won him many admirers.
As minister of defense, he brought new vigour to his office and introduced many far-reaching changes, but his policies and methods received heavy criticism, and the military reverses suffered by India at the hands of the Chinese in the Himalayas in 1962 were attributed by some to his policies. Overwhelming opposition forced him to relinquish the Ministry of Defense in October 1962. Thereafter he devoted himself to left-wing political activity as an independent.
