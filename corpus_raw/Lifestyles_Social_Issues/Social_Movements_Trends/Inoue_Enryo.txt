Inoue Enryō,   (born March 18, 1858, Echigo Province, Japan—died  June 6, 1919, Dairen, Manchuria), Japanese philosopher and educator who attempted to reinterpret Buddhist concepts so they would be relevant to Western philosophical doctrines. An ardent nationalist, Inoue helped make Buddhism an intellectually acceptable alternative to Western religious doctrines.
After attending the school for priests at the Higashihongan-ji, the main temple of the Jōdo-Shinshū (True Pure Land sect) in Japan, Inoue enrolled in Tokyo Imperial University, where he graduated from the department of philosophy in 1885. Critical of what he considered the excessive Westernization of Japan, especially the conversion of many governmental leaders to Christianity, he founded (1887) the Tetsugaku kan (Philosophical Institute) to promote the study of Buddhism. Inoue’s belief that Buddhism epitomized Oriental philosophy gained many adherents, and with their aid he began to publish the highly nationalistic magazine Nihonjin (“The Japanese”) and embarked on a series of lecture tours throughout Japan and Europe.
In his later life, Inoue conducted an educational campaign to overcome superstitions inspired by folklore interpretations of Japanese mythology. For this purpose he established the Ghost Lore Institute in Tokyo and gained the sobriquet “Doctor Obake,” or “Doctor Ghost.” He died while on a speaking tour in Manchuria.
