Flemish movement,   the 19th- and 20th-century nationalist movement of Flemish-speaking people in Belgium. It has sought political and cultural equality with, or separation from, the less numerous but long-dominant French-speaking Walloons. The movement had its origins in the 1830s; at first, under the leadership of the philologist Jan Frans Willems, it concentrated on the revival of the Flemish literary language. By the 1850s the movement put forth such political demands as separate Flemish and Walloon army units, introduction of Flemish in the administration and courts, and Flemish language instruction in schools and at the University of Ghent.
In the last decades of the century, the movement gained strength by its alliance with the Catholic Peopleâ€™s Party. The Flemish literary language was already well developed by this time. Flemish was introduced into the administration and courts of the Flemish areas, and in 1898 it became the second official language of the country. In 1930, after a long struggle, Flemish became the sole language of instruction at the University of Ghent. In 1932 separate Flemish army units and a Flemish military academy were instituted. In the same year Flemish became the language of instruction in all primary and secondary schools in Flemish areas.
In the second half of the 20th century, as demographic predominance and political control shifted to the Flemings, the movement continued to press for further gains.
