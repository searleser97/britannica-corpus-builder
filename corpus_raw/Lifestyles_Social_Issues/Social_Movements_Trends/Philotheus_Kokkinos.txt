Philotheus Kokkinos,   (born c. 1300, Salonika, Greece—died  1379, Constantinople [now Istanbul, Tur.]), theologian, monk, and patriarch of Constantinople, a leader of the Byzantine monastic and religious revival in the 14th century. His numerous theological, liturgical, and canonical works received wide circulation not only in Byzantium but throughout the Slavic Orthodox world.
Born of a Jewish mother, Philotheus became a monk and then abbot of the Great Laura on Mount Athos, Greece, where he was an advocate of Hesychasm (a form of contemplative prayer) and a close friend of the theologian Gregory Palamas. In 1347 Philotheus was named bishop of Heraclea, near Constantinople, but spent most of his time at the imperial capital.
A protégé of the emperor John VI Cantacuzenus, Philotheus was appointed patriarch of Constantinople in November 1353. He was deposed by John V Palaeologus in 1354 and then restored by Callistus I. After he was reappointed patriarch in 1364, Philotheus opposed the efforts of John V to negotiate with the popes Urban V and Gregory XI. Asserting his patriarchal authority, he fostered the Hesychast cause by canonizing Gregory Palamas and acclaiming him a doctor of the Greek Orthodox Church at the synod of 1368.
Through an independent ecclesiastical policy, moreover, Philotheus consolidated the Orthodox Serbs, Bulgarians, and Russians with the Greek patriarchate. Concomitantly, he implemented his theory of Constantinople’s patriarchal supremacy over the entire Eastern church. In 1367 he agreed to hold a Union Council with the Western church, but the idea was rejected by Pope Urban VI. Philotheus actively intervened in the political and ecclesiastical affairs of Russia, consolidating administrative functions under a single metropolitan of Kiev and all Russia (who actually resided in Moscow).
