Godfrey Wilson,  (born 1908—died  May 19, 1944), British anthropologist and analyst of social change in Africa.
In 1938 Wilson was appointed the first director of the Rhodes-Livingstone Institute in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia). The institute was the first local anthropological research facility to be set up in an African colony. Wilson and his wife, Monica Hunter Wilson, worked as a team in their examination of social conditions resulting from the rapid economic, political, and cultural change in the British colonies of Tanganyika, Nyasaland, and Northern Rhodesia. Their book, The Analysis of Social Change (1945), is based on this experience.
Wilson studied anthropology at the London School of Economics and Political Science under Bronisław Malinowski. He directed the Rhodes–Livingstone Institute until 1942, when he joined the staff of the South African Medical Corps. His work was particularly influenced by his interest in the effects of industrialization on primitive peoples.
