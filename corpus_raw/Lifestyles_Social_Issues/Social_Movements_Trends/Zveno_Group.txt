Zveno Group,  small political organization that briefly formed a dictatorial regime in Bulgaria (1934–35); the name Zveno refers to a link in a chain. Founded in 1930, the Zveno Group was led by Col. Kimon Georgiev and was composed primarily of radical civilians, who had become disillusioned with a government hampered by military domination, irresponsible political parties, and uncontrolled terrorist activities. When an associate of the Zveno Group, Col. Damian Velchev, staged a coup d’état (May 19, 1934), Georgiev became prime minister of Bulgaria.
The Zveno government, advised by Velchev, assumed a dictatorial character, dissolved Parliament, and abolished all political parties. It imposed strict censorship on newspapers, prohibited trade unions, and reorganized the educational system to stimulate the training of more technicians and scientists and to discourage the formation of a large intelligentsia. It advocated an atheistic regime—fashioned mostly after the ideas of Benito Mussolini—based on “social solidarity” and the abolition of democratic institutions. Shortly after taking office, Georgiev suppressed the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization, established friendlier relations with Yugoslavia, and resumed diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. In addition, his government reduced the peasants’ debts, reformed the nation’s credit system, and encouraged the extension of professional medical care into rural areas.
King Boris III, whose influence had been reduced to a minimum, took advantage of rumours that the group intended to form a republic, gathered support among military officers (who initially had supported the Zveno government), and deposed Georgiev and his government (Jan. 22, 1935).
