Edward A. Filene, in full Edward Albert Filene,  (born September 3, 1860, Salem, Massachusetts, U.S.—died September 26, 1937, Paris, France), American department-store entrepreneur, philanthropist, and social reformer.
His father, William Filene (originally Filehne), emigrated from Prussia to the United States in 1848, opened (and closed) a series of stores in Massachusetts and New York, and finally, in 1881, set up a retail “specialty store” in Boston. In 1891 the prosperous department store was turned over to his sons, Edward and Lincoln, and then renamed William Filene’s Sons Company. Edward Filene became president and was in charge of overall company policy and merchandising. His most famous and profitable innovation was the Automatic Bargain Basement, to which slow-selling goods were relegated after they had failed to sell upstairs in a designated period of time. In 1928, in an internal power struggle, he lost all control of Filene’s, retaining only the titular role of president.
From the beginning of the century, Filene, a lifelong Democrat, took an active interest in public affairs, promoting various causes during the Progressive era and the New Deal. He pioneered the formation of credit unions as democratic loan institutions; he organized the Cooperative League (1919), which later became the Twentieth Century Fund, a fact-finding research organization and agency for socioeconomic reform; and he organized the Consumer Distribution Corporation (1935), designed to encourage consumer cooperatives. He helped to found the Chamber of Commerce of the United States in 1912 but broke with the national organization in 1936, claiming that it was a tool of unenlightened businessmen. Filene was a coinventor of the Filene-Finlay simultaneous translator that was later used for the Nürnberg war crime trials and for sessions of the United Nations.
