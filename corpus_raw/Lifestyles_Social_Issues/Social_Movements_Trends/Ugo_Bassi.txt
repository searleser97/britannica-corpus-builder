Ugo Bassi,  (born Aug. 12, 1801, Cento, Cisalpine Republic [Italy]—died  Aug. 8, 1849, Bologna), Italian priest and patriot, who was a follower of Giuseppe Garibaldi in his fight for Italian independence.
Educated at Bologna, he became a novice in the Barnabite order at age 18, and, after studying in Rome, he entered the ministry in 1833. He gained fame as a preacher with eloquent and genuinely enthusiastic sermons that attracted large crowds. Living chiefly at Bologna, he traveled all over Italy aiding and tending the poor.
At the outbreak of the revolutionary movements in 1848, when Pope Pius IX still appeared to be a liberal and a nationalist, Bassi joined, as an army chaplain, General Giovanni Durando’s papal force protecting the frontiers. His eloquence helped draw new recruits into the republican movement, and he exercised great influence over the soldiers and the people generally. When Pius discarded all connection with the nationalist movement, only Bassi was able to restrain the Bolognese in their indignation. He was wounded at Treviso in May 1848 but, on his recovery, marched unarmed at the head of the volunteers at Mestre.
After the pope’s flight from Rome in November and the proclamation of the Roman republic in early 1849, Bassi joined the forces of Garibaldi, fighting against French troops that were sent in to restore the temporal power. When Garibaldi was forced to leave Rome, Bassi followed him to San Marino; when the legion broke up, Garibaldi escaped but Bassi and a fellow patriot, Count Livraghi, were captured near Comacchio. Turned over to the Austrian authorities and taken to Bologna, they were charged with having been found with guns in their hands (Bassi had never borne arms) and were executed.
