Tjipto Mangunkusumo,  (born 1884â€”died  March 8, 1942, Djakarta, Java, Dutch East Indies [now Indonesia]), early 20th-century Indonesian nationalist leader whose resistance to Dutch colonial rule brought him exile and long imprisonment.
Tjipto Mangunkusumo was among the first Indonesian leaders to abandon the cultural approach of most early nationalist groups, which promoted distinctly Indonesian art, literature, and values. With E.F.E. Douwes Dekker and Suwardi Surjaningrat (later known as Ki Hadjar Dewantoro) he founded in 1911 the socialist Indies Party (Indische Partij), which was devoted to political action to attain independence. Two years later all three leaders were ordered out of the Dutch East Indies, although Tjipto Mangunkusumo was allowed to return in 1914. He resumed activity in Insulinde, the successor to the Indies Party, backing radical action such as the peasant resistance to taxes in the Solo princely lands. In 1918 he became a member of the Volksraad, a parliamentary body that included Indonesians but exercised very little power. In July 1927 he helped found the Indonesian Nationalist Party (Partai Nasional Indonesia), of which Sukarno was chairman. Shortly thereafter, however, Tjipto Mangunkusumo was sent into exile on a prison island for attempting to foment revolt among the Indonesians serving in the Dutch forces. He remained in exile for 11 years.
