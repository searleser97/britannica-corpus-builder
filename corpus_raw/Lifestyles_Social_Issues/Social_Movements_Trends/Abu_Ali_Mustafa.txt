Abū ʿAlī Muṣṭafā, byname of Muṣṭafā al-Zibrī,  (born 1938, ʿArrābah, Palestine [West Bank]—died August 27, 2001, Ramallah, West Bank), Palestinian nationalist who was a cofounder (1967) and secretary-general (2000–01) of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), a radical faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).
Born Muṣṭafā al-Zibrī, he later took the nom de guerre Abū ʿAlī Muṣṭafā. As a young man he joined George Habash’s Arab National Movement, and in 1967 he and Habash formed the Marxist-oriented PFLP, based in Damascus, Syria. The PFLP, which staunchly rejected PLO peace talks with Israel, was widely accused of orchestrating terrorist attacks and hijackings. However, Muṣṭafā eventually acknowledged the legitimacy of the Palestinian Authority, an entity produced by Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, and in September 1999 he unexpectedly returned to the West Bank. After Habash’s retirement in 2000, Muṣṭafā became head of the PFLP. The following year he was killed in an Israeli rocket attack on his office.
