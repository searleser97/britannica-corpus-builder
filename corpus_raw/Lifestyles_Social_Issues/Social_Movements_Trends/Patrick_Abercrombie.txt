Sir Patrick Abercrombie, in full Sir Leslie Patrick Abercrombie,  (born June 6, 1879, Ashton upon Mersey, Cheshire [now in Greater Manchester], Eng.—died  March 23, 1957, Aston Tirrold, Berkshire), British architect and town planner who redesigned London after it was devastated by enemy bombardment in World War II.
The son of a Manchester stockbroker, Abercrombie was one of nine children; his younger brother Lascelles became a noted poet and critic. He was educated at Uppingham School and apprenticed to architects in Manchester and Liverpool for six years before joining (1907) the staff of the University of Liverpool, where he later became a professor of civic design (1915–35). Early in his career, Abercrombie earned notice as the first editor of Town Planning Review and cowinner (with Sydney and Arthur Kelly) of an international competition to redesign Dublin (1916). During his tenure at Liverpool, he cofounded the Council for the Preservation of Rural England (1926) and drafted schemes for the English towns and regions of Sheffield, Doncaster, Bristol, and Bath, among others.
While a professor of town planning at University College in London (1935–46), Abercrombie devised postwar reconstruction plans for London and its environs. With the County of London Plan (1943; coauthored by John Henry Forshaw) and the Greater London Plan (1944), he sought to combat urban sprawl by resettling the population into a number of distinct, self-sufficient communities connected by an improved network of roads. He also contributed to the redevelopment of other war-torn English towns, including Plymouth, Hull, and Bournemouth, and cities outside England like Edinburgh, Hong Kong, and Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Abercrombie was knighted in 1945.
