Arnold Toynbee,  (born August 23, 1852, London, England—died March 9, 1883, Wimbledon), English economist and social reformer noted for his public service activities on behalf of the working class.
Toynbee, the son of a surgeon, graduated from Balliol College, Oxford, in 1878. He was then appointed a tutor at Balliol, where his lectures on the economic history of the Industrial Revolution in Britain proved widely influential. The collection of his lectures, published posthumously as The Industrial Revolution in 1884, was one of the first economic histories of Britain’s industrial development in the 18th and 19th centuries.
Toynbee was also a practical social reformer. He encouraged the development of trade unions and lectured to working-class audiences in large industrial cities. His interest in and desire to help Britain’s growing numbers of poor led him into a close association with the poor working-class district of Whitechapel in East London, and his attempts to establish housing and libraries there were commemorated after his death by Toynbee Hall, a pioneering social settlement in East London. Toynbee died after suffering a complete breakdown in health owing to overwork.
