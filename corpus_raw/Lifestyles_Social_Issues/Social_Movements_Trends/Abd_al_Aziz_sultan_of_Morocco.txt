Abd al-Aziz, Arabic in full ʿabd Al-ʿazīz Ibn Al-ḥasan Ibn Muḥammad Al-ḥasanī Al-ʿalawī,  (born Feb. 24, 1878, or Feb. 18, 1881—died  June 10, 1943, Tangier, Mor.), sultan of Morocco from 1894 to 1908, whose reign was marked by an unsuccessful attempt to introduce European administrative methods in an atmosphere of increasing foreign influence.
Abd al-Aziz was proclaimed sultan upon the death of his father, Hassan I, but did not begin direct rule until after the death in 1900 of his grand vizier, Ba Ahmed (Ahmad ibn Musa). Upon his actual accession, Abd al-Aziz sought European advice in an attempt to modernize the country and in particular to reform the methods of taxation. These endeavours, defeated because of the complete lack of administrators trained in modern practices, caused great resentment among influential notables of the old school. Rival European interests in North Africa complicated the issue, and in 1907 Abd al-Aziz’ brother, Abd al-Hafid (Moulay Hafid), fomented a rebellion in Marrakech. He defeated Abd al-Aziz in battle on Aug. 19, 1908. Two days later the sultan abdicated. Pensioned by his brother, he spent the rest of his life at Tangier. The Franco-Spanish occupation of Morocco followed his abdication by four years.
