Lionel Charles Robbins, Baron Robbins,  (born November 22, 1898, Sipson, Middlesex, England—died May 15, 1984, London), economist and leading figure in British higher education.
Robbins was educated at the University of London and the London School of Economics (LSE). After periods of teaching at New College, Oxford, and LSE, he was appointed professor of economics at the latter university in 1929, a position he held until 1961. Robbins was influenced early in his career by Friedrich Hayek, whom he brought to LSE.
From the first he proved himself an agile theorist—at a time when it was still possible to be an economic theorist without extensive mathematical training. His Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science (1932) has become a methodological classic. In it, he argued that economics is an aspect of all human behaviour because it is based on scarcity: wants are unlimited relative to the means of achieving them. His definition of economics as “that science that studies the relationship between ends and means that have alternative uses” is still widely used. Robbins also argued that the most important propositions and laws in economics are logically derived from basic and obvious assumptions. His work in the history of economic thought is represented in particular by Theory of Economic Policy (1952) and his study Robert Torrens and the Evolution of Classical Economics (1958).
During the 1930s Robbins chaired the LSE economic theory seminars that were notable for influencing young economists of the period. Robbins was made a life peer of the school in 1959. Later he served as chairman of the Financial Times (1961–70) and was also chairman of the Committee on Higher Education (1961–64), a group responsible for the major expansion and reform of British university education in the 1960s.
