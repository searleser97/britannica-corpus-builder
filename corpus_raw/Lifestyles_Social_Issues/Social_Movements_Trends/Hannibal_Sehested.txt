Hannibal Sehested,   (born 1609, Ösel, Swedish Estonia [now Saaremaa, Estonia]—died  Sept. 23, 1666, Paris), statesman who achieved partial autonomy for Norway under Denmark and who laid the basis for the modernization of Denmark’s administrative system.
After foreign travels in 1629–32, Sehested was attached to the court of King Christian IV of Denmark and Norway. He was given charge of the unsuccessful 1635 negotiations with Sweden. He became a member of the Rigsråd (Council of the Realm) in 1640 and was named stadholder (governor) of Norway in 1642, the year of his marriage to Christian IV’s sister Christiane.
In Christian IV’s second war with Sweden (1643–45), Sehested invaded Sweden several times and ably defended Norway from Swedish attack. He steadily improved Norway’s resources and capacity for self-government, and in 1646–47 he won for Norway partial control of its finances, the revenues being used for military expenses and war debts.
Accused by his Rigsråd rivals of embezzlement after the king’s death in 1648, Sehested was forced to surrender his estates to the crown. He retired from the council in 1651 and lived abroad in 1651–58. His offers of service were spurned by Frederick III at the start of a new war with Sweden (1657–60), and Sehested then went to Sweden, in an action approaching treason. Later he was allowed to return to Denmark and negotiate the Treaty of Copenhagen with the Swedes (1660), a treaty that was advantageous to Denmark.
Back in royal favour, Sehested became lord high treasurer and again a state councillor. He dramatically modernized Denmark’s state administration, establishing, for example, colleges for the various branches of government.
