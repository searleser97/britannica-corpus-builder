Georgi Sava Rakovski,  (born 1821, Kotel, Rumelia—died  Oct. 20, 1867, Bucharest), revolutionary leader and writer, an early and influential partisan of Bulgarian liberation from Ottoman Turkish rule.
Already a national revolutionary by the age of 16, he participated in an insurrection against the Turks in 1841. Later, as an employee of the Turkish war ministry during the Crimean War (1853–56), he secretly organized an armed revolt in Bulgaria. Arrested and sentenced to death, he escaped abroad to Serbia, Romania, and Russia, where he sought European support for Bulgarian liberation and published journals. He addressed his revolutionary appeals to his Bulgarian countrymen. Though his radical, violent schemes cost him conservative support, his leadership gave the first real impetus to the Bulgarian independence movement, and his journalistic and literary work especially won young Bulgarians to the national cause. His diplomatic efforts made the Bulgarian problem better known in the European capitals. He organized a “Bulgarian Legion” of volunteers in Belgrade and later in Bucharest that was intended to form the core of a future Bulgarian army. The legion supported the Serbs against the Ottoman Empire in the skirmishes of 1862.
