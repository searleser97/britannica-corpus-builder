Alzina Parsons Stevens, néeAlzina Ann Parsons,  (born May 27, 1849, Parsonsfield, Maine, U.S.—died  June 3, 1900, Chicago), American labour leader and journalist known for her contributions to union organization and child-welfare reform.
Parsons was forced by family poverty to work in a textile factory at 13; by the age of 18, she had learned the printers’ trade. In 1877 she organized the Working Woman’s Union No. 1 in Chicago. Moving to Toledo, Ohio, in about 1882, she began working with the Knights of Labor, organizing a women’s assembly and becoming, by 1890, the chief officer of 22 local Knights’ assemblies.
Stevens returned to Chicago in 1892, and in 1893 she was named assistant factory inspector for the state of Illinois. Her work contributed to the passage of improved child-labour and compulsory school attendance laws in the state. Stevens subsequently lobbied for the passage of a state juvenile-court law that, when enacted in 1899, was the first such law in the nation.
