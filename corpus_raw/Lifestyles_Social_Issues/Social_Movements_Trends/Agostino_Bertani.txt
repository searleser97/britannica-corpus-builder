Agostino Bertani,  (born Oct. 19, 1812, Milan—died  April 10, 1886, Rome), physician who collaborated with Mazzini and Garibaldi in the movement for Italian liberation.
Bertani took part in the March insurrection in Milan in 1848, organized an ambulance service for the republicans during their defense of Rome in 1849, and distinguished himself by his service in Genoa with Mazzini during the cholera epidemic of 1854. He was a surgeon in Garibaldi’s corps in the Austro-Sardinian War of 1859. In 1860 he was one of the strategists of the attack on Sicily and Naples known as the March of the Thousand. He became Garibaldi’s secretary general after the occupation of Naples (September 1860), in which office he reorganized the police and planned the suppression of the religious orders and the sanitary reconstruction of the city. In 1862 he treated Garibaldi’s wounds received at Aspromonte. In the war against Austria (1866), he organized the medical service for Garibaldi’s 40,000, and in 1867, during Garibaldi’s march on Rome, he fought in the Battle of Mentana although he was opposed to the campaign.
Entering the new Italian Parliament in 1861, Bertani became the leader of the chamber’s extreme left. In 1866 he founded La Riforma, a journal advocating social reforms. When the left came to power in 1876 with Premier Agostino Depretis, who introduced a system known as transformism in which he built up his following by taking ministers from both right and left, Bertani, hostile to the system, remained in opposition.
