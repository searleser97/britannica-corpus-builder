Andres Bonifacio,  (born Nov. 30, 1863, Manila—died  May 10, 1897, Mt. Buntis, Phil.), Philippine patriot, founder and leader of the nationalist Katipunan society, who instigated the revolt of August 1896 against the Spanish.
Bonifacio was born of poor parents in Manila and had little formal education, working as a messenger and warehouse keeper before becoming involved in revolutionary activity. He was, however, well-read. Unlike the nationalist poet and novelist José Rizal, who wanted to reform Spanish rule in the Philippines, Bonifacio advocated complete independence from Spain. In 1892 he founded the Katipunan in Manila, modelling its organization and ceremony on that of the Masonic order. The Katipunan at first grew slowly, but by 1896 it had an estimated 100,000 members and branches not only in Manila but also in central Luzon and on the islands of Panay, Mindoro, and Mindanao. Its members were mostly workers and peasants; the urban middle class supported reform rather than revolution.
In August 1896 Bonifacio led the long-planned insurrection on Luzon; but his forces were defeated by Spanish troops, and he was forced to retreat to Montalban in the north, while Emilio Aguinaldo, one of his lieutenants, carried on resistance. As the Spanish systematically routed the insurrectos, it became increasingly clear that Bonifacio was an ineffective military leader. In March 1897 a convention at Tejeros named Aguinaldo, rather than Bonifacio, president of a new Philippine republic. Refusing to recognize the convention, Bonifacio tried to establish his own rebel government. In April 1897 Aguinaldo had Bonifacio arrested and tried for treason; he was executed by a firing squad.
