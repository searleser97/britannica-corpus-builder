Joaquim José da Silva Xavier, byname Tiradentes (Portuguese: “Tooth-puller”),  (born 1748, near São João del Rei, Minas Gerais, Brazil—died  April 21, 1792, Rio de Janeiro), Brazilian patriot and revolutionary who organized and led the first major outbreak against Portuguese rule in Brazil. Unsuccessful, he was tried and executed. The nobleness of Silva Xavier’s defense has made him a Brazilian national hero, and he is viewed as one of the precursors of independence in Latin America.
Educated by his priest brother, Silva Xavier early became a voracious reader. Working as a physician, a merchant, a soldier, and a dentist (hence his nickname Tiradentes), he read widely in the French Philosophes and carried with him copies of the constitutions of the 13 original states of the United States. Sharing his ideas with other intellectuals in the captaincy of Minas Gerais, he advocated complete independence from Portugal. An attempt by Portuguese officials to collect back taxes touched off the call for the rebellion, called the Inconfidência Mineira, led by Tiradentes.
The uprising was a disaster, and Tiradentes was captured in Rio de Janeiro in April 1789. In a trial that lasted two years, he defended the republican cause with great dignity and force. He was the only conspirator to be sentenced to death; he was publicly hanged and then cut into pieces as an example to his fellow revolutionaries.
