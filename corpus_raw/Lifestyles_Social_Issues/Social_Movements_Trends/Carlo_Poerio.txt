Carlo Poerio,  (born Oct. 13, 1803, Naples—died  April 28, 1867, Florence), Italian revolutionary, distinguished for his services to liberalism during the Risorgimento.
The son of the Neapolitan lawyer and liberal Baron Giuseppe Poerio and the brother of the poet and soldier Alessandro Poerio, Carlo shared in the exiles of his family from Naples by the Bourbons; and, when he returned to Naples in 1833, he was an object of constant suspicion, though he was careful to play no part in politics. He was arrested in 1837, 1844, and 1847. In the Revolution of 1848 he helped to formulate the demands of the constitutionalists and then became at first director of police and afterward minister of education in the Liberal government. After his resignation in May 1848 he led the constitutional opposition. He was again arrested in July 1849 but was not tried until February 1851, when he was sentenced with his fellow Liberals to 24 years in irons. The illegality of the trials, the atrocious sentences, and the sufferings of the prisoners horrified the visiting English politician William Ewart Gladstone, who denounced the conditions of the Neapolitan prisons in his two Letters to Lord Aberdeen (July 1851) and so made Poerio’s case notorious throughout Europe. Poerio was not released until January 1859 and then made his way to London.
After the outbreak of war between Sardinia–Piedmont and Austria, he went to Turin. He served as a deputy in the Parliament of the new Kingdom of Italy (1861) but later refused a governmental portfolio.
