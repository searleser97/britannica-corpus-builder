Mukhtar Ahmad Ansari,  (born December 25, 1880, Ghazipur, India—died May 10, 1936, New Delhi), Indian physician and nationalist who was a member of the Foundation Committee of Jamia Millia Islamia, a prominent Islamic university established in 1920 in Delhi. The institution’s formation, in which Ansari was heavily involved, was based on nationalist rejection of British colonial rule.
Ansari studied medicine at Madras Medical College before receiving a scholarship to study in England. While in that country, Ansari supposedly met several members of the Indian National Congress, a major political force in the movement for Indian independence from Great Britain. Following his return to India in 1910, he set up a medical practice in Delhi. Drawn to the national movement, he joined the Congress and the Muslim League. He later served as president for both (Muslim League, 1918–1920; Indian National Congress, 1927).
Ansari was increasingly conscious of the need for quality educational institutions in India. In 1928 he became chancellor of Jamia Millia Islamia, a title he held until his death.
