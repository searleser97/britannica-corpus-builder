John Wood the Elder, byname Wood of Bath,  (baptized Aug. 26, 1704, Bath, Somerset, Eng.—died May 23, 1754, Bath), English architect and town planner who established the physical character of the resort city of Bath. Wood the Elder transformed Bath by adapting the town layout to a sort of Roman plan, emphasizing the processional aspect of social life during the period. Though some of his individual buildings were noteworthy exercises in Palladianism (a kind of 16th-century Italian Renaissance classicism), he was most highly regarded for his planning of streets and groups of houses as visual units.
After helping to build the Cavendish-Harley housing estate in London, Wood designed his first important “townscapes” in Bath, the North and South Parades (1728). These were followed by Queen Square (1735), Prior Park (1735–48), the Royal Mineral Water Hospital (1738), the Circus (completed in 1764, after his death, by his son John Wood the Younger), and the Royal Crescent (1767–75; executed by the younger Wood from his father’s design). Later a school, Prior Park was originally the residence of Ralph Allen, Wood’s chief patron and the principal supplier of Bath building stone (an oolitic limestone).
Wood’s major works outside Bath were the exchanges in Bristol (1740–43) and Liverpool (1748–55; with his son). His Description of the Exchange at Bristol (1745) was reprinted in 1969. Among his other projects were the Bath-Bristol Canal and the Llandaff Cathedral (restoration, from 1735; now incorporated into the city of Cardiff).
In the 1730s and ’40s, Wood developed a unique theory of architecture, and his later projects were influenced by his belief that the Druids had created a great civilization centred on Bath and that their architecture reflected divine laws of proportion and symbolism. His design for the Circus (see above) was based on this theory. Wood’s writings The Origin of Building; or, The Plagiarism of the Heathens Detected (1741, reprinted 1968) and An Essay Towards a Description of the City of Bath (1742–43; 2nd ed. 1749), although they do not explicitly set out the theory, express his thinking at that time.
