Alfred Hermann Fried,  (born November 11, 1864, Vienna, Austria—died May 5, 1921, Vienna), Austrian pacifist and publicist who was a cofounder of the German peace movement and cowinner (with Tobias Asser) of the Nobel Prize for Peace in 1911.
In 1891 Fried, in Berlin, founded the pacifist periodical Die Waffen nieder! (“Lay Down Your Arms!”), from 1899 called Friedenswarte (“The Peacekeeper”). In 1892 he founded the Deutsche Friedensgesellschaft (German Peace Society), which became the focus for the German pacifist movement before World War I. Fried advocated “fundamental pacifism” and believed that “international anarchy” should be met by both legislative measures and spiritual regeneration.
With the outbreak of World War I, he immigrated to Switzerland in protest against German policy. As editor of Blätter für internationale Verständigung und zwischenstaatliche Organisation (“Papers for International Understanding and Inter-State Organization”), he worked for an immediate peace. Fried protested against the Treaty of Versailles but warned the Germans against attempting to revise it by force. His works included Handbuch der Friedensbewegung, 2 vol. (1911–13; “Handbook of the Peace Movement”), and Mein Kriegtagebuch, 4 vol. (1918–20; “My War Diary”).
