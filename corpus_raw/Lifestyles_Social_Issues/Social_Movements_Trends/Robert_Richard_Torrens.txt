Sir Robert Richard Torrens,  (born 1814, Cork, County Cork, Ireland—died  August 31, 1884, Falmouth, Cornwall, England), Australian statesman who introduced a simplified system of transferring land, known as the Torrens Title system, which has been widely adopted throughout the world.
The son of Colonel Robert Torrens (1780–1864), one of the founders of South Australia, Torrens emigrated to that colony in 1839. He served in the South Australian Legislative Council (1851–55), and, when self-government was introduced (1856), he was elected to the Assembly for Adelaide. After a brief term as premier in 1857, he passed his land-transfer bill through the new Parliament. The bill provided for certification of land transfer by a single registration of title, replacing the old, complicated system of tracing deeds. He implemented his system in South Australia, explained it in other parts of the country, and wrote several books on the subject. He returned to England in 1863, serving in Parliament from 1868 to 1874. He was knighted in 1872.
