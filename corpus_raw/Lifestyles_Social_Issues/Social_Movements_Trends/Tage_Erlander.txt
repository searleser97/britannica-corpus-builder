Tage Erlander, in full Tage Fritiof Erlander,  (born June 13, 1901, Ransäter, Sweden—died June 21, 1985, Huddinge, near Stockholm), politician and prime minister of Sweden (1946–69). His tenure as prime minister coincided with the years when the Swedish welfare state was most successful and the so-called “Swedish Model” attracted international attention.
Erlander, son of a schoolteacher, graduated from the University of Lund in 1928 and was an editor for the encyclopaedia Svensk Uppslabok from 1928 to 1938. He entered the Riksdag (parliament) as a Social Democrat in 1933. He became prime minister and chairman of the Social Democratic Party following the death of Per Albin Hansson in 1946 and remained in both posts until October 1969. In the 1968 election, Erlander’s last as prime minister, the Social Democrats garnered more than 50 percent of the votes, which can be interpreted as proof of both the strength of the Social Democratic Party and the great confidence that Swedes had in Erlander.
Over the course of Erlander’s long tenure, Sweden increased its social-welfare legislation with the passage of greater old-age benefits, child allowances, and rent subsidies. His educational reforms included extending compulsory education to nine years and increasing higher-educational opportunities.
After his retirement Erlander wrote four volumes of memoirs, Tage Erlander (1972–76).
