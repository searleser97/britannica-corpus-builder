Young Ottomans, Turkish Yeni Osmanlilar,  secret Turkish nationalist organization formed in Istanbul in June 1865. A forerunner of other Turkish nationalist groups (see Young Turks), the Young Ottomans favoured converting the Turkish-dominated multinational Ottoman Empire into a more purely Turkish state and called for the creation of a constitutional government. By 1867 the Young Ottomans had expanded from the original 6 members to 245, including the noted poets Namık Kemal and Ziya Paşa; they were further supported financially and materially by the Egyptian prince Mustafa Fazıl and had attracted the attention of the Ottoman princes Murad and Abdülhamid.
Exiled for revolutionary activities by the grand vizier Âli Paşa in 1867, the society established itself in Paris; there it made European contacts and began publishing Hürriyet (“Freedom”), an inflammatory newspaper, subsequently smuggled into Turkey, calling on the Turkish people to demand a constitution. The return to Istanbul of Mustafa Fazıl and Namık Kemal weakened the Young Ottomans, and in 1871–72, during the amnesty declared after the death of Âli Paşa, most of them returned to Turkey. The movement, however, had lost its impetus and, except for the isolated activity of such individuals as Namık Kemal, ceased to be a factor in national affairs.
