Annie LePorte Diggs, née Annie LePorte,  (born Feb. 22, 1848, London, Ont., Can.—died Sept. 7, 1916, Detroit, Mich., U.S.),  Canadian-born American reformer and politician, an organizer and campaigner in the Populist Movement of the late 19th century.
Annie LePorte moved with her family to New Jersey in 1855. In 1873, after completing school, she went to Kansas, where in September of that year she married Alvin S. Diggs. In the late 1870s she became interested in the temperance crusade. In 1881 she helped form the nonpolitical Kansas Liberal Union among radical and free thinkers of various stripes. A few months later, during a visit to Boston, she was elected a vice president of the Free Religious Association, succeeding Lucretia Mott.
During 1882 Diggs and her husband published the short-lived Kansas Liberal from their home. Diggs worked for woman suffrage throughout the 1880s and also was active in the developing agitation for cooperative association among farmers and workers. She wrote a column on Farmers’ Alliance news for the Lawrence Journal for a time and then became an associate editor of the Alliance Advocate. She played a central role in transforming the Kansas Farmers’ Alliance into a political body, the People’s (later Populist) Party, and became one of its most effective speakers and organizers. She was a principal figure in Populist election campaigns in Kansas in 1894 and 1896. In these campaigns she was associated with Mary E. Lease, whom she generally disliked and distrusted. In May 1897 she was elected president of the Kansas Woman’s Free Silver League, and as part of the silver movement’s takeover of the Populist Party, Diggs helped effect the Populist-Democrat fusion ticket for the 1898 election. From 1898 to 1902 she held the post of state librarian under the fusion state administration. In 1902 she traveled to England, and she remained abroad for two years, sending back articles and letters to newspapers on reform movements in Europe. In 1905 she was elected president of the Kansas Woman’s Press Association. In 1906 she suddenly moved to New York City, and thereafter she took no part in political affairs. She published two books, The Story of Jerry Simpson (1908), on her fellow Kansas Populist, and Bedrock (1912). She lived in Detroit from 1912 until her death.
