From its inception in 1888, Gobat worked with the Inter-Parliamentary Union, founded by William Randal Cremer, recipient of the Nobel Prize for Peace in 1903. In 1892 Gobat was president of the union’s fourth conference, which was held in Bern and which founded the Bureau Interparlementaire.

The third conference of the union, held in Rome in 1891, established the International Peace Bureau, of which Gobat was director when it was awarded the peace prize.
Among Gobat’s books on international affairs and history is Le Cauchemar de l’Europe (1911; “The Nightmare of Europe”).
