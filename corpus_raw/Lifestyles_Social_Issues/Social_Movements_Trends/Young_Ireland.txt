Young Ireland,   Irish nationalist movement of the 1840s. Begun by a group of Irish intellectuals who founded and wrote for the Nation, the movement advocated the study of Irish history and the revival of the Irish (Gaelic) language as a means of developing Irish nationalism and achieving independence. The influence of the group waned after a break with the National Repeal Association in 1846. In 1848 the movement came to an end when a revolt led by the radical wing of the Young Irelanders was suppressed.
