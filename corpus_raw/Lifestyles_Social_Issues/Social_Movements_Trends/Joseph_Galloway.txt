Joseph Galloway,  (born c. 1731, West River, Maryland [U.S.]—died August 29, 1803, Watford, Hertfordshire, England), distinguished American colonial attorney and legislator who remained loyal to Great Britain at the time of the American Revolution (1775–83). His effort in 1774 to settle differences peacefully narrowly missed adoption by the Continental Congress. He was, perhaps, the greatest of the colonial loyalists.
Entering law practice in Philadelphia in 1747, Galloway won a reputation by pleading cases before the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania before he was 20. Elected to the provincial assembly in 1756, he occupied the powerful post of speaker from 1766 to 1775. His “A plan of a proposed Union between Great Britain and the Colonies” in 1774 provided for a president general to be appointed by the king and a colonial legislature to have rights and duties similar to the House of Commons. After a day’s debate his plan was rejected by the Continental Congress by only one vote and was later expunged from the record.
In the belief that the Revolution was unreasonable and unjust, Galloway left Philadelphia and joined General Sir William Howe’s British army. He returned to the city as a civil administrator during the British occupation and drew up several plans of union after the Declaration of Independence with the hope that they might be used when the rebels had been defeated. With the reentry of the Continentals into Philadelphia in 1778 he fled to England, where he remained until his death.
