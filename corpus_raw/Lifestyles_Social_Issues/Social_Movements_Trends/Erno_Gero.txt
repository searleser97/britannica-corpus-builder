Ernő Gerő,  (born July 8, 1898, Terbegec, Austria-Hungary [now Trebušovce, Slovakia]—died March 12, 1980, Budapest, Hungary), Hungarian
communist and first secretary of the Hungarian Workers’ (communist) Party (1956). In that capacity Gerő served as the country’s last Stalinist leader before the Hungarian Revolution of 1956.
Gerő, the son of a shopkeeper and tenant farmer, entered the Budapest Medical Faculty (now Semmelweis University) in 1916 but never obtained his degree. In 1918 he became a member of the Hungarian Communist Party, and he spent much of his early career as an operative in many communist organizations. He served as minister in many governments and was the driving force behind rapid industrialization, demanding in 1950 that Hungary be made a “country of iron and steel.” On October 23, 1956, he made a pro-Soviet radio broadcast that fueled further popular unrest and brought large crowds into the streets to protest the oppression of the Hungarian people by the Hungarian and Soviet regimes. Unable to suppress the rebellion, Gerő called in Soviet troops, who fired on the demonstrators. He was replaced on October 25 as first secretary by János Kádár, who was then installed on November 4 as premier by the U.S.S.R. Although Gerő was initially believed to have been killed by rebels in Budapest, he escaped into exile in Moscow. He returned to Hungary in 1961, but he was never again to enter the corridors of power.
