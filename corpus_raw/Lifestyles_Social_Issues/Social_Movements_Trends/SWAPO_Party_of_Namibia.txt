SWAPO Party of Namibia, formerly South West Africa People’s Organization,  political party that began as a liberation movement in Namibia (formerly South West Africa) that advocated immediate Namibian independence from South Africa and became the country’s leading party following independence in 1990. It was founded in 1960, and, after South Africa refused a United Nations order to withdraw from the trust territory in 1966, SWAPO turned to armed struggle. SWAPO’s greatest political strength lay among the Ovambo people in the northern part of the territory. Led by Sam Nujoma and backed by the Angolan ruling party, Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, and the Soviet Union, SWAPO used Angola as a base for guerrilla warfare on Namibian soil; operations were carried out by SWAPO’s guerrilla force, the People’s Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN). Beginning in 1978 South Africa made periodic retaliatory land and air strikes into Angola. Herman Toivo ja Toivo, a cofounder of SWAPO, was imprisoned in South Africa for a 20-year term in 1968 but was released in 1984.
In 1978 the UN recognized SWAPO as the sole representative of the people of Namibia. Both SWAPO and South Africa agreed to a UN plan for a cease-fire, withdrawal of South African troops, and free elections to be guaranteed by UN security forces. After years of diplomatic maneuvering, South Africa finally accepted a UN resolution to that effect in December 1988. Sporadic fighting continued. In 1989 Nujoma was elected president, and SWAPO won a majority of the delegates selected by the country’s voters to write a constitution for an independent Namibia. The following year a new constitution was adopted, and Nujoma took office. SWAPO continued to dominate the political scene into the 21st century, transforming itself from a liberation movement into a governing party.
