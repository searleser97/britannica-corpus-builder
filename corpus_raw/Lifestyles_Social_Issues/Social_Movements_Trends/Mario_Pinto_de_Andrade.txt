Mário Pinto de Andrade, in full Mário Coelho Pinto De Andrade,  (born Aug. 21, 1928, Golungo-Alto, Angola—died August 26, 1990, London, Eng.), Angolan writer and nationalist leader.
While studying classical philology at the University of Lisbon, Andrade, with Agostinho Neto and Amilcar Cabral, formed the Centre for African Studies. He then attended the Sorbonne in Paris, wrote anticolonialist poetry, and was an editor of Présence Africaine (1955–58). Beginning in 1956 he worked with Neto to unite separate liberation groups within the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (Movimento Popular de Libertação de Angola [MPLA]), and he was elected its president when Neto was arrested in 1960; he resigned two years later when Neto escaped from detention in Portugal.
Andrade continued to be active in the MPLA’s struggle for Angolan independence until 1974, when, reportedly disillusioned with the movement’s authoritarian tendencies, he broke away to join Active Revolt, a dissident group. When Angola became independent in 1975, Neto became president and Andrade settled in Guinea-Bissau, where Cabral was president. There Andrade served in several government positions, including commissioner of culture. He edited several anthologies of African poetry written in Portuguese and shortly before his death was writing a history of nationalism in Portuguese-speaking Africa.
