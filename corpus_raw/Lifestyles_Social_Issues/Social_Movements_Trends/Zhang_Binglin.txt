Zhang Binglin, Wade-Giles romanization Chang Ping-lin, literary name Taiyan,  (born Jan. 12, 1869, Yuhang, Zhejiang province, China—died  June 14, 1936, Suzhou, Jiangsu province), Nationalist revolutionary leader and one of the most prominent Confucian scholars in early 20th-century China.
Zhang received a traditional education during which he was influenced by Ming dynasty (1368–1644) loyalist writers who had refused to serve the foreign Qing dynasty (1644–1911/12) established by the Manchu tribes of Manchuria. As a newspaper editor, Zhang expressed his belief that China’s problems resulted from imperial rule. Arrested in 1903 for his anti-imperial views, he was released from prison three years later and then went to Japan, where he became one of the chief polemicists for the Tongmenghui (“Alliance Society”), the revolutionary group organized in Tokyo the year before by the Chinese Nationalist leader Sun Yat-sen (Sun Zhongshan).
After the Chinese Revolution of 1911, however, Zhang was one of the first to sever his connection with the Tongmenghui. Yuan Shikai, president of the Chinese Republic, feared that Zhang was stirring up opposition to his regime, and he placed Zhang under house arrest in 1913. Yuan’s death in 1916 brought about Zhang’s release, and a year later he joined Sun Yat-sen’s new revolutionary government at Guangzhou (Canton) in South China. After 1918, however, he gradually retired from politics.
Zhang was better known for his scholarly works than for his revolutionary activity. As a staunch defender of his country’s ethical and cultural heritage, he was one of the major opponents of the movement to replace China’s highly stylized 2,000-year-old literary language with a written language that more closely approximated the spoken, or vernacular, tongue. Zhang’s own prose and poetic writings are considered among the finest examples of the classical form.
