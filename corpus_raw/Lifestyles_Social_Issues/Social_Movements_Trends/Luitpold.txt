Luitpold,   (born March 12, 1821, Würzburg, Bavaria—died  Dec. 12, 1912, Munich), prince regent of Bavaria from 1886 to 1912, in whose reign Bavaria prospered under a liberal government and Munich became a cultural centre of Europe.
The third son of King Louis (Ludwig) I, Luitpold chose a military career and fought on Austria’s side against Prussia in the Seven Weeks’ War (1866). During the later years of his nephew Louis II’s reign, he served as the king’s deputy, and, when it became clear that Louis was mentally unbalanced, Luitpold acted as regent, a post he continued to hold under Otto, his insane younger nephew. The regent’s patriarchal rule and his firm application of liberal principles soon won the public’s approval. Electoral reforms (1906), combined with the introduction of ministerial responsibility, made Bavaria the most democratically governed kingdom in Germany. Despite his reservations about the German emperor William II’s policies, Luitpold remained strictly loyal to the German government. The 26 years of Luitpold’s regency were regarded as a golden age for Bavaria. Munich, the capital, flourished under Luitpold’s patronage and came to be regarded as a centre of culture. The prince regent was a friend of many artists, and he spent large sums for cultural and artistic purposes and created the Künstlerhaus as a meeting place and exhibition centre. On Luitpold’s death, his eldest son became regent and then king as Louis III.
