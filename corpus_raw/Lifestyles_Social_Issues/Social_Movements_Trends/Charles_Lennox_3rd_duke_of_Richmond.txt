Charles Lennox, 3rd duke of Richmond,  (born February 22, 1735, London, England—died  December 29, 1806, Goodwood, Sussex), one of the most progressive British politicians of the 18th century, being chiefly known for his advanced views on parliamentary reform.
Richmond succeeded to the peerage in 1750 (his father, the 2nd duke, having added the Aubigny title to the Richmond and Lennox titles in 1734). He was British ambassador extraordinary in Paris in 1765 and the following year became a secretary of state in the marquess of Rockingham’s administration, resigning office on the accession to power of William Pitt the Elder. In the debates on the policy that led to the American Revolution Richmond was a firm supporter of the colonists; he initiated the debate in 1778 calling for the removal of the troops from America, during which Pitt was seized by his fatal illness. He also advocated a policy of concession in Ireland, with reference to which he originated the phrase “a union of hearts,” which long afterward became famous when his use of it had been forgotten. In 1780 Richmond embodied in a bill his proposals for parliamentary reform, which included manhood suffrage, annual parliaments, and equal electoral areas.
Richmond sat in Rockingham’s second cabinet as master-general of ordnance, and in 1784 he joined the ministry of William Pitt the Younger. He now developed strong Tory opinions, and his alleged desertion of the cause of reform led to a violent attack on him by the 8th earl of Lauderdale in 1792, which nearly led to a duel between the two noblemen.
