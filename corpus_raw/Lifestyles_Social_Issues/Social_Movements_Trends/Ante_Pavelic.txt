Ante Pavelić,  (born July 14, 1889, Bradina, Bosnia—died  Dec. 28, 1959, Madrid), Croatian fascist leader and revolutionist who headed a Croatian state subservient to Germany and Italy during World War II.
As a practicing lawyer in Zagreb, Pavelić entered the nationalist Croatian Party of Rights. In 1920 he was elected city and county alderman at Zagreb. From 1927 to 1929 he was a representative in the Yugoslav Skupština (parliament), in which he vigorously opposed centralization of the country. When King Alexander assumed dictatorial power (1929), Pavelić fled to Italy and organized a group of Croatian terrorists known as the Ustaše (q.v.). They achieved their greatest success in organizing the assassination of King Alexander in Marseille on Oct. 9, 1934.
After the conquest of Yugoslavia by Axis forces in April 1941, Pavelić was installed as head (poglavnik) of the Independent State of Croatia, which included Bosnia and part of Dalmatia. Under the Ustaše regime, whose slogan was “Za dom Spremni” (“Ready for the Fatherland”), a brutal program of oppression was conducted against the Orthodox Serbs and the Jews. With the defeat of his German sponsors in May 1945, Pavelić left Croatia and went into hiding in Austria and Italy, finally escaping to Argentina in 1948. He survived an assassination attempt in 1957 but soon fled to Paraguay; he later settled in Spain.
