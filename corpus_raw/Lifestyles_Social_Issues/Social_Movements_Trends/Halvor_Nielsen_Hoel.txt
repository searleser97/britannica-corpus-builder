Halvor Hoel,  (born Feb. 4, 1766, Hedmark province, Nor.—died  March 5, 1852, Hedmark), peasant agitator who influenced peasant opinion against Norway’s early 19th-century political leaders.
A member of a wealthy peasant family, Hoel opposed the upper-class, urban-dominated parliamentary government established in Norway in 1814; particularly, he attacked its fiscal policies, which he characterized as inimical to peasant interests. On the other hand, he exhibited the traditional peasant tolerance of royalism and favoured a strengthening of the role of the Swedish-Norwegian monarch.
Hoel was elected to the Storting (parliament) in 1815 but was denied his seat because he had not been completely exonerated of a previous criminal charge. He nevertheless continued to agitate among the peasantry with great effect. In 1818, during the coronation of King Charles XIV in the Norwegian city of Trondheim, large-scale peasant demonstrations and disorders occurred. Influenced by Hoel’s polemics, the peasants called for reduced taxes, abolition of Norway’s Parliament, and royal rule under the union’s king. Although Hoel had advised against demonstrations, he was convicted of instigating the disturbances in 1826 and was sentenced to a year in prison. The king, however, reduced the sentence to one month and placed Hoel on a royal pension.
