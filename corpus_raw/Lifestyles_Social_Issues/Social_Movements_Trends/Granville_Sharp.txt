Granville Sharp,  (born Nov. 10 [Nov. 21, New Style], 1735, Durham, Durham, Eng.—died  July 6, 1813, Fulham, London), English scholar and philanthropist, noted as an advocate of the abolition of slavery.
Granville was apprenticed to a London draper, but in 1758 he entered the government ordnance department. A diligent student of Greek and Hebrew, he published several treatises on biblical criticism. His fame rests, however, on his untiring efforts for the abolition of slavery.
In 1767 he became involved in litigation with the owner of a slave called Jonathan Strong, in which it was decided that a slave remained in law the chattel of his master even on English soil. Sharp devoted himself to fighting this judgment both with his pen and in the courts of law; and finally it was laid down in another case he took up, that of James Somersett (1772), that “as soon as any slave sets foot upon English territory, he becomes free.” (This decision did not include the colonies, however.)
Sharp advocated the cause of the American colonies, supported parliamentary reform at home and the legislative independence of Ireland, and agitated against the press-gang. In 1787 he founded a society for the abolition of slavery, and he was a joint founder of the British and Foreign Bible Society and the Society for the Conversion of Jews.
