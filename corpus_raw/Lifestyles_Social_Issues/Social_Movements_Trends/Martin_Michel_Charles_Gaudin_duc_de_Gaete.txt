Martin-Michel-Charles Gaudin, duke de Gaëte,  (born Jan. 19, 1756, Saint-Denis, Fr.—died  Nov. 5, 1841, Gennevilliers), French finance minister throughout the French Consulate and the First Empire (1799–1814) and founder of the Bank of France (1800).
From 1773 Gaudin worked in those bureaus of the Contrôle Générale des Finances that handled the collection of taxes, and he eventually rose to be a head of the tax department. In 1791, during the French Revolution, he was made a member of the commission in charge of the national treasury, but he resigned in 1795. Although offered the Ministry of Finance by the Directory, Gaudin twice refused (in 1795 and July 1799), accepting the post only on Nov. 10, 1799, after Napoleon Bonaparte’s coup d’état.
As the minister in charge of tax collections, Gaudin worked hard to preserve the framework of the ancien regime’s financial institutions while trying to make them more efficient and to adopt some of the innovations introduced by the Revolution. He created a body of permanent officials to assess and levy direct taxes, and he reimposed certain major indirect taxes in 1804. Gaudin also proposed a fairer distribution of the land tax, and in 1807 he helped to introduce the cadastre, a survey and official register of all the land in France for taxing purposes (authorized in 1791 but not enforced). Gaudin was an honest and methodical financial administrator, and for his conscientious efforts, Napoleon made him Duke de Gaëte (Gaeta) in 1809.
Later Gaudin served as a moderate deputy for Aisne in the Chambre Introuvable (1815–16) and again in the succeeding Chamber of Deputies (1816–18). He then served as governor of the Bank of France (1820–34). His Mémoires, souvenirs, opinions et écrits (1826–34) was published in three volumes. A new edition appeared in 1926.
