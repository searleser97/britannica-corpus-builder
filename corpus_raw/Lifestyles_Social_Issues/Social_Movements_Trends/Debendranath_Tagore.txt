Debendranath Tagore, Debendranath also spelled Devendranath, Bengali Debendranāth Ṭhākur,  (born May 15, 1817, Calcutta [now Kolkata], India—died January 19, 1905, Calcutta), Hindu philosopher and religious reformer, active in the Brahmo Samaj (“Society of Brahma,” also translated as “Society of God”).
Born into a wealthy landowning family, Tagore began his formal education at the age of nine; he was taught Sanskrit, Persian, English, and Western philosophy. He became a close friend of his younger fellow reformer Keshab Chunder Sen. Tagore spoke out vehemently against suttee (self-immolation of a widow on her husband’s funeral pyre), a practice that was especially prevalent in Bengal. Together, Tagore and Sen attempted to raise the Indian literacy rate and to bring education within the reach of all. Unlike Sen, however, Tagore remained a more conservative Hindu, while Sen drifted toward Christianity. This philosophical break between the two men eventually resulted in a schism within the Brahmo Samaj in 1866.
Tagore, in his zeal to erase from Hinduism the abuses of the lower castes as well as the worship of gods through their images (murtis), finally rejected the whole of the Vedas, the ancient Hindu scriptures, claiming that no set of writings, however venerable, could furnish complete and satisfying guidelines to human activity. Failing to find a middle path between radical rationalism and fanatical Brahman conservatism, Tagore retired from public life, although he continued to instruct a small band of followers. In 1863 he founded Shantiniketan (“Abode of Peace”), a retreat in rural Bengal later made famous by his poet son Rabindranath Tagore, whose educational centre there became an international university. Until his death Debendranath Tagore bore the title Maharishi (“Great Sage”).
Tagore wrote voluminously in his native Bengali. His Brahmo-Dharma (1854; “The Religion of God”) is a commentary on the Sanskrit scriptures.
