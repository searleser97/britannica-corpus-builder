José Luandino Vieira, original name José Vieira Mateus da Graça,  (born May 4, 1935, Lagoa de Furadouro, Portugal), Angolan writer of short fiction and novels.
Vieira immigrated with his parents to Angola in 1938, living in and around the musseques (African quarters) of Luanda. His writings reflect the fusion of Kimbundu (the language of the Mbundu people) and a variety of Portuguese that is the unique language of the musseque. Vieira, a white Angolan, committed himself early to the overthrow of the Portuguese colonial government and was arrested in 1961 for disclosing, during a BBC interview, secret lists of deserters from the Portuguese armies fighting in Africa. He spent 11 years in prison, mostly at Tarrafal, Cape Verde Islands.
Vieira is best known for his early collection of short stories, Luuanda (1963). The book, which received a Portuguese writers’ literary award in 1965, was banned until the overthrow of the colonial government in 1974. Although the stories are not overtly political, their realism makes clear the oppressiveness of Portuguese occupation. Many of Vieira’s stories follow the traditional structure of African oral narrative. His political novella A vida verdadeira de Domingos Xavier (1974; The Real Life of Domingos Xavier) portrays the cruelty of white “justice” and the courage of African men and women in preindependent Angola. His other works—among them Velhas estórias (1974; “Old Stories”), Nós os do Makulusu (1974; “Our Gang from Makulusu”), Vidas novas (1975; “New Lives”), and João Vêncio: os sues amores (1979; The Loves of João Vêncio)—include both novels and collections of stories. In 2003 Vieira published the novel Nosso musseque (Our Musseque).
As secretary-general of the Union of Angolan Writers, Vieira directed the publication of a number of works by other Angolan authors and poets.
