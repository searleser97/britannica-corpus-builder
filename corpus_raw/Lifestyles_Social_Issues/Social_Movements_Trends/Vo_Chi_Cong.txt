Vo Chi Cong,  (born 1912, Quang Nam province, Annam (now in Vietnam)—died September 8, 2011, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam), strongly anti-French Communist revolutionary who was among the earliest fighters for Vietnam’s independence. He held key positions in South Vietnam’s National Liberation Front (NLF) and the Provisional Revolutionary Government—both political arms of the Viet Cong guerrillas—during the Vietnam War.
Cong began an activist career in 1930 under Phan Boi Chau and Phan Chau Trinh, early nationalist rebels against the French colonial regime. During World War II he participated in the underground resistance against Japan and the Vichy French, who arrested him and kept him under surveillance in 1942.
It was not until 1961 that he emerged into political significance as a founding member of the NLF. Cong was the chief organizer of the People’s Revolutionary Party, South Vietnam’s communist party, and became a strong opponent of Saigon’s U.S.-backed regime. After the reunification of Vietnam in 1976, he joined the new national government, serving as the minister of fisheries (1976–77) and of agriculture (1977–78) and as a deputy prime minister (1976–82). He also became a full member of the Politburo of the Vietnamese Communist Party in 1976.
