Corsican National Liberation Front, French Front de Libération Nationale de la Corse (FLNC),  largest and most violent of a number of Corsican nationalist movements. It was formed in 1976 from two smaller groups that sought autonomy for Corsica through armed struggle.
The main method of the FLNC was bomb attacks, and the main targets were the property of non-Corsican settlers. The group also targeted police stations, government offices (in both Corsica and France), banks, and other such buildings. In 1980 more than 375 bombings in Corsica alone were attributed to or claimed by the FLNC. For most of 1981, during the establishment of the socialist administration of François Mitterrand in France, the FLNC abstained from its activities, but the group soon resumed bombings in Corsica, dissatisfied with the measures taken. In 1982 the number of attacks rose, and in 1983 the FLNC resumed sporadic attacks on the French mainland. The organization continued its activities into the 21st century.
