Şükrü Saracoğlu,   (born 1887, Ödemiş, near Smyrna, Ottoman Empire [now in Turkey]—died  Dec. 27, 1953, Istanbul), statesman who served as prime minister of the Turkish republic from 1942 to 1946.
Having studied economics and political science in Geneva, Saracoğlu returned to Turkey in 1918 following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War I (1914–18). He joined the movement of Mustafa Kemal (later Atatürk) to resist the Allied occupation of Anatolia and in 1923 was elected to the Grand National Assembly as deputy for İzmir. He served as minister of finance (1927–30) and later prepared a report that served as the basis for reorganizing Turkey’s cotton industry. He was minister of justice from 1933 to 1938, when he became the minister of foreign affairs. He later served as president of the Assembly.
As foreign minister Saracoğlu concluded a treaty of alliance with Great Britain and France (1939), as a prerequisite of which France ceded to Turkey Hatay province with the Mediterranean port of Iskenderun (Alexandretta). His policy, nevertheless, was to maintain Turkish neutrality during World War II. As prime minister in 1942–46, he continued the neutrality policy until Turkey declared war on the Axis powers in February 1945, just before the war’s end.
Saracoğlu’s Cabinet was responsible for two major reform laws: the Tax on Capital (Varlik Vergisi), imposed on the commercial classes; and the Land Reform Law, which provided for the reappropriation of state and private estates to the landless peasants. In 1948 he was elected president of the Assembly, but he lost his seat as deputy for İzmir after the election of May 1950.
