Helen Suzman, née Gavronsky,  (born November 7, 1917, Germiston, South Africa—died January 1, 2009, Johannesburg), white South African legislator (1953–89), who was an outspoken advocate for the country’s nonwhite majority.
The daughter of Lithuanian Jewish immigrants, Suzman graduated (1940) from the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg with a degree in commerce. She served as a statistician with the War Supplies Board from 1941 to 1944 and then returned (1945–52) to her alma mater as a lecturer in economic history. In 1948, when the largely Afrikaner, proapartheid National Party won the national elections, Suzman joined the United Party, a moderate coalition of Afrikaners and English-speaking white South Africans. She was elected to Parliament in 1953.
Six years later she and 11 other liberal members of Parliament formed the aggressively antiapartheid Progressive Party; of the 12, only Suzman was returned to office in the elections of 1961. From 1961 to 1974 she was the sole antiapartheid member of Parliament. Serving as an advocate for the disenfranchised, Suzman was in constant conflict with her conservative colleagues—particularly P.W. Botha—and she often cast the lone vote against an increasing number of apartheid measures. Until her retirement in 1989, Suzman remained a consistent and significant presence in the South African Parliament, though after 1974 she was no longer the sole opposition voice.
Suzman continued her political activism after leaving Parliament. She was president of the South African Institute of Race Relations (1991–93), served on the Independent Electoral Commission that oversaw South Africa’s first democratic election in 1994, and was a member of the Human Rights Commission (1995–98). Suzman’s dedication to human rights and democracy garnered many honours and awards, and it led to the establishment of the Helen Suzman Foundation, an organization devoted to the promotion of liberal democracy.
