Wojciech Korfanty,  (born April 20, 1873, Siemianowice, Upper Silesia, Ger. [now in Poland]—died  Aug. 17, 1939, Warsaw), political leader who played a major role in the national reawakening of the Poles of Upper Silesia and who led their struggle for independence from Germany.
The son of a miner, Korfanty became a journalist and a member of the secret nationalist society “Z,” which resisted Germany’s attempt to Germanize Upper Silesia’s Polish population. He became Upper Silesia’s first Polish member of the Reichstag (the German parliament) in 1903, being reelected in 1907 and 1918, and served in the Prussian Diet from 1904 to 1918—to the dismay of the Prussian administration, the Catholic hierarchy, and local capitalists. After World War I he led the Polish demand for an Upper Silesian plebiscite. Although the majority of Silesian voters decided in favour of remaining part of Germany, Korfanty’s campaign efforts resulted in a pro-Polish majority in the southeastern industrial section of Upper Silesia (March 1921). After he had led an armed rebellion (May 1921), he induced the Allies to set the German–Polish border along a line in Silesia more favourable to Poland than previously intended.
In the newly restored Poland, he sat in the Constituent Assembly (1919–22) and the Parliament (1922–30) as a leader of the national bloc. Opposed to Józef Piłsudski’s dictatorial methods, he was imprisoned in 1930 but was soon released and entered the Senate. Having lived in Czechoslovakia from 1935, he returned to Poland on April 29, 1939, was arrested, and died soon after his release.
