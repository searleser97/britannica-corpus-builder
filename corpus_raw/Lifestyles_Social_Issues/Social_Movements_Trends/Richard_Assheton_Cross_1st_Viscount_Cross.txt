Richard Assheton Cross, 1st Viscount Cross,  (born May 30, 1823, Red Scar, near Preston, Lancashire, England—died January 8, 1914, Eccle Riggs, Broughton-in-Furness, Lancashire), British statesman responsible for the first urban renewal authorization in Great Britain, the Artizans’ and Labourers’ Dwellings Improvement Act (generally known as the first Cross Act) of 1875.
A lawyer and banker, Cross was a Conservative member of the House of Commons from 1857 to 1862 and from 1868 (when he defeated W.E. Gladstone for a Lancashire constituency) until 1886. In 1874 Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli appointed him home secretary. The Cross Act of 1875 empowered municipalities to buy and demolish slums and to build housing for rental. (The so-called second Cross Act, 1879, also dealt with housing.) Also in 1875 Cross carried through Parliament the Factory Act, regulating the employment of women and children in textile mills; the Public Health Act, a comprehensive sanitary code; and two statutes reinterpreting Gladstone’s trade-union legislation of 1871 in a sense more favourable to the unions.
Cross left office with Disraeli in 1880, served again as home secretary in the 3rd Marquess of Salisbury’s brief ministry of 1885–86, was created viscount in 1886, and held the secretaryship for India from that year until 1892. From 1895 to 1900 he was lord privy seal.
