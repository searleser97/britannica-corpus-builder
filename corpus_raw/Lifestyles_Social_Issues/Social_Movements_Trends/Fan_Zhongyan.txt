Fan Zhongyan, Wade-Giles romanization Fan Chung-yen, canonized name Wenzheng,  (born Sept. 9, 989, Xuzhou, Jiangsu province, China—died  1052, China), Chinese scholar-reformer who, as minister to the Song emperor Renzong (reigned 1022/23–1063/64), anticipated many of the reforms of the great innovator Wang Anshi (1021–86). In his 10-point program raised in 1043, Fan attempted to abolish nepotism and corruption, reclaim unused land, equalize landholdings, create a strong local militia system, reduce the labour services required of the people, and reform the civil service examination system. He objected to the nature of the examination, which tested stylistic elegance rather than economic or administrative ability. He proposed that the examination stress problems of history and politics. To train men to understand these areas, he proposed the establishment of a national school system. The emperor adopted the proposal but retreated one year later under the pressure of antireform forces, and Fan was sent out of the capital for local office services.
An ardent foe of Buddhism, Fan was widely respected as a great Confucian scholar. He helped create an interest in the Yijing (“Classic of Changes”) and the Zhongyong (“Doctrine of the Mean”), two Classics previously neglected. He helped foster the Neo-Confucian emphasis on filial piety and helped to make the clan an important institution officially supported by the state.
