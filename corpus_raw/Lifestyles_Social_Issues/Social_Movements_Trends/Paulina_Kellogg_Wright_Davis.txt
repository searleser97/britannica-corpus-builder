Paulina Kellogg Wright Davis, née Paula Kellogg,  (born Aug. 7, 1813, Bloomfield, N.Y., U.S.—died Aug. 24, 1876, Providence, R.I.),  American feminist and social reformer, active in the early struggle for woman suffrage and the founder of an early periodical in support of that cause.
Paulina Kellogg grew up from 1820, when her parents died, in the home of a strict and religious aunt in LeRoy, New York. Her plan to become a missionary was abandoned when she married Francis Wright, a merchant, in 1833. The two were active and enthusiastic supporters of temperance, abolition, women’s rights, and other reforms. They helped organize an antislavery convention held in Utica, New York, in October 1835 and endured mob violence for their pains. After her husband’s death in 1845, Wright continued to be active in reform work, and for a time she toured with a lecture on physiology and hygiene.
In 1849 Wright married Thomas Davis, a jewelry maker and Democratic politician of Providence. She took the lead in planning and arranging in Worcester, Massachusetts, the first National Woman’s Rights Convention, over which she presided in October 1850. She accompanied her husband to Washington, D.C., when he served a term in Congress (1853–55), and while there, in February 1853, she established The Una, one of the first women’s rights periodicals. In 1868 Davis was among the founders of the New England Woman Suffrage Association. In the 1869 split of the national suffrage movement, she followed Susan B. Anthony into the National Woman Suffrage Association, and she played a large part in organizing the association’s convention in New York City the following year.
