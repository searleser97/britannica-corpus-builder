Jaʿfar al-ʿAskarī, also called Jaʿfar Pasha,  in full Jaʿfar Pasha Ibn Muṣṭafā Ibn ʿabd Ar-raḥman Al-ʿaskarī,  (born 1887, Baghdad, Iraq, Ottoman Empire [now in Iraq]—died  Oct. 30, 1936, Baghdad), army officer and Iraqi political leader who played an important role in the Arab nationalist movements during and after World War I.
ʿAskarī was educated in Baghdad and in Istanbul and commissioned in the Ottoman Turkish army in 1909. He was sent in 1915 to join Turkish forces in Cyrenaica during World War I, but he was wounded and taken to Cairo as a prisoner by the British. When he learned of Ottoman attempts to repress Arab nationalists in Syria, he decided to join Ḥusayn ibn ʿAlī, the emir of Mecca, who, with British aid, had declared a revolt against Ottoman authority in that city. By 1916 ʿAskarī had assumed the burden of organizing Ḥusayn’s newly formed Arab army, and he subsequently commanded it in operations against the Turks in the Hejaz and Syria. After the war he served in the administration of an Arab state in Syria headed by Ḥusayn’s son, Fayṣal. French military intervention caused the state’s collapse, but Fayṣal, with British support, became king (as Fayṣal I) of a newly founded Iraqi national government in 1921.
As independent Iraq’s first minister of defense, ʿAskarī is considered the “father of the Iraqi army.” Thereafter he served twice as Iraqi prime minister, among other posts, and was generally a pillar of the new Iraqi monarchy. In 1936 Bakr Ṣidqī overthrew the Iraqi government and ordered ʿAskarī’s execution.
