Leo Frobenius, in full Leo Viktor Frobenius,  (born June 29, 1873, Berlin, Germany—died August 9, 1938, Biganzolo, Italy), German explorer and ethnologist, one of the originators of the culture-historical approach to ethnology. He was also a leading authority on prehistoric art.
Largely self-educated as a social scientist, Frobenius led 12 expeditions to Africa between 1904 and 1935 and explored centres of prehistoric art in the Alps, Norway, Spain, and northern and southern Africa. Frobenius attributed a common origin to the cultures of Oceania and West Africa. He advocated the idea of cultural diffusion and arranged areas of the same cultural distribution into what he called Kulturkreise (cultural clusters, or cultural complexes). This concept was further extended by Fritz Graebner.
Frobenius began examining the nature of culture in the first volume of his Probleme der Kultur, 4 vol. (1899–1901; “Problems of Culture”). Frobenius wrote many articles and pamphlets and 60 books, including Und Afrika sprach, 3 vol. (1912–13; The Voice of Africa), and Erlebte Erdteile, 7 vol. (1925–29; “Parts of the Earth Experienced”). In 1932 he began teaching cultural anthropology at the University of Frankfurt am Main and from 1934 was director of the Municipal Museum of Ethnology, Frankfurt.
