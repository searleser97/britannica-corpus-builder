Wang Fuzhi, Wade-Giles romanization Wang Fu-chih,  (born Oct. 7, 1619, Hengyang, Hunan province, China—died Feb. 18, 1692, Hengyang), Chinese nationalistic philosopher, historian, and poet in the early years of the Qing dynasty (1644–1911), whose works were revived by Chinese nationalists in the middle of the 19th century.
Born and educated during the last years of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), Wang was an ardent patriot who bitterly resisted the invasion of China by the Manchu tribes of Manchuria and their subsequent establishment of the Qing dynasty. He raised an army and joined the resistance led by the last remnants of the Ming dynasty. By 1650, however, he realized the cause was hopeless. The next year he returned to his native village where he devoted his life to study, writing works on history, philosophy, and literature. His best-known studies are the Dutongjian lun (“Commentary on Reading the Comprehensive Mirror” of Sima Guang) and the Song lun (“Commentary on the Song”), in which he clearly demonstrated the differences between the institutions of ancient China that were sanctified in the Confucian Classics and the institutions of the Chinese dynasties that followed the feudal period in which those classics were written.
He argued that the ancient institutions were not relevant to his own time and that the purpose of the state was to serve the people. At a time when nationalistic feelings were still unknown in China, he argued that the ultimate aim of the government should be the preservation of the Chinese people and their culture. Ethics were important only if they first served to preserve the race. Alien rulers were impermissible, no matter how sinicized they seemed, and Wang glorified past heroes who fought to save Chinese land from encroachment by various Central Asian barbarians.
