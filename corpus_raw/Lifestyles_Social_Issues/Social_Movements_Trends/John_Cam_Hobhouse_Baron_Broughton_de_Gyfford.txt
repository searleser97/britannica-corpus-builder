John Cam Hobhouse, Baron Broughton, also called (1831–51) Sir John Cam Hobhouse, 2nd Baronet,  (born June 27, 1786, Redland, Gloucestershire, Eng.—died June 3, 1869, London), British politician and literary personage known as the alleged coiner of the phrase “His Majesty’s Opposition” (implying the continued loyalty of a major party when out of power) and as a close friend of Lord Byron. On his advice, Byron’s memoirs were destroyed (after the poet’s death in 1824) by their owner, the publisher John Murray.
Hobhouse and Byron, who had become acquainted at Trinity College, Cambridge, travelled together in Europe in 1809–10 and in 1816–17. In the 1820s he shared Byron’s enthusiasm for Greek independence from Ottoman Turkey. Imprisoned (1819–20) for his pamphlet attacking the unreformed House of Commons, he was then (1820) elected to that body. In 1825 he secured the prohibition of night labour by children in factories. After the enactment of major parliamentary reform in 1832, Hobhouse (2nd baronet from 1831) became increasingly conservative.
Hobhouse served as secretary at war (1832–33), chief secretary for Ireland (1833), first commissioner for woods and forests (1834), and president of the Board of Control for India (1835–41, 1846–52). While heading the India Board, he supported the anti-Russian policy of the foreign secretary, Lord Palmerston. In 1851 he was created a baron, a title that became extinct upon his death; his baronetcy descended to a nephew. His Recollections of a Long Life, privately printed in 1865, was published, 6 vol. (1909–11) by his daughter Charlotte, Baroness Dorchester.
