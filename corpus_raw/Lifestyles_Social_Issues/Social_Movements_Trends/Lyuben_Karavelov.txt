Lyuben Stoychev Karavelov,  (born 1834, Koprivshtitsa, Rumelia [now in Bulgaria]—died  Jan. 21, 1879, Ruse, Bulg.), Bulgarian writer and revolutionary who contributed to the national reawakening of Bulgaria.
Emigrating to Russia at 23, Karavelov studied ethnography in Moscow, where he was greatly influenced by Russian radical thought, and soon began writing political polemics and tales and studies of his homeland for various periodicals. Because his safety was threatened by his revolutionary contacts, he moved to Serbia (1867) but was shortly expelled for collaborating with the Serbian liberal opposition. Later, moving to Bucharest, he took up the Bulgarian revolutionary cause in his journals Svoboda (1869–72; “Freedom”) and Nezavisimost (1873–74; “Independence”), but his spirit was eventually broken by revolutionary failures, personal hardship, and betrayal. An important figure in Bulgarian letters, his leading works include the patriarchal novel Bălgare ot staro vreme (1867; “Bulgars of Olden Times”) and his pictures from Bulgarian life Maminoto detentse (1875; “Mother’s Child”).
