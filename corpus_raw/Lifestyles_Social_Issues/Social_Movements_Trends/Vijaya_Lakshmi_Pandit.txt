Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, née Swarup Kumari Nehru,  (born Aug. 18, 1900, Allahābād, India—died  Dec. 1, 1990, Dehra Dun), Indian political leader and diplomat, one of the world’s leading women in public life in the 20th century.
She was the daughter of Motilal Nehru, a wealthy and aristocratic nationalist leader, and sister of Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of independent India. In 1921, after receiving a private education in India and abroad, she married Ranjit Sitaram Pandit (d. 1944), a fellow Congress worker. (In accordance with conservative Hindu custom, her name was wholly changed upon her marriage, to reflect her husband’s clan.) In her family’s tradition she became an active worker in the Indian nationalist movement and was imprisoned three times by the British authorities in India. She entered municipal government in Allahābād (western India) before entering the legislative assembly of the United Provinces (later Uttar Pradesh) and becoming minister for local self-government and public health (1937–39), the first Indian woman to hold a cabinet portfolio.
With the coming of Indian independence, Pandit entered on a distinguished diplomatic career, leading the Indian delegation to the United Nations (1946–48, 1952–53) and serving as India’s ambassador to Moscow (1947–49) and to Washington and Mexico (1949–51). In 1953 Pandit became the first woman to be elected president of the UN General Assembly. From 1954 to 1961 she was Indian high commissioner (ambassador) in London and concurrently ambassador to Dublin. She served as governor of the state of Mahārāshtra from 1962 to 1964, and from 1964 to 1968 she was a member of the Indian Lok Sabha (parliament), representing the constituency formerly represented by Jawaharlal Nehru.
In 1977 Pandit left the Congress Party to join the Congress for Democracy, which had merged with the Janata Party. A year later she was appointed the Indian representative to the UN Human Rights Commission, and in 1979 she published The Scope of Happiness: A Personal Memoir.
