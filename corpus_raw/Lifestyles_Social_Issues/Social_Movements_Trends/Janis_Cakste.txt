Janis Čakste,  (born Sept. 14, 1859, Lielsesava, Courland, Russian Empire [now in Latvia]—died  March 14, 1927, Riga, Latvia), patriot and president (1922–27) of the Republic of Latvia, who, through political activity in Latvia and Russia and on diplomatic missions to the West, helped spearhead Latvia’s struggle for independence.
After serving as a lawyer for some years in the Courland public prosecutor’s office, Čakste left public service in 1888 to practice law in Jelgava and edit a Latvian newspaper, Tevija (“Fatherland”). He served on a committee appointed by the local administration to inquire into agricultural conditions in Courland (1902) and was frequently a member of Russian imperial government committees. He was elected to the first Russian Duma (Assembly) in 1906, and, after the Duma was dissolved by the imperial government, he was one of those who signed the Viborg protest and consequently lost his political privileges.
When the German invasion of Courland (July 1915) in World War I obliged him to leave Jelgava, Čakste moved to Petrograd, where he was one of the founders of the Latvian Refugees Committee, which, in addition to providing relief for war refugees, worked for Latvian autonomy. In 1916 he went to Stockholm to promote the cause of Latvian independence and there wrote Die Letten und ihre Latwija (1917; “The Letts and Their Latvia”). Elected chairman of the Latvian People’s Council in 1918, he was later the head of the delegation sent to London and to the Paris Peace Conference to secure the recognition of the Latvian republic. While he was absent on that mission, Čakste was elected president of the National Council (1918); he was later elected president of the Latvian constituent assembly (1920) and, when the first Saeima (Parliament) convened, president of the Republic of Latvia (Nov. 14, 1922). He was reelected in November 1925 and died in office.
