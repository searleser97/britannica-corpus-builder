Destour, byname of al-Ḥizb al-Ḥurr al-Dustūrī al-Tūnisī, English Tunisian Liberal Constitutional Party,  Tunisian political party, especially active in the 1920s and ’30s in arousing Tunisian national consciousness and opposition to the French protectorate.
The forerunner of the Destour, the Young Tunisians, had engaged the Tunisian intellectual elite but lacked widespread support. Forced underground in 1912 after the arrest of its leaders Ali Bash Hamba and Sheikh ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz al-Thaʿālibī, the Young Tunisians reemerged on June 4, 1920, as the Destour party. Arguing that the legal force of the suspended Tunisian constitution (dustūr) of 1861 could still be rightfully reinstated by the Tunisians, they began by advocating complete independence from France. When conservative Tunisians balked at this, they accepted the protectorate temporarily. When the French began encroaching on traditionally Muslim prerogatives in the early 1930s—as by setting up French judges in Tunisian law courts—the Destour organized and led protests, strikes, and boycotts.
The Destour was officially proscribed in May 1933, and in March 1934 some of its younger members broke away to form their own organization, the Neo-Destour (later the Democratic Constitutional Rally). The old Destour made several unsuccessful attempts to regain its influence in the 1940s and ’50s before finally passing out of existence in 1957.
