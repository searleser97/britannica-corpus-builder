Guadalupe Victoria, original name Manuel Félix Fernández,  (born 1786, Tamazuela, Mex.—died 1843, Perote), Mexican soldier and political leader who was the first president of the Mexican Republic.
Victoria left law school to join the movement for independence from Spain, fighting under José María Morelos in 1812. He changed his name to show his devotion to the cause of Mexican independence (the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe, the patron saint of Mexico, had been adopted as a symbol of the insurgency). After the death of Morelos, Victoria waged guerrilla war against the Spaniards from the mountains around Veracruz and Puebla. When Agustín de Iturbide came to power (1821), Victoria at first supported him, but by 1822, as Iturbide arrested all political opponents and dissolved the legislature, Victoria denounced him and joined Antonio López de Santa Anna’s successful revolt in 1823.
Victoria became Mexico’s first elected president (1824–29), but, while honest, unassuming, and a courageous general, he was not particularly suited for the presidency. The inexperienced administrator was not able to deal effectively with the constant political bickering and Byzantine machinations of government rivals, often being taken advantage of by those he trusted. It is small wonder that little progress was made domestically and the economy was in a shambles. During Victoria’s tenure in office, Iturbide was executed. In foreign affairs, Victoria managed much better and established relations with all the major powers. The bitterest blow of his term came in 1827 when his vice president, Nicolás Bravo, led a revolt against Victoria. It was easily suppressed by his comrades from revolutionary times, Generals Santa Anna and Vicente Guerrero.
