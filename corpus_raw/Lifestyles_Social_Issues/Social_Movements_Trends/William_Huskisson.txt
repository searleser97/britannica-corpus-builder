William Huskisson,  (born March 11, 1770, Birch Moreton, Worcestershire, Eng.—died Sept. 15, 1830, Eccles, Lancashire), British statesman and a leading advocate of free trade.
In 1793 Huskisson was employed by Henry Dundas (later Lord Melville) as a clerk. His abilities were so marked that in 1795 he was appointed undersecretary for war. He was a member of Parliament from 1796 to 1802 and again from 1804 to the year of his death. He was also secretary to the Treasury under William Pitt (1804–05) and the Duke of Portland (1807–09). He resigned from the cabinet in 1809 but rejoined in 1814.
After participating prominently in the Corn Law debates of 1814 and 1815 on regulation of the export and import of grain, Huskisson was appointed to the committee that was set up in 1821 to inquire into agricultural distress, and, subsequently, he led the committee to propose relaxation of the Corn Laws. Once he became president of the Board of Trade in 1823, he attempted to reconcile the Tory merchants to a free-trade policy. Among the chief legislative changes with which he was principally connected were the reform of the Navigation Acts, to admit other nations to a full equality and reciprocity of shipping duties, and the reduction of the duties on manufactures and on imports. In 1827 Huskisson became secretary for the colonies and leader of the House of Commons, but he resigned in 1828. Huskisson was fatally injured at the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway.
