Kārlis Ulmanis,  (born September 4, 1877, Berze, Latvia, Russian Empire—died 1942), a leader in the fight for Latvian independence in the early decades of the 20th century. He was the first head of the Latvian Republic in 1918 and again in 1936–40 and was premier in 1918, 1919–21, 1925–26, 1931–32, and 1934–40.
Ulmanis studied agronomy in Germany as a young man and afterward worked to improve dairy farming and cattle breeding in Latvia. During the period of upheaval at the time of the Russian Revolution of 1905, he worked to promote freedom from Russia, which had controlled the country for more than a century. The defeat of the revolution forced Ulmanis to seek exile in the United States, where he taught in the agriculture department of the University of Nebraska.
In 1913 he was granted amnesty by the Russian government and returned to Latvia. At the time of the Russian Revolution of 1917, he founded the Latvian Farmers’ Union to press for independence. Then with other nationalists he formed a Latvian national council that proclaimed independence on November 18, 1918, and appointed Ulmanis head of the provisional government.
He remained in power until June 1921, during the confused period immediately following the end of World War I, when the new nation was forced to fight to maintain itself in the face of threats, pressure, and military action from Russia, native Latvian Communists, and German forces. With a Latvian army formed by Gen. Jānis Balodis and supported on occasion by French and British naval forces and Polish troops, the new government was able to clear the country of opposition. Ulmanis organized the election of a constituent assembly, and the first Saeima (parliament) convened on August 11, 1920. That same month peace was concluded with the Soviet Union.
Ulmanis again served as premier from December 1925 to May 1926 and from March 1931 to December 1932. He came to power for the last time on March 17, 1934, during a period of great tension created by the demands of right-wing nationalists and the Nazified German minority. On May 15, 1934, Ulmanis and General Balodis declared a state of siege, dissolving the Saeima and all political parties, and instituting authoritarian rule. In June 1940, under an ultimatum backed by Soviet military forces, Ulmanis resigned, and Russian forces occupied the country. Ulmanis was arrested on July 21, 1940, by Soviet authorities and deported to Russia.
