Rapparee,  any of the dispossessed native Irish who employed guerrilla methods to resist the English from the time of the English Civil Wars (1642–51) and more especially after the regular Irish army had surrendered in the Jacobite war (1689–91) in Ireland. They were termed rapparees after their weapons, short pikes (Irish: rápaire). The elusiveness of the rapparees confounded the British for a time, but superior forces, plus Britain’s ability to insulate Ireland from foreign, particularly French, support, ended the insurgency.
