Petko Rachev Slaveykov ,  (born Nov. 17, 1827, Turnovo, Bulg.—died  July 1, 1895, Sofia), writer who helped to enrich Bulgarian literature by establishing a modern literary language and introducing contemporary ideas from other European countries.
Slaveykov became an itinerant schoolteacher at age 17. His early poems were lyrical and patriotic (Smesena kitka [“Mixed Bouquet”] and Pesnopoyka [“Songbook”], both 1852), and, by reestablishing the vernacular as a medium for literature (the language of his translation of the Bible in 1862 was based on Bulgarian dialects), he prepared for the flowering of native poetry. As a patriot and politician, he helped to shape resurgent Bulgaria, producing political pamphlets notorious for their outspokenness against Turkish oppression and against the spiritual domination of the Greek patriarchate. In 1863 Slaveykov moved to Istanbul, where he contributed to Bulgarian émigré reviews and edited satirical and political periodicals. After Bulgaria’s liberation (1878) he became an active politician, both as president of the constituent assembly and as cofounder of the Democratic Party. Following the 1881 coup d’état, Slaveykov went to Plovdiv, then still under Turkish rule, and there edited the newspaper Nezavisimost (“Independence”). Pencho Petkov Slaveykov, his son, was also a noted writer.
