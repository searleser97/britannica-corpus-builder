Claude-Louis, count de Saint-Germain,  (born April 15, 1707, Château de Vertamboz, Fr.—died Jan. 15, 1778, Paris), French general who sought reforms in the French armies.
Saint-Germain entered the army but left France, apparently because of a duel, and fought in the armies of the elector palatine and the elector of Bavaria. Then, after a brief service under Frederick II the Great of Prussia, he joined Marshal Saxe in the Netherlands and was created a field marshal of the French army. On the outbreak of the Seven Years’ War (1756) he was appointed lieutenant general, but he fell a victim to court intrigues and professional jealousy. He resigned his commission in 1760 and accepted an appointment as field marshal from Frederick V of Denmark, being charged in 1762 with the reorganization of the Danish army. On the death of Frederick in 1766 he returned to France, bought a small estate in Alsace near Lauterbach, and devoted his time to religion and farming. In October 1775 he was appointed minister of war by Louis XVI, but his efforts to effect economies and to introduce Prussian discipline in the French army met such opposition that he resigned in September 1777.
