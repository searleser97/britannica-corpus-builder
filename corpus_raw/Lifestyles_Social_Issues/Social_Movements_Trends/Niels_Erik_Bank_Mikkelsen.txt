Niels Erik Bank-Mikkelsen,  (born March 29, 1919, Skjern, Denmark—died September 20, 1990, Roskilde), Danish reformer and advocate for people with intellectual disabilities who was an early champion of the normalization principle, which holds that the daily lives and routines of people with intellectual disabilities should be made to resemble those of the nondisabled to the greatest extent possible and that this could be achieved by teaching self-help skills and providing a variety of supportive services.
Bank-Mikkelsen joined the Danish resistance movement during World War II and was ultimately captured and interned in a Nazi concentration camp. Following the war, he earned a law degree from the University of Copenhagen and entered the Danish Ministry of Social Affairs. In 1950 he moved to the Danish Service for the Mentally Retarded, becoming departmental head in 1959.
Bank-Mikkelsen introduced the concept of normalization in a piece of Danish legislation called the 1959 Mental Retardation Act. He described normalization as a means to ensure people with intellectual disabilities the right to the same community-based existence as their peers without disabilities, including clothing, housing, education, work, and leisure. In 1971 he became the Director of the Department of Care and Rehabilitation of the Handicapped, Danish National Board of Social Welfare, and he was instrumental to the 1980 formation of Denmark’s Central Committee on the Handicapped.
