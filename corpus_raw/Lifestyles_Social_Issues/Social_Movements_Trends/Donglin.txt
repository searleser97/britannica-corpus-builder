Donglin, Wade-Giles romanization Tung-lin, also called Donglin Dang,  party of Chinese scholars and officials who attempted to combat the moral laxity and intellectual weakness they felt was undermining public life during the last years of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).
The party was founded by Gu Xiancheng, a government official forced out of office because of his outspoken criticism of those in power. In 1604 he established the Donglin (“Eastern Forest”) Academy at Wuxi in  southeast China as a centre for private learning and philosophic discussion. Many of the group that gathered around Gu were also active champions of governmental integrity; many were simply scholars; all were interested in returning to what they felt were the traditional Confucian values. Interpretations of this varied, but the Donglin scholars were united in their denunciation of Buddhist and Daoist influences that had crept into Confucian philosophy. Their prestige soon spread among scholar-officials, and between 1620 and 1623 they were able to dominate many government offices.
Their sense of moral outrage, however, made many enemies. When a Donglin leader, Yang Lian, attacked the powerful court eunuch Wei Zhongxian in 1624, Wei mobilized the enemies of the reformers. Over the next two years hundreds of Donglin supporters were barred from the government, and leading figures were tortured, imprisoned, and executed. By 1627, when Wei was forced to commit suicide under the succeeding emperor Chongzhen, the Donglin party had been practically wiped out (the remaining party members were rehabilitated the next year), but their martyrdom became an example to all of China.
