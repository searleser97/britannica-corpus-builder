John Howard,   (born Sept. 2, 1726, Hackney, London, Eng.?—died  Jan. 20, 1790, Kherson, Ukraine, Russian Empire [now in Ukraine]), English philanthropist and reformer in the fields of penology and public health.
On his father’s death in 1742, Howard inherited considerable wealth and traveled widely in Europe. He then became high sheriff in Bedfordshire in 1773. As part of his duties, he inspected Bedford jail and was appalled by the unsanitary conditions there. He was also shocked to learn that the jailers were not salaried officers but depended on fees from prisoners and that some prisoners had been acquitted by the courts but were kept in prison because they had not paid their fees. In 1774 Howard persuaded the House of Commons to pass two acts that stipulated (1) that discharged persons should be set at liberty in open court and that discharge fees should be abolished and (2) that justices should be required to see to the health of prisoners. Years afterward, however, Howard complained that the acts had not been “strictly obeyed.”
Howard continued to travel widely, touring Scotland, Ireland, France, the Netherlands, Germany, and Switzerland, often visiting local prisons. He was largely responsible for a parliamentary statute of 1779 that authorized the building of two penitentiary houses where, by means of solitary confinement, supervised labour, and religious instruction, the reform of prisoners might be attempted. This act, however, like those of 1774, was never effectively enforced.
He spent the last years of his life studying means of preventing plague and limiting the spread of contagious diseases. Traveling in Russia in 1790 and visiting the principal military hospitals that lay en route, he reached Kherson in Ukraine. In attending a case of camp fever that was raging there, he contracted the disease and died.
