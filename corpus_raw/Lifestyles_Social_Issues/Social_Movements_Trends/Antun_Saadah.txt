Anṭūn Saʿādah,  (born 1904—died  July 9, 1949, Beirut, Leb.), Syrian political agitator who sought to unify Syria with neighbouring areas that he considered really parts of Syria.
In 1921 Saʿādah went to Brazil to join his father, a physician and scholar, in the latter’s publishing business. He returned to Lebanon in 1930 and the following year went to Damascus, where he worked as an editor on the newspaper al-Ayyām. He then became a tutor in German at the American University of Beirut.
On Nov. 16, 1932, Saʿādah founded the Syrian Social Nationalist Party, a secret society that grew from a few students to about 1,000 members by 1935. During the 1930s the party expanded into Syria, Transjordan, and Palestine. Saʿādah had created perhaps the first indigenous Arab youth organization. It stressed discipline, struggle, and service and was a channel for the expression of discontent with French rule. (France had acquired a sphere of influence in Syria and Lebanon at the close of World War I.)
In December 1935 the party held its first plenary conference, after which Saʿādah was jailed by the French authorities. After a short while he was released from jail, having turned his trial to excellent use as a publicity forum. Toward the end of 1938 he visited Italy and Germany and then moved to South America before the start of World War II. In 1947 he returned to Beirut to renew his agitation for a united Syria. By June 1949 armed clashes erupted between Saʿādah’s followers, who had largely remained loyal, and another paramilitary organization that was their major local opposition. Saʿādah was forced to flee Syria, but the Syrian authorities eventually turned him over to the Lebanese government. In Beirut he was convicted of high treason by a military court and was executed, the whole proceeding taking less than 24 hours.
