Mikhail Tukhachevsky, in full Mikhail Nikolayevich Tukhachevsky,  (born February 16 [February 4, Old Style], 1893, near Slednevo, Russia—died June 11, 1937), Soviet military chief responsible for modernization of the Red Army prior to World War II.
Tukhachevsky was born to a noble family and graduated from the Alexandrovskoe Military Academy in 1914. He fought in World War I in the Imperial Army, and from 1918 he served as an officer in the Red Army—leading the defense of the Moscow district (1918), commanding forces on the Eastern Front (1918), commanding the Fifth Army in the recapture of Siberia from Adm. A.V. Kolchak, and heading Cossack forces against Gen. A.I. Denikin (1920). He also took part in the Russian war with Poland (1920–21) and in the suppression of the Kronshtadt Rebellion (1921).
After the end of the Civil War, Tukhachevsky played a leading role in military reforms and from 1931 directed the rearmament of the Soviet Union. He was responsible for extensive organizational streamlining and technological modernization of the Red Army and for the establishment of a series of modern military schools. He also wrote numerous books and articles on strategic considerations in modern warfare. He served as chief of staff (1925–28) and deputy commissar for defense (after 1931) and received the Order of Lenin for his contributions. In 1935 he was made a marshal of the Soviet Union.
Tukhachevsky was tried with seven other top Red Army commanders in June 1937, in conjunction with the Stalinist purges, on charges of conspiracy with Germany. All eight were convicted and executed. The purge of the Red Army’s officer corps followed. In 1988 he was cleared judicially and rehabilitated by official decree.
