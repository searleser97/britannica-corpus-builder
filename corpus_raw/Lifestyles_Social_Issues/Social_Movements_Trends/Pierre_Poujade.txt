Pierre Poujade, in full Pierre-Marie Poujade,  (born December 1, 1920, Saint-Céré, France—died August 27, 2003, La Bastide-l’Évêque), French bookseller, publisher, and politician who led a much publicized right-wing protest movement in France during the 1950s.
Poujade served (1939–40) in the aviation wing of the French army during World War II. He fled to Morocco in 1942 and then to England, where he joined the Royal Air Force in 1943. With the end of the war in 1945, he returned to Saint-Céré, where he opened a book and stationery store, and in 1951 he was elected to the municipal council. In 1953 he organized a local shopkeepers’ strike in order to protest heavy taxation and the prospective visit of government tax collectors. Expanding his activities to other towns in southern France, he enrolled 800,000 members in his Union de Défense des Commerçants et des Artisans (Union for the Defense of Tradesmen and Artisans). Poujadisme, as his movement was called, succeeded in reducing tax collection drastically in the south of France and resulted in various tax concessions by the National Assembly in 1955. His support came predominantly from discontented peasants and small merchants. The peak of Poujadisme occurred during the elections of January 1956, when Poujadiste candidates won 52 of 595 Assembly seats and received 2,576,133 votes. Thereafter his influence waned, and his candidates (with a fraction of their previous popular vote) won no seats in the elections of November 1958. Poujade himself was never a candidate for the Assembly, but he remained a municipal councillor. J’ai choisi le combat (1956; “I Have Chosen to Fight”) was his published manifesto.
During the 1970s and into 1980 Poujade founded and led both an organization dedicated to increasing the purchasing power of nonunion workers to protect their rights and an association that was chiefly concerned with the protection and efficient use of French energy resources.
