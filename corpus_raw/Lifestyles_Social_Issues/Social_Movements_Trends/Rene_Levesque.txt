René Lévesque,  (born August 24, 1922, Campbellton, New Brunswick, Canada—died November 1, 1987, Montreal, Quebec), premier of the French-speaking Canadian province of Quebec (1976–85) and a leading advocate of sovereignty for that province.
Lévesque went to school in Gaspésie and afterward to Laval University, Quebec. Already a part-time journalist while still a student, he broke off his law studies to serve in Europe (1944–45) as a reporter and correspondent attached to the U.S. forces. Back in Quebec after the war, he joined the international service of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in 1946, became a war correspondent in Korea in 1952, and from 1956 to 1959 was commentator on a popular TV news program.
Lévesque entered politics in 1960 and was elected to the Quebec National Assembly as a Liberal member for Gouin, joining Jean Lesage’s government as minister of public works and hydraulic resources (1960–61). He then held the newly created portfolio of natural resources (1961–65), and in 1966, during the last months of the Lesage government, he was minister of family and social welfare. Meanwhile he had been reelected in the constituency of Laurier in the 1962 and 1966 legislative elections.
In October 1967 Lévesque, with others, founded the Mouvement Souveraineté-Association, which the following year combined with other separatist groups to form the left-wing Parti Québécois, with Lévesque as its first president. He was unsuccessful in the elections of 1970 and 1973 and returned in part to journalism, writing daily political articles in the Journal de Montréal and the Journal de Québec, until 1976, when his party won control of the provincial National Assembly and he became the premier of Quebec. He was reelected premier in April 1981.
The goal of Lévesque and his Parti Québécois government was the independence option termed “sovereignty-association.” The concept envisaged Quebec enacting its own laws, collecting taxes from its people, and establishing relations with foreign countries. Simultaneously, it would form an economic union with the rest of Canada based on a common currency.
This plan was rejected by 59.6 percent of the Quebec electorate in a popular-referendum vote on May 20, 1980, amid one of the highest voter turnouts in Quebec’s history. Despite this serious setback to his plan for “sovereignty-association,” Lévesque (as his reelection demonstrates) retained his personal popularity.
In June 1985, largely because of failing health, Lévesque resigned from the leadership of the Parti Québécois and later gave up the premiership of Quebec, at a time when the power of his party was waning. For many Québécois he remains something of a modern folk hero for his spirited defense of their nationalism.
