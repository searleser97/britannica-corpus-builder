Imre Thököly,  (born September 25, 1657, Késmárk, Royal Hungary [now Kežmarok, Slovakia]—died September 13, 1705, İzmit, Ottoman Empire [now in Turkey]), Hungarian patriot, a leader of the Hungarian Protestants in their struggle against Austrian Habsburg rule.
The scion of a rich Protestant family, Thököly moved to Transylvania after his father was executed for having had a role in the Hungarian magnates’ conspiracy against the Habsburg emperor Leopold I (1670). His family properties sequestered, he later led the Hungarian Protestant resistance to the continuing repressive Habsburg policy and in 1680 was elected commander in chief of the malcontents. Aided by the emperor’s preoccupation with hostile France and backed by the Ottoman Turks and the prince of Transylvania, Thököly overran much of upper Hungary and forced Leopold to restore Hungarian liberties (Treaty of Sopron, 1681) and to recognize his own quasi-sovereignty in north Hungary. He soon resumed hostilities against the emperor, however, allying himself with the Turks and taking the title of prince over his own dominions. In 1683 he joined with the Turks in their final attempt to take Vienna. The siege was repulsed, however, and Thököly’s fortunes collapsed with those of his Turkish allies. His rebellion was crushed, his fortresses captured, and his wife taken in custody to Vienna. His fortunes briefly revived in 1690, when he was installed by the Turks as prince of Transylvania and defeated the imperial forces at Zernest (August 1690), but, after the Treaty of Carlowitz (1699), Ottoman influence was significantly diminished and Thököly was forced to spend his remaining years in exile in Turkey.
