Roque Sáenz Peña,   (born March 19, 1851, Buenos Aires—died  Aug. 9, 1914, Buenos Aires), president of Argentina from 1910 until his death, an aristocratic conservative who wisely responded to popular demand for electoral reform. Universal and compulsory male suffrage from age 18 by secret ballot was established (1912) in Argentina by a statute that he compelled an oligarchical legislature to pass and that has since been known by his name.
Sáenz Peña’s father, Luis, served as president of Argentina from 1892 to 1895. Roque, who inherited his father’s enemies, traveled in Europe before entering politics in the 1870s. He held the office of foreign minister, served as Argentine delegate to the first International Conference of American States (Washington, D.C., 1889–90), and was appointed ambassador to Spain (1901) and to Italy (1907). Intended in part to mollify Hipólito Irigoyen’s Radical Party, Sáenz Peña’s reforms made possible Irigoyen’s election to the presidency in 1916.
