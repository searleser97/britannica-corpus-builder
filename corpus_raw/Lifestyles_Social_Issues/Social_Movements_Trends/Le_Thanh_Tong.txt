Le Thanh Tong, also called Le Thanh Ton, or Thuan Hoang De,  (died 1497, Dong Kinh [now Hanoi, Vietnam]), the greatest ruler of the Later Le dynasty (q.v.; 1428–1788) in Vietnam. Though the early years of Le Thanh Tong’s reign were marked by a struggle for power, he eventually developed a governmental power base. He established a Chinese-style centralized administration and expanded dynastic control southward, at the expense of the once great kingdom of Champa, located on the southern coast of modern Vietnam.
Ascending the throne in 1460, Le Thanh Tong divided the empire into 13 circuits (similar to Chinese provinces), each of which was subdivided into prefectures (phu), districts (huyen), and departments (chau). These were ruled by centrally appointed officials, who were selected on the basis of their performance in the Confucian civil service examinations given every three years. The population was registered; a land tax (based on the nature of the crops and the amount of arable land) was instituted and revised triennially; new penal and civil codes were drawn up utilizing Confucian moral precepts; and, following the practices of the Chinese Ming dynasty (1368–1644), hortatory works of Confucian moral precepts were periodically read in every village in the country.
Continuing the southward push of his dynasty down the Vietnamese peninsula, Le Thanh Tong established a series of military colonies in the south. In 1471 he finally defeated Champa, ending the attacks on Vietnam by the Cham people. Champa was reduced to a narrow remnant along the southern edge of the peninsula.
