Davidson Don Tengo Jabavu,  (born Oct. 20, 1885, King William’s Town, Cape Colony [now in Cape Province, S.Af.]—died  Aug. 3, 1959, East London, S.Af.), black educator and South African political leader.
The son of John Tengo Jabavu, editor of the first Bantu-language newspaper in South Africa, Davidson Jabavu was educated in South Africa, in Wales, and at the universities of London and Birmingham. In 1916 he began teaching at Fort Hare Native College (later University College) in Fort Hare, Cape Province. In December 1935 he founded the All-African National Convention (AANC), which led the opposition to a series of bills whose purpose was to disfranchise black Africans, prevent them from owning land, and keep them from selling their labour freely. The convention brought together the entire spectrum of opposition to the white government and was instrumental in creating and organizing black African awareness of growing white militancy.
Jabavu became the leader of the Cape Native Voters’ Association at the first non-European conference held in South Africa. During the years 1945–47, the AANC became more militant, but by 1948 its membership had declined, and it disbanded. Jabavu retired from politics to devote his time to his post as professor of Latin and Bantu languages at University College, Fort Hare.
Jabavu was the author of The Black Problem (1920), The Segregation Fallacy and Other Papers (1928), The Influence of English on Bantu Literature (1943), and many volumes of poetry in the Xhosa language.
