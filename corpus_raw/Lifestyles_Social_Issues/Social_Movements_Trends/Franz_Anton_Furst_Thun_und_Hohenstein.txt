Franz Anton, prince zu Thun und Hohenstein,  (born September 2, 1847, Tetschen, Bohemia, Austrian Empire [now Děčín, Czech Republic]—died November 1, 1916, Tetschen), Austrian administrator, prime minister, and governor of Bohemia, who favoured compromise with Czech nationalists but was defeated by extremist Czech and German opposition.
Franz Anton was the son of Friedrich, Count von Thun und Hohenstein, and he shared the moderate pro-Czech views of his uncle Leo, Austrian minister for religious affairs and education. As governor of Bohemia from 1889, Franz supported a language compromise between Czechs and Germans. Disturbances by the nationalistic Young Czechs contributed to his resignation in 1895. Serving as Austrian prime minister from 1898 to 1899, he was ousted by German nationalists. Created a prince in 1911, he again held the governorship of Bohemia (1911–15).
