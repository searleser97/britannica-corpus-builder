Ch’oe Che-u,   (born 1824, North Kyŏngsang province, Korea [now in South Korea]—died  1864, Seoul), founder of the Tonghak sect, a religion amalgamated of Buddhist, Taoist, Confucian, and even some Roman Catholic elements with an apocalyptic flavour and a hostility to Western culture, which was then beginning to undermine the traditional Korean order. The sect, later known as the Ch’ŏndogyo (“Religion of the Heavenly Way”), was important in the modernization of Korea by advocating the strengthening of the country to combat foreign influences.
The son of a poor village scholar, Ch’oe repeatedly failed the civil-service examinations that he had to pass to qualify for high office. Then in May 1860, following news of China’s defeat by a combined British-French force in the “Arrow” War and the success of the great Christian-inspired Taiping Rebellion in South China, Ch’oe claimed he had received a mandate to create a religion that would make Korea as strong as the West. Calling his doctrine Tonghak (“Eastern Learning”), he taught that it was the duty of all men to “serve heaven.” If everyone believed, said Ch’oe, all would live in harmony with the “one heaven”; moreover, everyone would be equal before it.
Ch’oe’s new doctrine immediately gained a tremendous following, especially among the downtrodden, underprivileged peasants of southern Korea. Many were inspired to rise up against the government. That rebellion led to Ch’oe’s arrest and execution, along with 20 of his followers. Tonghak survived, however, and spread into every province in Korea, causing numerous peasant rebellions. Ch’oe’s emphasis on the need to strengthen the Korean nation to combat foreign influence provided later reformers with a strong rationalization for political and economic reforms.
