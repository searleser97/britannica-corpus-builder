Satō Nobuhiro,   (born July 18, 1769, Nishimonai, Dewa province [modern Akita prefecture], Japan—died  Feb. 17, 1850, Edo [now Tokyo]), scientist and an early advocate of Westernization in Japan. He favoured the development of an authoritarian type of government based on Western science and political institutions.
Satō was born into a family of agricultural and mining specialists. At an early age he attempted to add to his knowledge by learning the Dutch language (the Dutch were the only Westerners then permitted in Japan) and by studying Western treatises on science, history, and military tactics.
He wrote some of the first Japanese studies of Western geography, history, science, and artillery. By traveling extensively throughout Japan, he learned about the actual conditions of the people and advised government leaders on the establishment of coastal defenses against the Russians, whose ships could be seen off northern Japan by the beginning of the 19th century.
Satō was influenced by Japanese nationalist thought, and he began to develop a program designed to propel Japan to the status of a world power. His program for imperialist expansion involved the establishment of a new Japanese governmental system that would indoctrinate the people with a nationalistic ethos through rigid control of the population.
