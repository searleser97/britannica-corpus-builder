Aizawa Yasushi, also called Aizawa Seishisai,  (born July 5, 1782, Mito, Hitachi Province, Japan—died August 27, 1863, Mito), Japanese nationalist thinker whose writings helped provoke the movement that in 1868 overthrew the Tokugawa shogunate and restored power to the emperor.
Aizawa’s fief of Mito, one of the branches of the great Tokugawa family, was a centre of Confucian learning and loyalty. Thus, the threat to these traditional beliefs posed by growing contact with the West was keenly felt in Mito. Writing in the early 19th century, when Western ships were first beginning to be seen off the Japanese coast, Aizawa argued that the new “barbarians” had to be dealt with decisively, but that in order to do so Japan had to adopt certain Western military techniques and develop her armaments and defenses. Even so, contact with foreigners should be limited, according to Aizawa, for to encourage trade would undermine the Japanese nation. He realized that the real threat to the country was a weak, apathetic citizenry; strength could be ensured only through promotion of nationalistic sentiment, including loyalty to the emperor as the real sovereign.
According to Aizawa, Japan’s natural supremacy and its unique position at the centre of the world resulted from the fact that the Japanese ruling line was directly descended from Amaterasu (the sun goddess), and the basis of morality, which had become confused by the introduction of the false doctrines of Buddhism, was loyalty to the emperor; emperor worship thus provided the basis of later Japanese ultranationalism. Aizawa’s book Shinron (“New Proposals”), stressing the supremacy of the Japanese nation, remained influential well into the 20th century.
