John Hall,  (born August 1627, Durham, County Durham, Eng.—died  Aug. 1, 1656, Durham), educational reformer in Cromwellian England.
Educated at St. John’s College, Cambridge, and Gray’s Inn, London, Hall became associated as a young man with the circle of reformers around Samuel Hartlib. He was also a friend of Thomas Hobbes. A versatile writer, he worked for the newspapers Mercurius Britannicus and Mercurius Politicus (1650–53), a state publication, and thereafter served Oliver Cromwell’s government as a pamphleteer. In his major work, An Humble Motion to the Parliament of England Concerning the Advancement of Learning and Reformation of the Universities (1649), which was influenced by John Milton, Hall called for sweeping educational reform, especially in the universities. His emphasis was on the new science, mathematics, and foreign languages, while he criticized the university statutes because they hindered the introduction of new subjects and methodology. He complained of the misuse of the revenues of the universities and suggested that they be used to support more professorships and fewer fellowships. His publications include poetry, essays, satire (especially on Presbyterianism), and translations of historical, humanistic, and utopian works.
