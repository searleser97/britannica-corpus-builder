Young Algerians,  Algerian nationalist group. Formed shortly before World War I (1914–18), they were a loosely organized group of French-educated workers in the modernized French sector. The Young Algerians were “assimilationists,” willing to consider permanent union with France on the condition that native Algerians be given the full rights of French citizens. In the years following the war, such gradualist reformers found themselves opposed by radical nationalists demanding complete independence. See also Ferhat Abbas; Association of Algerian Reformist ʿUlamāʾ; National Liberation Front.
