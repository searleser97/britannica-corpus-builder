Quintus Hortensius,  (flourished  3rd century bc), dictator of Rome in 287 who ended two centuries of “struggle between the orders” (the plebeians’ fight to gain political equality with patricians). When the plebeians, pressed by their patrician creditors, seceded to the Janiculan hill, Hortensius was appointed dictator to end the strife. He passed a law (the Lex Hortensia) whereby the resolutions of the plebeians (plebiscites) were made binding on all the citizens without requiring the approval of the Senate and so were equivalent to measures passed by the other assemblies. He is said to have died while still dictator.
