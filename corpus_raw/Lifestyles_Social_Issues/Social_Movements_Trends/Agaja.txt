Agaja, also spelled Agadja,  (born c. 1673—died  1740, Allada, Dahomey [now Benin]), third ruler of the West African kingdom of Dahomey (1708–40), who was able to extend his kingdom southward to the coast and who consolidated and centralized it through important administrative reforms.
The first part of Agaja’s reign was by far the more successful. From 1708 to 1727 he carried out a series of expansionist wars, culminating in the takeover of the kingdom of Allada in 1724 and of the important coastal trading state of Whydah (Ouïdah) in 1727. In the second half of his reign, however, he was subject to the invasions of the powerful Oyo kingdom to the northeast.
The Oyo first invaded Dahomey in 1726, easily defeating Agaja’s forces and burning his capital, Abomey, before returning home. They invaded Dahomey again in 1728, 1729, and 1730. Agaja and his men retreated or hid as the Oyo burned and pillaged. Finally, in 1730, Agaja was forced to come to terms and pay tribute. He also gave up his opposition to the slave trade, though he did insist on a royal monopoly. From 1730 until his death he maintained his capital at Allada, south of his former capital; once his territory seemed secure he concentrated on administrative reform, especially the creation of a bureaucracy under royal control. Internal dissension developed after 1735, however, partly because of the chiefs’ resentment over the royal monopoly of the slave trade, and in 1737 this trade became free. Meanwhile, Agaja was evidently not able to keep up the annual tribute to the Oyo, who invaded his kingdom once more the year before his death.
