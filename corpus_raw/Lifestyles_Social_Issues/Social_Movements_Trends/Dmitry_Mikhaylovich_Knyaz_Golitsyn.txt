Dmitry Mikhaylovich, Prince Golitsyn,  (born June 13 [June 3, old style], 1665, Russia—died April 25 [April 14, O.S.], 1737, St. Petersburg), Russian statesman who unsuccessfully tried to transform the Russian autocracy into a constitutional monarchy.
Having been sent to Italy in 1697 by Tsar Peter I the Great to study “military affairs,” Golitsyn was appointed commander of an auxiliary corps (1704) to fight the Swedes during the Great Northern War. He later entered civil government service and occupied the posts of governor general of Kiev (1715–19), senator (after 1719), and president of the Kamer-Kollegiya (Finance Ministry; 1719–22).
But Golitsyn was basically opposed to Peter’s reforms, which tended to undermine aristocratic privileges and place members of lower classes in powerful state offices; in 1724 he fell into disgrace and was deprived of all his public duties. Although Empress Catherine I (ruled 1725–27) restored him to his former status, he did not achieve a position of influence until after she died and her close adviser, Prince Aleksandr D. Menshikov, fell from power (1727). Golitsyn then became a member of the Supreme Privy Council (created in 1726), which in fact governed for Peter II (ruled 1727–30).
When Peter II died (1730), Golitsyn urged the Supreme Privy Council to offer the throne to Duchess Anna Ivanovna of Courland, a niece of Peter I, provided that she accept a set of “conditions” that he had composed, transferring many crucial prerogatives of the autocrat to the council. Anna signed the conditions at Mitau (Jelgava), but, when she arrived in Moscow and learned that the Imperial Guard opposed them, she tore them up and dissolved the Supreme Privy Council. Golitsyn then lived in retirement until 1736, when he was arrested and condemned to death, largely for his anti-autocratic political beliefs. Anna commuted his sentence to life imprisonment in the Schlisselburg fortress.
