Marian Langiewicz, in full Marian Melchior Langiewicz,  (born August 5, 1827, Krotoszyn, near Poznań, Poland, Prussia—died May 11, 1887, Constantinople, Ottoman Empire [now Istanbul, Turkey]), Polish soldier and patriot who played a key role in the Polish insurrection of 1863.
After a year in the Prussian army as a lieutenant of artillery, Langiewicz took a teaching position at the Polish military school in Paris (1860), but in the same year he joined Garibaldi’s Neapolitan campaign. In 1861 he taught at a short-lived Polish military school in Cuneo, in the Piedmont region of Italy.
Langiewicz joined in plans for a Polish insurrection against Russia in 1862, and, when it began in 1863, he headed a ragtag army in the Sandomierz (Sandomir) region of southern Poland. Because of Langiewicz’s early successes against Russian forces, conservative elements in the insurrection offered him dictatorship of the revolutionary regime in March, bypassing and hoping to check the more radical leadership in Warsaw. Langiewicz accepted the post and won partial recognition from the outmaneuvered Warsaw leaders. Within a few days, however, his forces suffered serious defeats against the Russians, which, along with factionalism among his troops, caused him to flee to Austria on March 21; his dictatorship thus ended after 10 days.
Langiewicz was imprisoned by the Austrians until 1865 and then lived in Switzerland for a while. Later he entered the service of the Ottoman Empire as Langie Bey. He wrote Relacya o kampanii własney 1863 r. (1905; “Report on My Campaign of 1863”) and Pisma wojskowe (1920; “Military Writings”).
