Aḥmad Shuqayrī, also spelled Shukairī, Shukairy, Shukeiry, or al-Shuqayrī,  (born 1908, Tabnīn, Lebanon—died February 26, 1980, Amman, Jordan), Palestinian nationalist who led the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) from 1964 to 1967.
The son of a noted religious scholar, Shuqayrī was born in Lebanon and returned to the family home in Acre, Palestine (now ʿAkko, Israel), when he was eight years old. After graduating from the American University of Beirut in Lebanon and the Jerusalem Law School, he practiced law for several years and became involved in the Palestinian nationalist movement. He fled Palestine following the aborted Palestine Arab Revolt (1936–39), returning only in the late 1940s, when he held several positions in the Palestinian civil administration. Shuqayrī fled the fighting of the Arab-Israeli War of 1948 and eventually took a position with the Arab League. He later became a delegate for both Syria and Saudi Arabia at the United Nations. As the PLO’s first president he was a leading spokesman for the Palestinian cause during the mid-1960s and was active as a propagandist and negotiator with Arab governments and international organizations. After the devastating Arab defeat by Israel in the Six-Day War of June 1967, there was a new militancy among Palestinian groups, and Shuqayrī was thought by some to be ineffectual. Accused of failure in coordinating the activities of Palestinian guerrilla groups, he resigned from the PLO’s top position—he was replaced by the youthful Yāsir ʿArafāt—and virtually disappeared from active political life.
