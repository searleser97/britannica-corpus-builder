Meiji, in full Meiji Tennō,  personal name Mutsuhito,  (born Nov. 3, 1852, Kyōto—died  July 30, 1912, Tokyo), emperor of Japan from 1867 to 1912, during whose reign Japan was dramatically transformed from a feudal country into one of the great powers of the modern world.
The second son of the emperor Kōmei, Mutsuhito was declared crown prince in 1860; following the death of his father in 1867, he was raised to the throne. In 1868 his coronation ceremony was carried out, and he took the name Meiji, by which the era of his reign is also known. Meiji’s accession to the throne coincided with the end of the Tokugawa shogunate and the restoration to the emperor of supreme executive authority in the country. Unlike Kōmei, he supported the growing popular consensus on the need for modernization of Japan along Western lines that had developed as a result of the country’s resumption of contact with other nations after a 250-year period of cultural and economic isolation. In 1868 Meiji took the “Charter Oath of Five Principles,” which launched Japan on the course of westernization. As emperor he formally ordered, though he did not initiate, the abolition of the feudal land system (1871), the creation of a new school system (1872), adoption of the cabinet system of government (1885), promulgation of the Meiji Constitution (1889), and opening of the Diet (1890). He played active roles in the prosecution of the Sino-Japanese War (1894–95) and the Russo-Japanese War (1904–05). In 1910 he issued an edict proclaiming the annexation of Korea to Japan.
Meiji himself epitomized the superimposition of Western ideas and innovations onto a base of Japanese culture; he wore Western clothes and ate Western-style food but also managed to compose 100,000 poems in the traditional Japanese style during his lifetime.
