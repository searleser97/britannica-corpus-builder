William FitzOsbert, byname Longbeard,  (died April 6, 1196, Smithfield, London, Eng.), English crusader and populist, a martyr for the poorer classes of London.
A London citizen of good family, FitzOsbert took part in the English expedition against the Muslims in Portugal (1190). On his return he made himself leader of the common people of London against the mayor and aldermen, rousing the mob by fiery speeches at St. Paul’s Cathedral and especially protesting against the assessment of the “aid” to pay Richard I’s ransom (1194). Though serving for a time as a member of the city council and claiming acquaintance with the king, he was regarded by his fellow magistrates as a dangerous demagogue, and they persuaded the justiciar Hubert Walter to seize him before he led an armed revolt in the city. He was taken from the sanctuary of St. Mary-le-Bow, Cheapside, to the Tower of London, sentenced to death, and hanged in chains at Smithfield, with nine followers, being at once revered as a martyr by the poorer classes.
