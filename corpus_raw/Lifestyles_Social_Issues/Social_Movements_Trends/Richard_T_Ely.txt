Richard T. Ely, in full Richard Theodore Ely,  (born April 13, 1854, Ripley, New York, U.S.—died October 4, 1943, Old Lyme, Connecticut), American economist who was noted for his belief that government, aided by economists, could help solve social problems.
Ely was educated at Columbia University, graduating in philosophy in 1876, and at the University of Heidelberg, where he received his Ph.D. in 1879. As a professor of political economy at Johns Hopkins University (1881–92), he advocated greater academic freedom and promoted a then-controversial account of the labour movement. This aroused enough indignation at Johns Hopkins to prompt his resignation. He then served as head of the department of economics at the University of Wisconsin (1892–1925).
Ely combined a strong political commitment with a belief in the need for an ethical approach to economics. Influenced by John Stuart Mill, who had emphasized the importance of institutional forces in directing distribution, Ely explored issues such as labour unrest, agricultural economics, and the problems of rural poverty.
Among the many civic organizations and institutions he founded or helped to create are the American Economic Association and the American Association for Labor Legislation. Ely’s belief in government solutions to people’s problems and his association with the progressive social programs sponsored by the state of Wisconsin made him one of the most influential American economists of his time. He wrote a highly successful textbook, Introduction to Political Economy (1889), as well as many other books and articles.
