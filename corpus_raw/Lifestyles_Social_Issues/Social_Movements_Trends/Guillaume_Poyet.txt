Guillaume Poyet,  (born c. 1473, Angers, Franceâ€”died  April 1548, Paris), chancellor of France (from 1538) who sought to reform legal procedures in France during the reign of Francis I.
After practicing successfully as a barrister at Angers and Paris, he was instructed by Louise of Savoy, mother of King Francis I, to uphold her rights against the constable Charles, Duke de Bourbon, in 1521. This was the beginning of his fortunes. Through the influence of the queen mother he obtained the posts of advocate general (1530) and president of the Parlement of Paris (1534) and became chancellor of France in 1538. He was responsible for the legal reform contained in the ordinance of Villers-Cotterets (1539), the object of which was to shorten procedure; it ordered the keeping of registers of baptisms and deaths and enjoined the exclusive use of the French language in legal procedure. With the constable Anne, Duke de Montmorency, he organized an intrigue to ruin Admiral Chabot and procured his condemnation in 1541; but after the admiral was pardoned, Poyet was himself thrown into prison, deprived of his offices, and sentenced to a fine of 100,000 livres. He recovered his liberty in 1545 and died in April 1548.
