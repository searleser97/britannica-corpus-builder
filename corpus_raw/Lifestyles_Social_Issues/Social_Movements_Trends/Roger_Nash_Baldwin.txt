Roger Nash Baldwin,  (born Jan. 21, 1884, Wellesley, Mass., U.S.—died  Aug. 26, 1981, Ridgewood, N.J.), American civil-rights activist, cofounder of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).
Born into an aristocratic Massachusetts family, Baldwin attended Harvard University (B.A., 1904; M.A., 1905). He then taught sociology at Washington University in St. Louis, Mo. (1906–09), and also served as chief probation officer of the city’s Juvenile Court (1907–10) and secretary of the reformist Civic League of St. Louis (1910–17). When the United States entered World War I, Baldwin became head of the pacifist American Union Against Militarism (predecessor of the ACLU), which defended draft resisters and conscientious objectors; in 1918–19 he spent nine months in jail for refusing to be drafted. Afterward, he wandered about for a year, joining the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) and finally ending up in New York City in 1920 to help found the ACLU. He was its director (1920–50) and then its national chairman (1950–55).
During Baldwin’s tenure as head of the ACLU, the organization acquired such diverse clients as teacher John T. Scopes in the 1925 Tennessee “Monkey Trial”; the Jehovah’s Witnesses, which won free-press rights in 1938; James Joyce, who had the ban lifted from his novel Ulysses; and Henry Ford, who was granted the right to distribute antiunion pamphlets. The ACLU defended persons of all persuasions, including radicals on the far left and on the far right.
In 1940 Baldwin became disenchanted with the communists and removed them from the ACLU’s board of directors. In the end he made civil rights a universal cause—a reversal of conditions in the 1920s and ’30s, when civil liberties were widely regarded suspiciously as a radical or leftist cause.
