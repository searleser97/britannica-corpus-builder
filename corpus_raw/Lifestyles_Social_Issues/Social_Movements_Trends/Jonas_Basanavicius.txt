Jonas Basanavičius,  Basanavičius also spelled Bassanowicz,  (born Nov. 23, 1851, Ožkabaliai, Lithuania, Russian Empire—died  Feb. 16, 1927, Vilnius, Lithuania), physician, folklorist, and a leader of the Lithuanian national movement.
In 1873 Basanavičius went to Moscow to study history and archaeology but after a year changed to medicine. He was graduated in 1879 and spent most of the next 25 years practicing medicine in Bulgaria. He edited the first number of the important Lithuanian cultural and political magazine Aušra (“Dawn”), published 1883–86; it was printed in East Prussia and had to be smuggled into Lithuania because of the tsarist regime’s ban on the printing of Lithuanian in the Latin alphabet. Aušra significantly influenced the development of the Lithuanian national movement.
From 1905 Basanavičius lived in Vilnius. Considered to be the moral president of the nation, he was chairman of the Great Assembly in Vilnius that in 1905 demanded autonomy for Lithuania; in 1917 he was president of the conference that elected him to the Lietuvos Taryba (Council of Lithuania), which on Feb. 16, 1918, proclaimed Lithuanian independence. Basanavičius’ founding of the Lithuanian Scientific Society in 1907 was an outstanding contribution to Lithuanian learning. For 20 years he was president of the society, editor of its journal, and organizer of research in archaeology and folklore. His many publications are largely collections of Lithuanian folklore. He also wrote several studies expounding his hypothesis that the Lithuanians were descendants of the Thraco-Phrygians.
