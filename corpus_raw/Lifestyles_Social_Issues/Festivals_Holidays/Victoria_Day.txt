Victoria Day,  Canadian holiday on which the British sovereign’s birthday is celebrated. In 1845, during the reign of Queen Victoria, May 24, the queen’s birthday, was declared a holiday in Canada. After Victoria’s death in 1901, an act of the Canadian Parliament established Victoria Day as a legal holiday, to be celebrated on May 24 (or on May 25 when May 24 fell on a Sunday). The birthday of Victoria’s son, Edward VII (born November 9), was also celebrated on Victoria Day, following an intermittent British custom of celebrating a sovereign’s birthday on that of his predecessor.
This custom was not observed in Canada for the birthdays of George V (reigned 1910–36) or Edward VIII (reigned 1936), when the actual day was celebrated, or for that of George VI, whose birthday was celebrated in June though he was born on December 14. In 1952 the first birthday of Queen Elizabeth II as sovereign was celebrated in June (she was born on April 21). Canada had also continued to celebrate Victoria Day, moving it officially to the Monday preceding May 24 in 1952; thereafter Elizabeth’s birthday was celebrated on Victoria Day, a custom made permanent in 1957.
