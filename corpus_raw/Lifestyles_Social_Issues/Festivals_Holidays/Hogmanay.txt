Hogmanay,  New Year’s festival in Scotland and parts of northern England. The name is also used for the dole of bread, cake, or sweets then given to the children who go from house to house soliciting it with traditional rhymes, one of which concludes with “Rise up and gie’s our Hogmanay.” On this evening also it is traditional for parties of masked children or young men to visit houses as guisers or mummers. Of local customs formerly observed at Hogmanay, the “burning of the clavie” (a bonfire of split casks, in which a nail plays a part) still flourishes at Burghead in Moray. The derivation of the term is doubtful.
