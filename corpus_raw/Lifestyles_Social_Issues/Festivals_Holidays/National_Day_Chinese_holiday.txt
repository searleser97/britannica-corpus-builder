National Day,  holiday celebrated on October 1 to mark the formation of the People’s Republic of China. The holiday is also celebrated by China’s two special administrative regions: Hong Kong and Macau. Traditionally, the festivities begin with the ceremonial raising of the Chinese national flag in Tiananmen Square in the capital city of Beijing. The flag ceremony is followed first by a large parade exhibiting the country’s military forces and then by state dinners and, finally, fireworks displays, which conclude the evening celebrations. In 1999 the Chinese government expanded the celebrations by several days to give its citizens a seven-day vacation period similar to the Golden Week holiday in Japan. Often, the Chinese use this time to stay with relatives and to travel. Visiting amusement parks and watching special television programs centred on the holiday are also popular activities. National Day is celebrated on Friday, October 1, 2021 in China.
On October 1, 1949, Mao Zedong, the leader of the Red Army (communist forces), officially declared the formation of the People’s Republic of China before a crowd of 300,000 in Tiananmen Square while waving the newly created Chinese flag. The declaration followed a civil war in which communist forces emerged victorious over the Nationalist government. On December 2, 1949, at a meeting of the Central People’s Government Council, the declaration to formally adopt October 1 as National Day was ratified by the First National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference.
