Buy Nothing Day,  day of protest in which participants pledge to buy nothing for 24 hours to raise awareness of the negative environmental, social, and political consequences of overconsumption. Conceived of in 1992 by Canadian artist Ted Dave, it is typically observed in North America on the Friday following Thanksgiving Day in the United States, which is one of the busiest shopping days of the year. Asia, Europe, South America, and Australia have also seen the appearance of Buy Nothing Day campaigns. 
The anticorporate political magazine Adbusters and its founder, Kalle Lasn, played a large role in organizing and promoting Buy Nothing Day.
