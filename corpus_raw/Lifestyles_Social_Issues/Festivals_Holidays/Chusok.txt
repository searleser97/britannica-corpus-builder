Ch’usŏk, also known as Chungch’ujŏl, Kabae, or Hangawi,  Korean holiday celebrated on the 15th day of the 8th lunar month to commemorate the fall harvest and to honour one’s ancestors. Similar to Thanksgiving Day in the United States, the Harvest Moon Festival, as it is also known, is one of the most popular holidays in Korea. The day begins with a ceremony in which food and wine are offered to ancestors. This is followed by a meal that typically consists of fish and newly harvested vegetables and grains. The food most associated with the holiday is songpyon, a crescent-shaped rice cake that is cooked on a bed of pine needles. Later in the day celebrants visit the graves of relatives, where more ceremonies are performed. Ch’usŏk is also marked by gift giving and athletic events, including tug-of-war competitions, archery contests, and sirrum (Korean wrestling) matches. Other activities include dancing and music playing, and on Ch’usŏk many Koreans wear traditional clothing (hanbok). Ch'usŏk is celebrated on Monday, September 20, 2021.
