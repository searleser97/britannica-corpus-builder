Revolution Day,  public holiday celebrated in Egypt to commemorate the military coup of July 23, 1952, that led to the end of the monarchy and the establishment of a republic.
The coup was carried out by a clandestine group called the Free Officers, led by Gen. Muḥammad Naguib. The group of former army officers had been established by Gamal Abdel Nasser in 1949 to plan a coup against the government of King Farouk. They successfully overthrew the king in 1952 and installed a more democratic government noted for the institution of major land reforms that sought to recover the lands held by the country’s elite and redistribute them among the poor, the acceleration of industrialization in the country, a somewhat successful campaign against corruption, and the advancement of women’s rights, including the right to vote.
To officially honour the day, the Egyptian president issues a public statement praising the revolution, and there is a celebration staged by the minister of defense.
