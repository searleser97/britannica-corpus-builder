Jamhuri Day, also called Independence Day,  one of the most important national holidays in Kenya, observed on December 12. The holiday formally marks the date of the country’s admittance in 1964 into the Commonwealth as a republic and takes its name from the Swahili word jamhuri (“republic”); December 12 is also the date when Kenya obtained its independence from Great Britain in 1963.
Under British rule since the late 19th century, Kenya officially became a British colony in 1920. The colonial administration opposed African demands for a greater role in the political process, and it was not until 1944 that an African was included in the colony’s legislature. Disputes over land and cultural traditions continued, however, and the movement against colonial rule grew, culminating in the Mau Mau uprisings in the 1950s, during which the country was plunged into a state of emergency through most of the decade. Africans gained some social and economic concessions as a result of the uprisings, and African political participation increased in the early 1960s. Kenya gained independence on Dec. 12, 1963, and became a republic a year later, with Jomo Kenyatta as its president.
Because Jamhuri Day has such historical significance, virtually every Kenyan celebrates the holiday to some extent. Celebrations include feasts, political speeches, parades, and dancing.
