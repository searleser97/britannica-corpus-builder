Fête Nationale du Québec, (French:  “Quebec National Holiday”) also called Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day,  official holiday of Quebec, Canada. Observed on June 24, the holiday marks the summer solstice and honours the patron saint of French Canadians—Jean Baptiste, or John the Baptist.
Québécois begin their celebration of the occasion the night before, with bonfires, dancing, and the singing of traditional folk songs. The morning of the holiday, parades are held in major centres. A Roman Catholic mass is usually occasioned for the holiday and is followed by popular music concerts by local, national, and international artists. French Canadians living outside Quebec also celebrate the holiday, leading many non-French Canadians living in Quebec to consider it an ethnic holiday instead of a provincial holiday.
In 1636 French Canadians revived an ancient Gallic tradition in honour of the summer solstice by lighting bonfires. The annual pagan event was eventually combined with a celebration for the feast of St. John the Baptist led by the national society of French Canadians, the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society. This society was founded in 1834 with the name the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Association (changed to the modern form in 1914). In 1977 then-premier of Quebec René Lévesque officially recognized the day as a national holiday in the province.
