National Hispanic Heritage Month,  month (September 15–October 15) in which the people of the United States honour the achievements of Hispanics. The celebration was first authorized in 1968, when the U.S. Congress adopted a resolution asking the president of the United States annually to issue a proclamation designating a week in September including September 15 and 16 as “National Hispanic Heritage Week.” In 1988 Congress expanded the celebration to a 31-day period beginning September 15. The resolution calls “on the people of the United States, especially the educational community, to observe National Hispanic Heritage Month with appropriate ceremonies and activities.” Hispanic Heritage Month coincides with the celebrations of Independence Day in many Latin American countries—including Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua (September 15), Mexico (September 16), and Chile (September 18)—as well as with Columbus Day (originally October 12 in the United States but now commemorated there on the second Monday in October).
