Heritage Day,  Canadian holiday celebrating the country’s history and architecture. Heritage Day is not an official national holiday, though it is widely recognized throughout Canada. For most of Canada’s provinces, Heritage Day is celebrated on the third Monday in February, however, there are some notable exceptions: in Alberta, it occurs on the first Monday of August; in Yukon, the Friday before the last Sunday in February; and in Saskatchewan, February 17.
Heritage Day was created in 1973 by the Heritage Canada Foundation to preserve and promote Canada’s natural, architectural, and historical heritage. Each year the Heritage Canada Foundation chooses a different theme for the Heritage Day celebrations. For example, in 2001 the theme was transportation, highlighting notable structures related to rail, steam engine, and motor car transportation. In 2005 the theme was faith, and the foundation identified famous churches, temples, mosques, and prayer houses around the country.
