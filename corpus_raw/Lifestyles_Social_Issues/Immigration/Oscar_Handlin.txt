Oscar Handlin,  (born September 29, 1915, Brooklyn, New York, U.S.—died September 20, 2011, Cambridge, Massachusetts), American historian and educator noted for his examinations of immigration and other social topics in American history.
The son of Jewish immigrant parents, Handlin graduated from Brooklyn College in 1934 and earned his M.A. degree from Harvard University in 1935. He then taught history at Brooklyn College (1936–38) and joined the history faculty at Harvard in 1939. He received his doctorate from Harvard in 1940. After holding several prestigious professorships, he served as director of the Harvard University Library from 1979 to 1985.
Handlin’s doctoral thesis, published in modified form as Boston’s Immigrants, 1790–1865 (1941), was a study of the acculturation of Irish immigrants to that city. Handlin’s most important historical study, The Uprooted (1951), told the story of the great waves of immigration that formed the American people, and it examined the psychological and cultural adjustments that people had to make after settling in the United States. The book’s combination of literary style, acute scholarship, and humane reportage typified Handlin’s approach to the writing of social history. The Uprooted won a Pulitzer Prize.
Handlin went on to write about many other aspects of American history. Among these works are Race and Nationality in American Life (1956), Fire-Bell in the Night (1964), Facing Life (1971; with Mary F. Handlin), Truth in History (1979), and Liberty in America, 1600 to the Present (multivolume set beginning 1986; cowritten with his second wife, Lilian Handlin).
