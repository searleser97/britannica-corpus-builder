Sir John Hope Simpson,  (born July 23, 1868, Liverpool—died  April 10, 1961), British civil administrator in India and author of two of the earliest modern studies on refugees.
Simpson held numerous governmental posts before his retirement in 1916, rising to the post of acting chief commander of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. He then worked with refugee and relief services in China and Greece, for which he received high honours, including that of Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1937. Simpson’s books The Refugee Problem: Report of a Survey (1939) and Refugees: A Review of the Situation Since September 1938 (1939) remain prime sources of information on most aspects of the refugee situation during the early 20th century.
