Nansen International Office for Refugees, ,  international office opened by the League of Nations in 1931 to complete the work of Fridtjof Nansen, who had been the League of Nationsâ€™ high commissioner for refugees from 1921 until his death in 1930. The organization was given a mandate to solve the refugee problem in eight years, but the rise of Nazism in Germany in 1933 increased the number of refugees and made it necessary to establish a separate office in London; the new office was named the High Commission for Refugees Coming from Germany. In 1939 the latter group combined with the Nansen Office to form the Office of the High Commissioner for All Refugees under League of Nations Protection. Although unable to end the refugee problem on its own, the Nansen International Office for Refugees was awarded the 1938 Nobel Prize for Peace in recognition of its efforts and its display of worldwide humanitarianism.
In its eight-year tenure, the Nansen Office reportedly reduced the number of refugees from more than 1,000,000 to under 500,000. Its methods of helping refugees included both material and administrative assistance; the office gave loans to promote self-help and assisted refugees in securing documents such as work and residence permits. Another service of the office was to protect refugees from expulsion and other such injustices. In total, the Nansen Office intervened in more than 800,000 cases. Its successor, the Office of the High Commissioner for All Refugees under League of Nations Protection (now the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees), has successfully carried on the work. It too was recognized by the Nobel Committee, winning the Prize for Peace in both 1955 and 1981.
