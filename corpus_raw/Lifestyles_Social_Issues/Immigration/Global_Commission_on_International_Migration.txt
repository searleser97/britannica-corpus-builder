Global Commission on International Migration (GCIM),  organization established in December 2003 to promote global discussion and cooperation on issues related to the international movement of persons. Formed by then United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the governments of 19 UN member states, the GCIM was charged with bringing the issue of migration to the forefront of the global agenda, analyzing migration regulations to identify shortcomings, and proposing ways to improve migration.
The GCIM began its work in January 2004. Numerous regional hearings to study global migration were organized; the first of these hearings was held in Manila on May 17–18, 2004. Six working panels discussed specific issues such as migrants in the labour market, economic growth and development, migration patterns and human rights, migrants’ role in society, and national, regional, and international governance. The final report of the GCIM, submitted to the United Nations on Dec. 3, 2005, presented principles for action and related recommendations to improve the governance of international migration. In 2006 the Independent Global Commission on International Migration and the Geneva Migration Group were established to continue the work of the GCIM.
