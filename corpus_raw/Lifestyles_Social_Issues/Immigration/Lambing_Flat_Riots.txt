Lambing Flat Riots,  (1860–61), wave of anti-Chinese disturbances in the goldfields of New South Wales, Australia, which led to restriction of Chinese immigration. Many white and Chinese miners had flocked to the settlement of Lambing Flat (now called Young) when gold was discovered in the area in the summer of 1860. The first disturbance grew out of a demonstration organized by a white miners’ vigilance committee against gambling dens and other alleged vice on December 12, 1860. After venting their rage on these establishments, the miners attacked the Chinese quarter of the settlement, killed several people, and wounded many others. Other attacks followed the December incident, and eventually the Chinese miners had to abandon the fields. While the white miners justified their brutality by claiming that the Chinese were squandering the water supply so vital to alluvial prospecting, racism was probably an equally significant factor.
A military detachment restored order at the flat from March until June 1861, and most of the Chinese returned to the settlement. Soon after the departure of the troops, however, a final, devastating riot occurred on June 30. Several thousand miners descended on the Chinese, plundering their dwellings; mounted pursuers overtook the fleeing Chinese and degraded, beat, and robbed them. The authorities returned quickly and restored order. The Lambing Flat Riots led the New South Wales government to pass the Chinese Immigration Act in November 1861, severely limiting the flow of Chinese into the colony.
