Emily Greene Balch,  (born January 8, 1867, Jamaica Plain [now part of Boston], Mass., U.S.—died January 9, 1961, Cambridge, Mass.), American sociologist, political scientist, economist, and pacifist, a leader of the women’s movement for peace during and after World War I. She received the Nobel Prize for Peace in 1946 jointly with John Raleigh Mott. She was also noted for her sympathetic and thorough study of Slavic immigrants in the United States.
Balch was in the first class to graduate from Bryn Mawr College, in 1889. She pursued further studies in Paris and Berlin and at the University of Chicago and received training in social work from followers of Jacob Riis in New York City and at Denison House, a settlement house in Boston, where she was associated with Vida Scudder. In 1896 she began her teaching career at Wellesley College, becoming in 1913 professor of political economy and political and social science.
Balch continued her interest in the settlement house movement, working with Jane Addams’s Hull House in Chicago. She was active in promoting various child-welfare reforms and served on Massachusetts commissions on industrial education (1908–09) and immigration (1913–14) and on the Boston city planning board (1914–17). To prepare Our Slavic Fellow Citizens (1910), a study of Slavic immigrants, she lived in Slavic-American neighbourhoods in various cities and traveled to eastern Europe for firsthand knowledge of the Slavic homelands. A member of the Society of Friends, Balch became increasingly committed to the cause of peace and, following her attendance at the International Congress of Women at The Hague in 1915, she devoted her major efforts to that cause. For opposing U.S. entry into World War I, she was dismissed from her professorship at Wellesley in 1918. She helped Addams found the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF) in Zürich, Switzerland, the following year and served as its secretary until 1922, when ill health forced her resignation; she resumed the post briefly in 1934–35 and in 1936 was elected honorary international president.
In 1926 Balch was part of an informal commission organized to study conditions in Haiti, and the committee’s report, Occupied Haiti (1927), of which she was the principal author, was credited with hastening the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the country. Balch gave her portion of the 1946 Nobel Prize for Peace to the WILPF. Among her other writings are Outline of Economics (1899), A Study of Conditions of City Life (1903), Approaches to the Great Settlement (1918), Refugees as Assets (1939), One Europe (1947), Vignettes in Prose (1952), and Toward Human Unity, or Beyond Nationalism (1952).
