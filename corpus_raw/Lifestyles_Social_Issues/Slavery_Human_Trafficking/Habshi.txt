Ḥabshī,  African and Abyssinian slaves in pre-British India. The name derives from the Arabic word Ḥabashī (“Abyssinian”), through its Persian form. Such slaves, frequently employed by the chiefs of Muslim India, especially in the Deccan, were believed to have great physical prowess and ability and a lack of personal ties, which promoted loyalty.
Many Ḥabshī rose to high office and some became independent. The most famous of them was Malik ʿAmbar of Ahmadnagar, who defied the Mughals for many years. Ḥabshī in western India, the Sidis of Janjira, commanded the fleet of the Bijapur sultan and became independent chiefs. They defied the Marathas and in 1670 transferred their allegiance to the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. They accepted British supremacy and maintained their state until 1948, when it was integrated with the Bombay state of the new Indian union.
