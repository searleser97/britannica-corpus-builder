Crittenden Compromise,   (1860–61), in U.S. history, series of measures intended to forestall the American Civil War, futilely proposed in Congress by Senator John J. Crittenden of Kentucky in December 1860. He envisioned six constitutional amendments by which the Missouri Compromise of 1820 was, in effect, to be reenacted and, more important, to be extended to the Pacific; the federal government was to indemnify owners of fugitive slaves whose return was prevented by antislavery elements in the North; “squatter sovereignty” (the right to decide if slavery should exist or not) in the territories was to be sanctioned; and slavery in the District of Columbia was to be protected from congressional action. On March 2, 1861, Crittenden’s plan was narrowly defeated in the Senate. Two months earlier, Crittenden had introduced a resolution calling for a national referendum on these proposals, but the Senate never acted on this resolution.
