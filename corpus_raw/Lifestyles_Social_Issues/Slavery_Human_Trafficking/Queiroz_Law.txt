Queiroz Law,   (1850), measure enacted by the Brazilian parliament to make the slave trade illegal. In the mid-19th century the British government put pressure on Brazil to put an end to traffic in West African slaves, 150,000 of whom had arrived in Brazil in 1847â€“49. The government of the Brazilian emperor Pedro II, while not in favour of the slave trade, resented what it viewed as high-handed British methods to halt it. The Brazilian parliament ended the slave trade in 1850, after British warships had seized some slave ships in Brazilian harbours. Slavery within Brazil, however, was not abolished until 1888. See also Rio Branco Law.
