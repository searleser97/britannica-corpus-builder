John Albion Andrew,   (born May 31, 1818, Windham, Maine, U.S.—died  Oct. 30, 1867, Boston), U.S. antislavery leader who, as governor of Massachusetts during the Civil War, was one of the most energetic of the Northern “war governors.”
Andrew entered political life as a Whig opposed to the Mexican War (1846–48). In 1848 he joined the Free-Soil movement against the spread of slavery. After the passage of the Kansas–Nebraska Act (1854), which permitted those territories to choose between slavery and freedom, he helped organize the Republican Party in Massachusetts. In 1859 he defended the abolitionist John Brown so vigorously that he was summoned to Washington to appear before an investigating committee of the Senate. In 1860 he led the Massachusetts delegation at the Republican convention at Chicago, which nominated Lincoln for the presidency; from 1861 to January 1866 he was governor of Massachusetts.
