Francis Henry Underwood,  (born Jan. 12, 1825, Enfield, Mass., U.S.â€”died  Aug. 7, 1894, Edinburgh), American author and lawyer who became a founder of The Atlantic Monthly in order to further the antislavery cause.
Following a year at Amherst (Mass.) College, Underwood went to Kentucky where he studied law. There his strong aversion to slavery was heightened by close observation. In 1850 he returned to Massachusetts and, after three years of political work, joined the publishing house of Phillips, Sampson and Company as assistant editor. The antislavery atmosphere of the northeast led him to the idea of publishing a literary magazine to oppose slavery. By 1857, after several years of editorial experience, he had gained the support of such liberal writers as Harriet Beecher Stowe, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and James Russell Lowell and persuaded his firm to publish a magazine. Edited by Lowell, with Underwood as assistant editor, The Atlantic Monthly began publication in November 1857. Underwood left the magazine in 1859 after it was purchased by another firm, resuming his political activity and writing the biographies of Lowell, Longfellow, and the poet and reformer John Greenleaf Whittier, as well as several short stories and novels. His best known book is Quabbin: The Story of a Small Town (1893), an account of his boyhood in Enfield. At his death he was U.S. consul in Scotland.
