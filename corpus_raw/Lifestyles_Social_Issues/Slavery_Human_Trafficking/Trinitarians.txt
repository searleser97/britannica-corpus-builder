Trinitarian, member of Order of the Most Holy Trinity for the Redemption of Captives (O.SS.T.),  a Roman Catholic order of men founded in France in 1198 by St. John of Matha to free Christian slaves from captivity under the Muslims in the Middle East, North Africa, and Spain. St. Felix of Valois has been traditionally considered as cofounder, but recent critics have questioned his existence. The order had its own rule, distinguished for its austerity, and devoted one-third of its possessions and revenues to the liberation of slaves. No accurate figure for the number of captives ransomed can be given, but it has been estimated that the total was as high as 140,000. Because slavery is no longer an international problem, the order now devotes itself to teaching, giving missions, and serving in parishes, hospitals, and prisons. The order is said to have numbered 5,000 members in 1240, but, by the end of the Middle Ages, a decline had set in, and various reforms were attempted during the 16th century. In 1597 a reform called the Barefooted (Discalced) Trinitarians was initiated in Spain by Juan Bautista of the Immaculate Conception; this became a distinct order and is the only surviving branch of the Trinitarians.
