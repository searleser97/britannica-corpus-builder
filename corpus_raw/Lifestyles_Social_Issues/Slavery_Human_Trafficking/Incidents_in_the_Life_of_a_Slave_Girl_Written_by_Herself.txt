Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, Written by Herself,  autobiographical narrative by Harriet Jacobs, a former North Carolina slave, published in 1861.
Jacobs’s narrator and alter ego, Linda Brent, is a woman of mixed descent owned by sadistic Dr. Flint, a pious churchgoer who repeatedly beats and rapes Linda and also sells her children. Her narrative includes graphic descriptions of brutality, slave auctions, and the cruelty of slave owners’ wives to their husbands’ slave children. Written after Jacobs’s own escape to freedom, the book derives its power from the unflinching accuracy of its portrayal of the lives of the slaves.
