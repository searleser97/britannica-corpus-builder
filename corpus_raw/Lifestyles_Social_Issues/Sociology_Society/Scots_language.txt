Scots language, also called Lowland Scots,  historic language of the people of Lowland Scotland and one closely related to English. The word Lallans, which was originated by the Scottish poet Robert Burns, is usually used for a literary variety of the language, especially that used by the writers of the mid-20th-century movement known as the Scottish Renaissance.
Scots is directly descended from Northern English, which displaced Scots Gaelic in portions of Scotland in the 11th–14th centuries as a consequence of Anglo-Norman rule there. By the early 14th century, Northern English had become the spoken tongue of many Scottish people east and south of the Highlands (with Scots Gaelic continuing to be used in the southwest). Sometime in the late 15th century, the spoken language became known as “Scottis,” or Scots, a term that was used interchangeably with “Inglis” for some time thereafter. Over the next two centuries the former diverged from Northern English in pronunciation and also in vocabulary, particularly in additions from French, Dutch, Latin, and Gaelic. The earliest written records in Scots date from the late 14th century, and by the 16th century it had supplanted Latin as the principal literary and record-keeping language in the kingdom. Scots was steadily Anglicized from the mid-16th century onward as a result of the cultural, economic, and political dominance of England. It is phonologically distinguished by stronger r’s, shortened vowels, and simplified diphthongs. See also Scottish literature.
