Council on Foreign Relations (CFR),  independent nonpartisan think tank and publisher that promotes understanding of international relations and foreign policy. The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) was founded in 1921. It does not take policy positions but instead sponsors discussion, analysis, and research. It also publishes the journal Foreign Affairs, a leading forum for discussion of events that affect global affairs. Headquarters are in New York City.
The CFR includes government officials, activists, scholars, business leaders, journalists, and professionals from corporations and nonprofit groups. Members of the council interact directly with high government officials, academic experts, and policy makers in CFR-sponsored panel discussions, workshops, symposia, town halls, and other fora. Membership in the council is available to U.S. citizens who have been nominated by a current member. Life members, whose nominations must be seconded by at least three other persons (preferably CFR members), are elected biannually by the CFR’s board of directors, which seeks to include members of diverse backgrounds and political philosophies. Term members, whose nominations require at least two seconds, serve five-year membership terms and are chosen annually from among applicants 30 to 36 years old. Corporate members are included through the group’s corporate membership program. The CFR also includes the David Rockefeller Studies Program, a think tank made up of adjunct and full-time fellows and scholars as well as resident fellows who contribute to the foreign-affairs discussion through various publications. The CFR is funded by private and institutional donations.
