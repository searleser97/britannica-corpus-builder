Māori language, Māori te reo Māori,  Eastern Polynesian subgroup of the Eastern Austronesian (Oceanic) languages, spoken in the Cook Islands and New Zealand. Since the Māori Language Act of 1987, it has been one of the two official languages of New Zealand. Estimates of the number of Māori speakers range from 100,000 to 150,000.
As one of the marginal eastern Polynesian islands, New Zealand was one of the last of the Polynesian islands to be settled (about 800 ce). Since that time the Māori language (te reo Māori) has developed independently of other Polynesian languages. European Christian missionaries developed Māori as a written language, and the first printed material in the Māori language was published in 1815.
The language contains five vowels (each of which can be either short or long) and 10 consonants (h, k, m, n, ng, p, r, t, w, and wh). Reduplication is frequently used, generally as a modification of intensity. Prefixes and suffixes are relatively rare, and the plurality of nouns and verb tenses is usually indicated by the syntax of a statement.
