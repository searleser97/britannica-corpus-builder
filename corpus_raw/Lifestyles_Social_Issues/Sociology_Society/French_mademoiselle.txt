Mademoiselle, abbreviation Mlle,  the French equivalent of “Miss,” referring to an unmarried female. Etymologically, it means “my (young) lady” (ma demoiselle).
As an honorific title in the French royal court, it came to be used (without the adjunction of a proper name) to refer to or address the daughter of the king’s eldest living brother, who was himself called monsieur. The first to be called mademoiselle was Anne-Marie-Louise d’Orléans, duchesse de Montpensier, popularly called La Grande Mademoiselle, who was the daughter of Gaston, duc d’Orléans (brother of Louis XIII). A later mademoiselle was Marie-Louise d’Orléans, daughter of Philippe I, duc d’Orleans (brother of Louis XIV), who became queen of Spain as the wife of Charles II.
The use of the title in public and private business persisted into the 21st century, and French women were required to identify themselves as married (madame) or unmarried (mademoiselle). No equivalent distinction existed for men, with appellation monsieur used universally. In 2012, after years of campaigning by feminist groups, the French government announced that it would phase out the use of mademoiselle in favour of madame in official documents, and it encouraged private businesses to follow its lead.
