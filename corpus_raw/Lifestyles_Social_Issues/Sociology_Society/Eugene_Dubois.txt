Eugène Dubois, in full Marie Eugène François Thomas Dubois,  (born January 28, 1858, Eisden, Netherlands—died December 16, 1940, de Bedlaer), Dutch anatomist and geologist who discovered the remains of Java man, the first known fossil of Homo erectus.
Appointed lecturer in anatomy at the University of Amsterdam (1886), Dubois investigated the comparative anatomy of the larynx in vertebrates but became increasingly interested in human evolution. In 1887 he went to the East Indies as a military surgeon and, on the island of Sumatra, began to excavate caves in search of remains of early hominins (members of the human lineage).
Continuing his quest on the island of Java, Dubois found at Trinil a jaw fragment (1890) and later a skullcap and thighbone. The skull gave evidence of a small brain, massive browridges, a flat, retreating forehead, and other apelike features. Dubois named the fossils Pithecanthropus erectus, or “upright ape-man,” to indicate an intermediate phase in the evolution then believed to proceed from simian ancestors having the upright posture characteristic of modern man. After publishing his findings (1894) he returned to Europe (1895) and became a professor of geology at the University of Amsterdam. Because of controversy surrounding his discovery, he withdrew his materials from all examination until 1923.
