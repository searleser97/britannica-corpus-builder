American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA),  American political organization that worked from 1869 to 1890 to gain for women the right to vote.
Based in Boston, Massachusetts, the AWSA was created by Lucy Stone, Henry B. Blackwell, Julia Ward Howe, T.W. Higginson, and others when two factions of the woman suffrage movement split on the issues of tactics, philosophy, and even goals. Considered the more conservative organization, the AWSA encouraged male officers, supported the Republican Party, sought simple enfranchisement, and counted the abolitionists among its ranks. Its members also believed in the necessity of organizing on the state and local levels. To that end, they drafted a constitution that called for a focus on achieving the vote for women. Concentrating on organizing the state and local levels, the AWSA encouraged auxiliary state societies to be formed and provided an effective grassroots system for the dissemination of information about the woman suffrage movement. After more than two decades of independent operation, the AWSA merged with the more radical National Woman Suffrage Association to form the National American Woman Suffrage Association.
