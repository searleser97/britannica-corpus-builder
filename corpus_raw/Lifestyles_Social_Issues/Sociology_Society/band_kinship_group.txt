Band,  in anthropology, a notional type of human social organization consisting of a small number of people (usually no more than 30 to 50 persons in all) who form a fluid, egalitarian community and cooperate in activities such as subsistence, security, ritual, and care for children and elders.
The term band has precursors in a variety of European languages; it was initially used to describe a group of people who shared a bond. Among 19th-century anthropologists, geographers, and explorers, the “band-level society” was designated as the initial stage in models of unilineal cultural evolution and was most often used to describe hunting and gathering cultures. The term was used in this evolutionary sense until the mid-20th century.
Although unilineal cultural evolution has since been discredited as a model of societal development, band continues to be used in college courses, documentaries, and popular reference works as a sort of technical shorthand denoting a group’s size and degree of social hierarchy.
