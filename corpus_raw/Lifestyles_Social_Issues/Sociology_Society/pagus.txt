Pagus, plural pagi,  among ancient Germanic peoples, a village community usually formed by a band of related people who would also form a military unit in tribal wars. A loose confederation of such groups formed the larger tribes. In medieval Europe the word came to denote a basic unit of land. It survives in the modern French pays and Italian paese, both meaning “country” or “district.”
