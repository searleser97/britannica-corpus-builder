Straus family,  Jewish American immigrant family whose members prospered as owners of Macy’s department store in New York City and distinguished themselves in public service and philanthropy. The Straus family originated in Otterberg, Bavaria (Germany), from which Lazarus Straus, the patriarch, immigrated to the United States in 1852. He settled at Talbotton, Georgia, where he was joined by his wife and three sons, Isidor, Nathan, and Oscar Solomon.
During the American Civil War the family aided the Confederacy, but, following its defeat, they resettled in New York City. There they established the merchandising firm L. Straus and Sons. In 1888 Isidor and Nathan acquired a percentage of R.H. Macy and Company, and by 1896 they had gained full ownership of the department store. Isidor served for a short time in the U.S. House of Representatives (1894–95) and in later years engaged in philanthropic works. He and his wife, Ida, perished aboard the ocean liner Titanic in 1912. (Although offered a seat in a lifeboat, Isidor refused to disobey the order of women and children first. Ida, in turn, would not leave her husband, reportedly saying, “Where you go, I go.”) Their son Jesse Isidor Straus became president of Macy’s in 1919 and was succeeded in that office by his son Jack Isidor Straus, who served as company president from 1939 to 1956.
Nathan Straus gained distinction for his philanthropic efforts to improve the health and nutrition of needy children. His brother Oscar Solomon was the first Jewish member of a U.S. cabinet and represented the United States in Turkey under three administrations.
