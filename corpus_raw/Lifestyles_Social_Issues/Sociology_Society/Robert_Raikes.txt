Robert Raikes,   (born Sept. 14, 1735, Gloucester, Gloucestershire, Eng.—died  April 5, 1811, Gloucester), British journalist, philanthropist, and pioneer of the Sunday-school movement. His philanthropic work began with a concern with prison reform.
The son of a printer and newspaper publisher (the Gloucester Journal), Raikes succeeded to his father’s business in 1757. He joined in such humanitarian causes as prison reform and hospital care. Noting the unsupervised behaviour of Gloucester children on Sundays, Raikes engaged in 1780 a number of women to teach reading and the church catechism on Sundays. The experiment was so successful that he could record in the Gloucester Journal (Nov. 3, 1783) that the district had become “quite a heaven upon Sundays.” The Sunday-school movement spread rapidly to all parts of the country. In 1785 the Sunday School Society was formed. The Sunday School Union (1803) was a direct result of Raikes’s work.
