Peter A.B. Widener, in full Peter Arrell Brown Widener,  (born Nov. 13, 1834, Philadelphia, Pa., U.S.—died  Nov. 6, 1915, Elkins Park, Pa.), American transportation magnate and philanthropist.
The son of poor parents, Widener began his working career as a butcher, eventually establishing a successful chain of meat stores. At the same time, he became active in Philadelphia politics, rising to the position of city treasurer in 1873. Later, making good use of his political connections, he and William L. Elkins gained control of Philadelphia’s street railways, consolidating and modernizing the system in the process. They also invested in street railways in New York City, Chicago, and other cities as well as in public utilities around the United States—at their height presiding over holdings worth $1,500,000,000. Widener also participated in the organization of the United States Steel Corporation and the American Tobacco Company.
The possessor of a fortune estimated at $35,000,000, Widener donated more than $11,000,000 to various philanthropies, primarily in Philadelphia. His large art collection, which contained many masterpieces of European painting and a remarkable assemblage of Chinese porcelains and other decorative objects, was donated to the National Gallery, Washington, D.C., in 1942.
