Ceṭṭi,   group of castes widespread in southern India, roughly corresponding to the Banias, a similar group of merchant castes in the north. They specialize primarily in the mercantile trades, as bankers, moneylenders, pawnbrokers, shopkeepers, and merchants. They employ a special trade jargon, which contains more or less secret names for figures. Among certain Ceṭṭi castes, mass weddings were held at intervals of 10 or 15 years, apparently for reasons of economy. Such a marriage season would last for many months.
