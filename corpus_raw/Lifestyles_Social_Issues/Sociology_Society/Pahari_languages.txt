Pahari languages,  group of Indo-Aryan languages spoken in the lower ranges of the Himalayas (pahāṛī is Hindi for “of the mountains”). Three divisions are distinguished: Eastern Pahari, represented by Nepali of Nepal; Central Pahari, spoken in Uttarakhand state; and Western Pahari, found around Simla in Himachal Pradesh state. The most important language is Nepali (Naipali), also called Khas-kura and Gorkhali (Gurkhali). Because many of the inhabitants of Nepal speak Tibeto-Burman languages, Nepali has borrowed many Tibeto-Burman idioms. The Nepali language was taken to Nepal by the Gurkha conquerors in 1769. The chief Central Pahari languages are Garhwali and Kumauni. Western Pahari includes a great number of dialects, of which the most important are Sirmauri, Kiunthali, Jaunsari, Chameali, Churahi, Mandeali, Gadi, and Kuluhi. Pahari dialects have several linguistic features in common with Rajasthani and Kashmiri.
