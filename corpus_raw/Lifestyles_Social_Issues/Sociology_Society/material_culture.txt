Material culture,  tools, weapons, utensils, machines, ornaments, art, buildings, monuments, written records, religious images, clothing, and any other ponderable objects produced or used by humans. If all the human beings in the world ceased to exist, nonmaterial aspects of culture would cease to exist along with them. However, examples of material culture would still be present until they disintegrated. The debate within social anthropology as to whether material culture is dominant in molding nonmaterial aspects is a continuing one. That the impact of material culture has varied from society to society seems clear.
The first great revolution or radical change in material culture came between 14,500 and 12,000 before the present, when the shift from food collecting to food producing, the Agricultural Revolution, was well under way. About 1800 the second great change in technology, the Industrial Revolution, took place based on the harnessing of the energy of coal, oil, gas, and heat for use in methods of production. The harnessing of atomic energy marked the beginning of the third great revolution in material culture and culture as a whole.
