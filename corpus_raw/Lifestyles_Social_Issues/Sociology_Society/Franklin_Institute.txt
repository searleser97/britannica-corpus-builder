Franklin Institute,  in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S., one of the foremost American science and technology centres. Founded in 1824, the institute embraces the Franklin Institute Science Museum and Planetarium, the Mandell Center, the Tuttleman Omniverse Theater, and the Benjamin Franklin National Memorial.
From its founding through the 19th century, the institute played a leading role in the development of engineering and commerce in Philadelphia through its lecture series, publications, and awards. The institute hosted the first International Electrical Exhibition in the United States (1884). It also offered the first public demonstration of transcontinental telephony (1916). Named for Benjamin Franklin, the institute moved into its present building in the early 1930s. The same structure houses the Benjamin Franklin National Memorial, opened in 1938; it displays a 21-foot (6-metre) marble pedestal and statue of Franklin.
