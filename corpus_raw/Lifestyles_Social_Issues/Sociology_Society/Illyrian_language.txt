Illyrian language,   Indo-European language spoken in pre-Roman times along the eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea and in southeastern Italy. The language of the Illyrian fragments found in Italy is usually called Messapic, or Messapian. Some scholars believe the modern Albanian language (q.v.) to be descended from Illyrian. See also Messapic language.
