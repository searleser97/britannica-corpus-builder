John Thomas Whitehead Mitchell,  (born Oct. 18, 1828, Rochdale, Lancashire, Eng.—died  March 16, 1895, Rochdale), dominant figure in the 19th-century English consumers’ cooperative movement.
At an early age, Mitchell joined the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers and was appointed its secretary in 1857. He shaped the policy of the Co-operative Wholesale Society, established in 1863, and was its chairman from 1874 until his death. Mitchell emphasized the fundamental importance of the consumer in the economy. His ideas provided the theoretical and practical basis of the cooperative movement in Great Britain. An essential feature of the Rochdale system, which was subsequently adopted in many other countries, was the return of dividends to members based on the total amount of their purchases in consumer-owned stores.
