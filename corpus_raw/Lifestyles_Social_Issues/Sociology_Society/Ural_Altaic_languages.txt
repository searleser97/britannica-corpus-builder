Ural-Altaic languages,   hypothetical language grouping that includes all the languages of the Uralic and Altaic language families. Most of the evidence for including the Uralic and Altaic languages in one language family is based on similarities of language structure rather than on a common core of inherited vocabulary. Common Ural-Altaic linguistic features present in most of the languages include vowel harmony (i.e., vowels in the same word must harmonize in method of articulation); grammatical traits typical of languages with a basic subject–object–verb sentence word order—e.g., the complete absence of prefixes; the use of suffixes and postpositions to express the grammatical modifications that are expressed in English by prepositions; lack of adjectival declension and of grammatical gender; and similarity in form of nouns and verbs. These types of similarities frequently arise through language contact and are not considered a valid basis for establishing genetic relationship.
