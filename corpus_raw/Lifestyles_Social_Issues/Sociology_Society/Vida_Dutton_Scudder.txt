Vida Dutton Scudder,  (born Dec. 15, 1861, Madura, India—died Oct. 9, 1954, Wellesley, Mass., U.S.), American writer, educator, and reformer whose social welfare work and activism were predicated on her socialist beliefs.
Scudder was the daughter of a Congregationalist missionary. In 1862 she and her widowed mother moved from India to the United States, settling in Boston. Scudder graduated from Smith College in 1884 and then studied Elizabethan literature for a year at the University of Oxford. In 1887 she was appointed an instructor of English at Wellesley (Massachusetts) College, becoming a full professor in 1910. Smith College awarded her an M.A. degree in 1889.
In 1888 Scudder joined the Companions of the Holy Cross, a semimonastic group of about 50 Episcopalian women devoted to prayer and the accomplishment of social harmony. She was active in a number of social welfare organizations and helped found the Denison House Settlement in Boston later that year. In 1903 she helped organize the Women’s Trade Union League. Her support of the striking textile workers in Lawrence, Massachusetts, led to widespread criticism of her and of Wellesley in 1912, but the college remained steadfast in defense of her right to speak and act freely.
Scudder wrote numerous books on both literature and her socialist ideals, including The Life of the Spirit in the Modern English Poets (1895), Introduction to the Study of English Literature (1901), Socialism and Character (1912), and her autobiography On Journey (1937). Scudder retired from teaching in 1928.
