Sabellic dialects,   group of minor Italic dialects spoken in central and southern Italy, closely related to the Oscan language (q.v.). Those dialects spoken by the Paeligni, Marrucini, and Vestini are considered North Oscan, and those spoken by the Volsci, Marsi, Aequi, and Sabini are sometimes called Latinian.
A group of inscriptions from eastern central Italy, sometimes referred to as Sabellic, or Old Sabellic, are not so closely related to Oscan (although there are certain affinities) and are better termed Central Adriatic. These Central Adriatic inscriptions are among the oldest written documents yet found in Italy and date at least from the 6th century bc.
