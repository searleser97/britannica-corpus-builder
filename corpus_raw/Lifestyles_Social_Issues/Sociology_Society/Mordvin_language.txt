Mordvin language,  member of the Finno-Ugric group of the Uralic language family, spoken in Mordvinia and neighbouring areas. The third largest Uralic language in number of speakers, Mordvin ranks after Hungarian and Finnish. It has two major dialects: Erzya, spoken in the eastern portion of Mordvinia and the surrounding territory, and Moksha, spoken in the west. Both dialects are currently written and have official status, and their speakers have been known to identify themselves as separate ethnic groups. Indeed, they lack a common name for their language; Mordvin is an exonym, or name used primarily by outsiders. Mordvin is most closely related to the Mari language, with which it makes up the Volga-Finnic subgroup of the Finnic languages of Finno-Ugric.
