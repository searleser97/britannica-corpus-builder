Herophilus,   (born c. 335 bc, Chalcedon, Bithynia—died c. 280), Alexandrian physician who was an early performer of public dissections on human cadavers; and often called the father of anatomy.
As a member of the well-known scholastic community in the newly founded city of Alexandria during the single, brief period in Greek medical history when the ban on human dissection was lifted, Herophilus studied the ventricles (cavities) of the brain, the organ he regarded as the centre of the nervous system; traced the sinuses of the dura mater (the tough membrane covering the brain) to their junction, known as the torcular Herophili; and classified the nerve trunks—distinguishing them from tendons and blood vessels—as motor or sensory.
He rendered careful accounts of the eye, liver, salivary glands, pancreas, and genital organs of both sexes. He described and named the duodenum, at the lower end of the stomach, and the prostate gland. A student of Hippocrates’ doctrine of medicine, which was based on balancing the four humours (body fluids)—blood, phlegm, yellow bile (choler), and black bile (melancholy)—Herophilus emphasized the curative powers of drugs, dietetics, and gymnastics. He was first to measure the pulse, for which he used a water clock.
Herophilus wrote at least nine works, including a commentary on Hippocrates, a book for midwives, and treatises on anatomy and the causes of sudden death, all lost in the destruction of the library of Alexandria (ad 272).
