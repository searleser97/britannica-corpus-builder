Mormaer, also spelled Mormaor,   (from Gaelic mor, “great”; maer, or maor, “steward,” or “bailiff”), ruler of any of seven provinces into which Celtic Scotland (i.e., the part of the country north of the Forth and the Clyde) was divided. This Celtic title was rendered jarl by the Norsemen and after the 12th century, under Anglo-Norman influence, “earl.” The seven mormaerships, or original “earldoms,” of Scotland were Angus, Atholl with Gowrie, Caithness with Sutherland, Fife, Mar with Buchan, Moray with Ross, and Strath Earn with Menteith.
