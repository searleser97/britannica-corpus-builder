Besides his academic work, Stanner was an advocate of Aboriginal rights. As a newspaper reporter during the 1930s, he became aware of the plight of the Aborigines and began to campaign on their behalf. Stanner was a member of the Commonwealth Council for Aboriginal Affairs from 1967 to 1977 and in 1979 became a founding member of the Aboriginal Treaty Committee. His broadcast lectures, After the Dreaming (1968), reached a wide audience. In 1979 he published White Man Got No Dreaming, a collection of articles. Stanner was appointed Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St. George (CMG) in 1972.
