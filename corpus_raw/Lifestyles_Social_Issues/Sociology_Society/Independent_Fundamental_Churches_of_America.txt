Independent Fundamental Churches of America,  fellowship of conservative, independent Christian churches stressing biblical truth. It was organized in Cicero, Illinois, U.S., in June 1930 as the successor to the American Conference of Undenominational Churches.
Member churches are forbidden to affiliate with any denomination, and the fellowship, administered by annually elected trustees, cannot organize itself as a denomination. Individuals may also seek membership, and those who do are usually ministers, missionaries, Bible teachers, evangelists, editors of Christian periodicals, or students. Each year members profess 16 articles of faith that include the original five points of fundamentalismâ€”the literal truth of divinely inspired scripture, the Virgin Birth and deity of Christ, substitutionary atonement through Christ, the Resurrection, and the Second Coming of Christ.
In 1995 the group reported 69,857 members and 670 congregations. Headquarters are in Grandville, Michigan.
