Orphan train program,  American social-service program in the second half of the 19th century and the early 20th century in which orphaned and abandoned children were transported from New York City and other overcrowded Eastern urban centres to the rural Midwest. The program’s most-prominent leader was Charles Loring Brace, founder of the Children’s Aid Society.
The second half of the 19th century saw a tremendous surge in immigration into the United States, with a large proportion of immigrants arriving in New York City. There the working and living conditions were anything but salubrious, and the high mortality rate among immigrants led to the growth of a large population of homeless orphans. Orphanages—such as the Children’s Aid Society, the New York Juvenile Asylum, and the New York Foundling Hospital—were set up to care for such children, but their capacities came far short of the need.
One solution was to send the children by train to the relatively scarcely populated Midwest—to Missouri and Illinois, for example—where they would be adopted by (or at least included in the households of) farming families. Brace organized the first transports of children by train to the Midwest. The trains came to be known as “orphan trains” or “baby trains.” Advertisements were posted in Midwestern towns, especially through churches, asking families to sign up for children who would be brought by train from New York.
The phenomenon of the orphan trains lasted for some 75 years, from the first orphan train’s arrival in Dowagiac, Michigan, in 1854 to the last one’s reaching Trenton, Missouri, in 1929. An estimated total of 150,000 to 400,000 children were relocated. Many of those children were genuinely taken in by farm families and were adopted and treated as their own children; for others, the situation may have been closer to being a servant or field hand who received lodging and food, and in a few cases there was direct abuse.
