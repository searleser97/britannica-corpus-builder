Fur languages,  two closely related languages that form part of the Nilo-Saharan language family. Fur proper is spoken mainly in western Sudan and adjacent parts of Chad. The closely related Amdang language is spoken by the Amdang, primarily of Chad, who are also called Biltine, or Mimi; the latter name, however, is used for a number of ethnic groups in the area who speak different languages (see Sidebar: The Peoples Known as Mimi). Many speakers of Fur and Amdang languages who live in urban settings are shifting to Arabic as a first language.
