Otomanguean languages,  a phylum, or stock, of American Indian languages composed mainly of Amuzgoan, Oto-Pamean, Popolocan, Subtiaba-Tlapanecan, Mixtecan, Zapotecan, and Chinantecan. The living languages of these groups are spoken in Mexico, although varieties of Mangue, all of which are extinct, were spoken along the western coast of Central America from El Salvador through Costa Rica.
The most important of the Otomanguean languages are Otomí, of the Oto-Pamean family, spoken in the Mexican states of Hidalgo, México, Veracruz, Querétaro, and adjacent states; Mixtec dialects, of the Mixtecan family, spoken in the states of Guerrero, Puebla, and Oaxaca; Zapotec dialects (or languages), of the Zapotecan family, spoken in Oaxaca; and Mazahua, of the Oto-Pamean family, spoken in the states of Michoacán and México. Many Otomanguean languages use a complex system of pitches or intonations to distinguish otherwise identical utterances.
