Caroline Chisholm,  née Jones,  (born May 1808?, near Northampton, Northamptonshire, Eng.—died March 25, 1877, London), British-born Australian philanthropist.
Caroline Jones married an officer in the East India Company, Archibald Chisholm, in 1830. In 1838 she and her husband settled at Windsor, near Sydney, in Australia. Australia had large numbers of unemployed immigrant labourers at this time, and Caroline Chisholm established a home in Sydney for destitute immigrant girls, for whom she found jobs in the countryside. Her first report on her work, Female Immigration, Considered in a Brief Account of the Sydney Immigrants’ Home (1842), was the most sizable publication by an Australia-based woman to that date. She spent the years from 1846 to 1854 in England, raising funds for the immigration of whole families to Australia, a task rendered unnecessary by the gold rush to Australia in the early 1850s. Charles Dickens was among those whom she influenced. Chisholm returned to Australia in 1854 and lectured on and made inspections of the living conditions in the goldfields. Her health broke down in 1857, and in 1866 she and her family returned to England, where she was granted a government pension of £100 in 1867. Her pioneering social work has always been acclaimed in Australia.
