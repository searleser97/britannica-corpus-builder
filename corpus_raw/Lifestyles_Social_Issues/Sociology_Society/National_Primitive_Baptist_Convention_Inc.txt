National Primitive Baptist Convention, Inc.,,   association of independent black Baptist churches in the United States that were joined in a national convention in 1907. The convention developed from black congregations formed after the American Civil War by emancipated slaves who had previously attended Primitive Baptist churches with whites.
Although they have followed much of the doctrine and practice of the white Primitive Baptists, the black Primitive Baptists have set up a national convention and have established Sunday schools and aid societies, all of which are rejected by the whites. In the late 20th century the convention had more than 250,000 members.
