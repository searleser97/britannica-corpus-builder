Ellen Russell Emerson, née Ellen Russell,  (born Jan. 16, 1837, New Sharon, Maine, U.S.—died June 12, 1907, Cambridge, Mass.),  American ethnologist, noted for her extensive examinations of Native American cultures, especially in comparison with other world cultures.
Ellen Russell was educated at the Mount Vernon Seminary in Boston and in 1862 married Edwin R. Emerson. From a childhood meeting with Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, she had developed a strong interest in Native American lore and legend, and with the years her studies grew more serious and systematic. John Wesley Powell of the Smithsonian Institution’s Bureau of American Ethnology and other scholars provided her encouragement and assistance. In 1884 she published Indian Myths; or, Legends, Traditions, and Symbols of the Aborigines of America Compared with Those of Other Countries, Including Hindostan, Egypt, Persia, Assyria and China, a voluminous study in comparative ethnology that was long of great value to students in the field.
From 1886 to 1889 Emerson studied under Gaston Maspero in Paris and other leading ethnologists in Germany and Italy. In 1891 she published Masks, Heads, and Faces, with Some Considerations Respecting the Rise and Development of Art, a study of primitive design from pictographic writing to pottery decoration, giving particular attention to Mexican and Native American artifacts. Her last book was a collection of essays entitled Nature and Human Nature (1902). Emerson was widely honoured for her work and was a member of a number of international learned societies.
