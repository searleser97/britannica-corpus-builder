Ableism,  type of discrimination in which able-bodied individuals are viewed as normal and superior to those with a disability, resulting in prejudice toward the latter. The modern concept of ableism emerged in the 1960s and â€™70s, when disability activists placed disability in a political context.
Discrimination against disabled persons occurs in countries worldwide and may be reflected in individual, societal, and institutional attitudes and norms and in the arrangement or dynamics of certain environments. 
Indeed, interpretations of ableism are based on perspectives of what constitutes normal ability, which often gives shape to beliefs and norms and to physical and social environments. As a result, those affected by physical, mental, or emotional impairments tend to be in the minority and may be treated differently from their normal peers. Disabled persons may experience labeling, altered expectations, and discrimination in the context of eugenics. Those factors can cause disabled persons to view ableism, rather than their impairments, as their primary barrier to community participation.
