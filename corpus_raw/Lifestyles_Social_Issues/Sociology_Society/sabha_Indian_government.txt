Sabha, (Hindi and Sanskrit: “assembly”)  important unit of self-government in Hindu society. It is basically an association of persons who have common interests, such as members of the same endogamous groups, but may also be an intercaste group (e.g., a mazdur sabha, or association of labourers).
The sabha differs from the panchayat (caste or subcaste council) in that its scope is much larger; rather than sitting in judgment on individuals, it discusses matters of general interest. Typical is the Vaishya mahasabha (“great assembly”), the executive of the Vaishya conference, the objects of which are the spread of education and social reform and the reduction of expenses required for marriages and festivals among its members, who belong to various castes of merchants and artisans. The sabha gave its name to the two houses of India’s Parliament, the Lok Sabha (“House of the People”) and the Rajya Sabha (“Council of States”).
