Andrew Of Lonjumel, Lonjumel also spelled Longjumeau, or Longumeau,  (flourished 1238–53), French Dominican friar who, as an ambassador of Louis IX (St. Louis) of France, led a diplomatic mission destined for the court of the Mongol khan Güyük. His report of the journey across Central Asia and back (1249 to 1251/52), though a mixture of fact and fiction, contains noteworthy observations.
On his first diplomatic mission, to Constantinople (1238), he brought back the relic revered as Christ’s crown of thorns, for which Louis built Sainte-Chapelle at Paris as a repository. In 1247 he accompanied a mission sent by Pope Innocent IV to the Mongols at Kars, Armenia (now in Turkey), and returned to Louis with a Mongol proposal for a joint attack upon Islām for the conquest of Syria. Louis then sent Andrew on a diplomatic mission to Güyük to continue negotiations. Departing from Cyprus with several companions early in 1249, he travelled around the southern and eastern shores of the Caspian Sea and, continuing through Turkistan north of Tashkent, went on to Karakorum in central Mongolia. Upon reaching the court, Andrew found that Güyük was dead, and was sent back to Louis with an insolent letter from the regent mother, Ogul-Gaimish. Andrew’s account of the journey, though known only from references in the travel writings of the Franciscan friar William of Rubruquis, describes Tatar customs with fair accuracy.
