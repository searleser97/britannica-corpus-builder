Okot p’Bitek,  (born 1931, Gulu, Uganda—died July 19, 1982, Kampala), Ugandan poet, novelist, and social anthropologist whose three verse collections—Song of Lawino (1966), Song of Ocol (1970), and Two Songs (1971)—are considered to be among the best African poetry in print.
As a youth p’Bitek had varied interests; he published a novel in the Acholi language (later published in English as White Teeth [1989]), wrote an opera, and played on Uganda’s football (soccer) team. He was educated at the University of Bristol in England (certificate in education), University College of Wales at Aberystwyth (bachelor of law), and the Institute of Social Anthropology at Oxford (degree in social anthropology). From 1964 to 1966 he taught at Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda.
His first collection of poetry, Song of Lawino, addresses the issue of the conflict of cultures. It is the lament of a nonliterate woman over the strange ways of her university-educated husband, whose new ways are incompatible with traditional African concepts of manhood. This book p’Bitek followed with Song of Ocol, which is the husband’s response. A third volume, Two Songs, includes Song of a Prisoner and Song of Malaya.
After serving as director of Uganda’s National Theatre and National Cultural Centre (1966–68), p’Bitek accepted a position as senior research fellow and lecturer at University College, Nairobi, Kenya (1971–78). He was also a visiting lecturer or writer in residence at several universities. From 1978 to 1982 he taught at the University of Ife in Nigeria.
In addition to writing poetry, p’Bitek produced several books on Acholi culture. Some of his essays are collected in Africa’s Cultural Revolution (1975). The Horn of My Love (1974) contains Acholi poetry in both Acholi and English, and Hare and Hornbill (1978) is a collection of Acholi folktales that p’Bitek compiled and translated.
