Uji,   any of the hereditary lineage groups that, until their official abolition in ad 604, formed the basic, decentralized ruling structure of early Japan. They are often referred to as the great clans because of their traditions of common descent, and they were ruled by an uji chief who was considered a direct descendant of the deity (ujigami) worshiped by the groupâ€™s members. The uji members, who had the privilege of having personal surnames and being called by titles of respect, were supported by the labour of common workers, who were organized into subunits of the uji known as be (q.v.).
When the Yamato uji began to establish itself as the leading power in the 3rd century, its chief created the Japanese imperial line, which is said to be descended from Amaterasu, the sun goddess and deity of the Yamato. Imperial rule over the autonomous uji remained weak until the adoption of centralized government in the mid-7th century.
