Monogamy,   the custom that allows a person to be legally married to only one spouse at one time. Appearing in two general forms, monogamy may imply a lifelong contract between two individuals that may be broken only under penalty—as prevails in the Roman Catholic and Hindu prescriptions for marriage—or it may imply that persons are required to be monogamous but may change spouses repeatedly, a practice sometimes called serial monogamy.
