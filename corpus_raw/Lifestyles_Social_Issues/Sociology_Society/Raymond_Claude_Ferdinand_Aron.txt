Raymond Aron,  (born March 14, 1905, Paris, France—died  Oct. 17, 1983, Paris), French sociologist, historian, and political commentator known for his skepticism of ideological orthodoxies.
The son of a Jewish jurist, Aron obtained his doctorate in 1930 from the École Normale Supérieure with a thesis on the philosophy of history. He was a professor of social philosophy at the University of Toulouse when World War II broke out in 1939, upon which he joined the French air force. After the fall of France he joined the Free French forces of General Charles de Gaulle in London and edited their newspaper, La France Libre (“Free France”), from 1940 to 1944. On his return to France he became a professor at the École Nationale d’Administration, and from 1955 to 1968 he was professor of sociology at the Sorbonne. From 1970 he was professor at the Collège de France. Throughout his life Aron was active as a journalist, and in 1947 he became a highly influential columnist for Le Figaro, a position he held for 30 years. He left Le Figaro in 1977, and from then until his death he wrote a political column for the weekly magazine L’Express.
Aron upheld a rationalist humanism that was often contrasted with the Marxist existentialism of his great contemporary, Jean-Paul Sartre. Though his range was slightly narrower than Sartre’s and his international renown less general, Aron enjoyed a position of intellectual authority among French moderates and conservatives that almost rivaled Sartre’s on the left. Among Aron’s most influential works were L’Opium des intellectuels (1955; The Opium of the Intellectuals), which criticized left-wing conformism and the totalitarian tendencies of Marxist regimes. Aron himself became a strong supporter of the Western alliance. In La Tragédie algérienne (1957; “The Algerian Tragedy”) he voiced his support for Algerian independence, and in République impériale: Les États-Unis dans le monde, 1945–1972 (1973; The Imperial Republic: The United States and the World, 1945–1973), he attacked the unthinking hostility aimed at the United States by French leftists. A continuing theme in his writings was the subject of violence and war, as evidenced in such works as Paix et guerre entre les nations (1962; Peace and War) and his books on the Prussian military theorist Carl von Clausewitz. Aron also wrote an influential history of sociology entitled Les Étapes de la pensée sociologique (1967; Main Currents in Sociological Thought). His memoirs were published in 1983.
