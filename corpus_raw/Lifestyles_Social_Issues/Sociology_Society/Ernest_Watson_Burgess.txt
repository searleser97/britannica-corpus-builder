Ernest Watson Burgess,  (born May 16, 1886, Tilbury, Ontario, Canada—died  December 27, 1966, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.), American sociologist known for his research into the family as a social unit.
Burgess received his B.A. (1908) from Kingfisher College (Oklahoma) and his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago (1913). He taught at the Universities of Toledo (Ohio) and Kansas and at Ohio State University before beginning a long career at the University of Chicago (1916–66), becoming professor emeritus in 1951.
Burgess’s scientific inquiry into the nature of the family led him to investigate marriage stability and the possibility of predicting success or failure in marriage. He theorized that the quality of adjustment depended on the gradual coalescence of attitudes and social characteristics of the husband and wife. From his findings, Burgess developed his marriage success chart for predicting marital stability.
His findings on the family are published in many works, including Predicting Success or Failure in Marriage (1939; with Leonard Cottrell) and The Family: From Institution to Companionship (1945; with others;  rev. ed. 1960). Burgess also studied the elderly, editing Aging in Western Societies (1960), a work that considered the effects of retirement and the efficacy of government programs for the aged. One of Burgess’s most important works was Introduction to the Science of Sociology (1921; with Robert Park), a textbook that became a classic and mapped new directions in sociology. Much of Burgess’s collaborative research with Park focused on urban land use and the social aspects of the urban community.
