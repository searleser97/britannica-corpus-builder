Indigenous governance,  patterns and practices of rule by which indigenous people govern themselves in formal and informal settings.
Indigenous peoples are the original inhabitants of geographic regions. The term indigenous peoples is often used to refer to those native inhabitants who were dispossessed of their land by outside peoples, either by conquest, occupation, settlement, or some combination of the three. The term most commonly refers to those peoples subjugated since the late 15th century by European powers and their colonies. Indigenous governance refers to the myriad ways in which these peoples have governed themselves or continue doing so despite the fact of colonization.
Such governance practices can be organized into three broad categories:
Indigenous governance practices often take on more than one of these dimensions simultaneously, such as working within structures formally sanctioned by the colonial power but also simultaneously modifying and resisting them. Furthermore, because indigenous governance is a set of practices that is always changing with the needs of indigenous peoples and with the colonial setting itself, it cannot be formalized as consisting of any particular one of these relationships, institutions, or goals.
