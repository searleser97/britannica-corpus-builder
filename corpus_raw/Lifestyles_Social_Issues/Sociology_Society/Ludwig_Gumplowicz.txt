Ludwig Gumplowicz, Polish Ludwik Gumplowicz,  (born March 9, 1838, Kraków, Republic of Kraków [now in Poland]—died  Aug. 19/20, 1909, Graz, Austria), sociologist and legal philosopher who was known for his disbelief in the permanence of social progress and for his theory that the state originates through inevitable conflict rather than through cooperation or divine inspiration.
The son of Jewish parents, Gumplowicz studied at the universities of Kraków and Vienna and became professor of public law at the University of Graz in 1875. The Outlines of Sociology (2nd ed., 1963) is a translation of Gumplowicz’ Grundriss der Soziologie (1885). His major works were written in German except for the Polish-language System socyologii (1887).
In Gumplowicz’ view, human beings have an innate tendency to form groups and develop a feeling of unity. He called this process syngenism. Initially, conflict arises between prepolitical racial groups. When one racial group has prevailed, it forms a state that becomes an amalgam of victor and vanquished. Wars then take place between states, and the process of conquest and assimilation occurs again, on a larger scale. Finally, each state creates by coercion a system of division of labour; as a result, social classes are formed, and they also engage in conflict. Laws are determined by victory in class struggles rather than by any notion of abstract justice. Higher civilization owes its existence to warfare in that culture is a product of prosperity, and leisure is made possible by conquest. Considering history a cyclical process, Gumplowicz denied that social planning and welfare measures can save societies from ultimate collapse.
Among the leading sociologists strongly influenced by Gumplowicz were Gustav Ratzenhofer, Albion W. Small, and Franz Oppenheimer. The social scientists Émile Durkheim, León Duguit, Harold J. Laski, and others elaborated Gumplowicz’ view of political parties as interest groups.
