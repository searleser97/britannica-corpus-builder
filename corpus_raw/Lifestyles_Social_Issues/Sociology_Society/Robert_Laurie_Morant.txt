Sir Robert Laurie Morant,  (born April 7, 1863, London, England—died March 13, 1920, London), British civil servant, closely associated with the development of educational and health services in his country.
Morant was educated at Winchester and New College, Oxford, and went in November 1886 to Siam (now Thailand) as tutor to the royal family and prepared for King Chulalongkorn an educational plan for the whole country. He returned to England in August 1894 and, after some experience with social and educational work in the East End of London, joined the Education Department in 1895 as assistant director of special inquiries and reports. As private secretary to successive ministers, he was largely responsible for preparing Arthur Balfour’s Education Act of 1902. In April 1903 he became permanent secretary to the Board of Education. In 1907 he was created Knight Commander of the Bath.
Appointed chairman of the National Health Insurance Commission, Morant left the Board of Education and created the organization that brought the National Insurance Act of 1911 into operation. Increasingly absorbed in the plan to merge his health insurance work into a wider national health organization, he became secretary to the Ministry of Health on its formation in 1919; he died the next year. Morant was a key figure in translating the new collectivist Liberal politics of the late 19th century into an elaborated plan of governmental action.
