Nonliterate society,  a people or culture without a written language. The term nonliterate is distinguished from “illiterate,” which indicates a member of a literate society who has not learned to read or write. Although the term is not entirely satisfactory because it distinguishes by the sole criterion of written language, it has several advantages over the loosely equivalent terms primitive, preliterate, preurban, savage, and others.
