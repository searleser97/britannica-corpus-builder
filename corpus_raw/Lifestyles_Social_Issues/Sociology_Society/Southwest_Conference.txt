Southwest Conference,  former American collegiate athletic organization founded in 1914 with eight members: the University of Arkansas, Baylor University, the University of Oklahoma, Oklahoma Agriculture and Mining College (now Oklahoma State University), William Marsh Rice Institute (now Rice University), Southwestern University, the University of Texas (Austin), and the Texas Agricultural and Mechanical College (now Texas A&M University). Later Southwestern University (1916), Oklahoma (1920), and Oklahoma A&M (1925) left the conference, while the University of Houston, Southern Methodist University (SMU), Texas Christian University (TCU), and Texas Tech University eventually joined. Arkansas left the conference in 1991.
Known for razzle-dazzle passing offenses in gridiron football in the 1930s, the Southwest Conference first gained national respect in 1935, when SMU and TCU played for the national championship on the final day of the regular season. The conference continued to be known for its great passers, from Sammy Baugh and Davey O’Brien of TCU in the 1930s to Bobby Layne of Texas and Fred Benners and Don Meredith of SMU in the ’40s and ’50s. It also was identified with the state of Texas and its rabid football culture. Thus, the dissolution of the conference in 1996, following a series of probations meted out to member institutions by the National Collegiate Athletic Association and because of the demands of the television industry for a larger regional audience, marked the end of a distinctive and colourful institution in the world of college football.
