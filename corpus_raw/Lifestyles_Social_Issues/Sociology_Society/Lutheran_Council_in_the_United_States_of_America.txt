Lutheran Council in the United States of America (LCUSA),  cooperative agency for four Lutheran churches whose membership included about 95 percent of all Lutherans in the U.S., established Jan. 1, 1967, as a successor to the National Lutheran Council (NLC). The member churches were the Lutheran Church in America, the American Lutheran Church, the Lutheran Churchâ€“Missouri Synod, and the Synod of Evangelical Lutheran Churches.
The NLC, organized in 1918, had served eight Lutheran churches as a cooperative organization and had developed various programs, including social service, missions, public relations, service to military personnel, service to students, and overseas aid. When it seemed probable in the late 1950s that the eight member churches of the NLC would merge into two churches (subsequently the American Lutheran Church [1960] and the Lutheran Church in America [1963]), it became necessary to restructure the NLC.
In 1959 the Missouri Synod accepted an invitation to consider a more inclusive Lutheran agency, and consultations in 1960 and 1961 led to agreements to establish the LCUSA. This was a breakthrough in cooperation among Lutherans in the United States, because the conservative Missouri Synod had previously refused to consider joining a cooperative agency unless doctrinal agreement had been reached by all participants. It agreed, however, to join the LCUSA when it was assured that all participants would take part in doctrinal discussions as part of the program of the council. Subsequently, the small (21,000 members in the late 1960s) Synod of Evangelical Lutheran Churches also agreed to join in forming the new council. In 1977 the Missouri Synod withdrew from the council.
The LCUSA continued much of the work of the NLC, with the added emphasis on doctrinal and theological discussions and study.
