Shan language, Shan Tai,  language spoken in the northern and eastern states of Myanmar (Burma) and belonging to the Southwestern group of the Tai language family of Southeast Asia. Its speakers, known as the Shan people to outsiders, call themselves and their language Tai, often adding a modifier such as a specific place-name or other term (e.g., Tai Long: “Great Tai”). Like the other Tai languages, Shan is largely monosyllabic in word form and makes use of tones to distinguish between otherwise identically pronounced words. Although closely related to Thai (Siamese) and Lao (Laotian), Shan differs from them in being more strictly monosyllabic and in borrowing many words from Burmese. Shan is written in an alphabet derived from the Burmese writing system. This alphabet, with its lack of both vowel and tone markers, was inadequate and difficult to read even for a Shan speaker until these defects were corrected by a series of orthographic reforms culminating in 1955.
