Rugby Football League,  governing body of rugby league football (professional rugby) in England, founded in 1895. Originally called the Northern Rugby Football Union (popularly Northern Union), it was formed when 22 clubs from Yorkshire, Lancashire, and Cheshire left the Rugby Football Union over the question of compensation for loss of wages sustained by players while participating in games. Later, league play spread to Australia, New Zealand, France, and other countries. The present name was adopted in 1922. The league publishes an annual handbook, and its headquarters are in Leeds, West Yorkshire.
