Apabhramsha language,  literary language of the final phase of the Middle Indo-Aryan languages. When the Prakrit languages were formalized by literary use, their variations came to be known as Apabhramsha. Despite this close relationship, scholars generally treat Apabhramsha and the nonliterary Prakrits separately.
The Middle Indo-Aryan languages are differentiated from Old Indo-Aryan—the Classical Sanskrit used in the Vedas—by significant changes in phonology and morphology. Conservative grammarians branded all such departures as apabhramsha (“deviance”). Patanjali (2nd century bce), for instance, identified Prakrit words such as gavi and goni as apabhramsha of the Sanskrit word go.
The Brahman sage Bharata mentions in his Natyashastra (1st century bce–3rd century ce) two types of vernacular, the Prakrits (bhasas) and their corruptions (vibhasas), in the dialects spoken by the Sabara, Abhira, and Candala peoples. In the late 6th or early 7th century, Dandin said that in poetry the languages of the Abhira and other common folk were called Apabhramsha. These commentaries imply that by the 3rd century there were certain dialects called Apabhramsha and that these gradually rose to the literary level.
By the 6th century, Apabhramsha was recognized as a literary language. Dharasena II, the king of Valabhi at that time, created an inscription in which he described his father, Guhasena, as an expert in composing poetry in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and Apabhramsha. Bhamaha, an early prosodist of the 6th or 7th century, divides poetry into Sanskrit, Prakrit, and Apabhramsha. Apabhramsha continued in this capacity until the end of the Middle Indo-Aryan period. In its stereotyped form, it even persisted into the early phase of the New Indo-Aryan period (10th century).
Most of the extant literature in Apabhramsha is based on Jain mythology, legends, and ethics. Classic texts include the Paumacariu of Svayambhu (8th–9th century), a Jain version of the Ramayana; the Mahapurana of Pushpadanta (10th century), based on the lives of Jain legendary figures; the Bhavisattakaha of Dhanpala (10th century); and the Pasanahachariu of Padmakirti (11th century). Doha verses, in which each verse is complete in itself and embodies an independent concept, are also a favourite literary form in Apabhramsha.
The Gujarat king Hemachandra (12th century) treated Apabhramsha at length in his grammar of Prakrit. He is said to have based his observations on the western dialects. It is likely that these dialects pioneered Apabhramsha poetry, which then gradually spread to the southern and eastern parts of the Indo-Aryan language area.
As previously noted, Apabhramsha has a number of unique phonological and morphological characteristics. These features show a marked departure from the synthetic nature of the Old Indo-Aryan languages, which had still been lingering in the early phases of the Middle Indo-Aryan, and paved the way for the advent of the New Indo-Aryan languages.
Among these characteristics are that there is increased vocalic flexibility, in which one vowel may be substituted for another; the ending vowel of words that have declensional terminations may be shortened or lengthened; the pronunciation of /e/ and /o/ is shortened when compounded with a consonant; and the pronunciation of /um/, /ham/, /him/, and /hum/ is shortened when positioned at the end of a metrical foot (the type and number of feet determine the rhythm of a verse).
Sound changes also occur among the consonants. An /r/ can be optionally retained as the final member of a conjunct, and it is also sometimes substituted for the final (non-/-r/) member of a conjunct. Intervocalic consonants—those that are immediately preceded and followed by vowels—may change. For instance, /-k-/, /-kh-/, /-t-/, /-th-/, /-p-/, and /-ph-/ change, respectively, to /-g-/, /-gh-/, /-d-/, /-dh-/, /-b-/, and /-bh-/; /-m-/ changes to /-v-/; and /-mha-/ (from /-ksma-/ and /-sma-/) optionally changes to /-mbha-/.
Apabhramsha inflectional features include the merging of the a-, i-, and u-stems of feminine and neuter words (see gender). The a-stems express the nominative and accusative cases in an identical manner (taking /u/ in the singular and /a/ in the plural). In addition, the instrumental case merges with the locative case, and the ablative coincides with the dative/genitive.
Apabhramsha adds inflectional suffixes to words to avoid confusion between cases that are otherwise expressed identically. Examples include the use of /-tana/ to indicate ablative; /-tana/ or /-kera/ to indicate genitive; and /-majjha/ to indicate locative. In conjugation, Apabhramsha has developed additional terminations. In the present tense, for instance, the first person singular /-um/ becomes the plural /-hum/; the second person singular /-hi/ becomes the plural /-hu/; and the third person singular /-hi/ remains unchanged in the plural. Finally, while substitution of the past participle passive form for the finite verb in the past tense is quite frequent in the Prakrits, it has become almost a rule in Apabhramsha.
