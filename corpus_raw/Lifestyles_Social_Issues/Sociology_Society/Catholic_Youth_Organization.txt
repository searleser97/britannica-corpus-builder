Catholic Youth Organization (CYO),  an agency of the Roman Catholic Church organized at the level of the diocese and serving youth in its religious, recreational, cultural, and social needs. The first Catholic Youth Organization (CYO), a boys’ athletic program, was founded in Chicago in 1930 by Bishop Bernard Sheil. Dioceses in other cities, primarily in the United States, founded their own CYOs during the following decades, offering sports and a range of other activities.
Membership in CYOs is based on participation. Activities are geared toward boys and girls six years of age and older and are designed to develop character and prevent delinquency. The CYO administers orphans’ homes, music departments, vacation centres, and lecture bureaus; it also provides scholarships, various athletic programs, and cultural and social programs for high school students. The entirely autonomous diocesan CYO programs are affiliated with the National Federation for Catholic Youth Ministry, located in Washington, D.C.
