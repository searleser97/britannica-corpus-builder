Anders Danielsson,  (born Jan. 14, 1784, Bondarp, Swed.—died  April 22, 1839, Surte), the foremost peasant leader in early 19th-century Sweden.
Danielsson was elected to the peasant chamber of the Riksdag (Parliament) in 1809. At the height of his career he came to represent 27 districts in that body, a unique achievement in Swedish parliamentary history. The peasant program for which he fought included such points as reduced military expenditures, mass public education, sharp cutbacks in civil-service spending, free trade, free choice of occupation, and abolition of land taxes. These points were ultimately achieved, as was increased representation in the Riksdag, a persistent demand of the general liberal opposition to the government during the middle decades of the century. Danielsson was a leader of that opposition and worked closely with his counterpart in the nobles’ chamber, Count Carl Henrik Anckarsvärd.
