Eupatrid,   (Greek: “of a good father”), member of the nobility of ancient Athens. It is likely that public office before 594 bc was in practice confined to the eupatridae and that they had a political monopoly comparable to that of other Greek aristocracies in the Archaic period. Solon’s reforms, by establishing property qualifications for office, limited their power, which disappeared entirely after 580.
