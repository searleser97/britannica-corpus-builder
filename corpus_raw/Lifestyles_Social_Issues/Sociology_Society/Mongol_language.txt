Mongol language, also called Mongolian language,  principal member of the Mongolian language family within the Altaic language group, spoken by some seven million people in Mongolia and in the autonomous regions of Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang and the provinces of Qinghai and Gansu in China. The Khalkha dialect constitutes the basis for the official language of Mongolia. The other dialects, the number and grouping of which are controversial, are spoken predominantly in China. With the closely related Buryat language, Mongol forms the eastern group of Mongolian languages.
The traditional Mongolian script, used in China and scheduled to be reintroduced as the official written language of Mongolia in 2025, is ultimately of Syriac derivation. It was borrowed from the Turkic Uighurs, who themselves borrowed it from the Sogdians, an Iranian people. Mongolian letters have different forms depending on their position (initial, medial, final) in a word. The script is written in columns vertically, from the top of the page down and from left to right. Known as Classical, or Literary, Mongolian, the written language generally represents the language as it was spoken in the era of Genghis Khan and differs in many respects from the present-day spoken language, although some colloquial features were introduced into Classical Mongolian in the 19th century. Though best known for its centuries-old role in the transmission of Buddhistic literature from Tibetan, Sanskrit, and Chinese sources, Classical Mongolian has proved remarkably durable and equal to the task of a modern national language.
