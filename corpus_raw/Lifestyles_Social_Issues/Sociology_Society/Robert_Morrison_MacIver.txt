Robert Morrison MacIver,  (born April 17, 1882, Stornoway, Outer Hebrides, Scot.—died  June 15, 1970, New York City), Scottish-born sociologist, political scientist, and educator who expressed belief in the compatibility of individualism and social organization. His creative power to make distinctions between state and community led to new theories of democracy, of multi-group coexistence, and of the nature of authority.
After receiving his A.B. from the University of Oxford and his Ph.D. from the University of Edinburgh (1915), MacIver taught political science at the University of Toronto (1915–27). There he wrote Community: A Sociological Study (1917) and Elements of Social Science (1921).
MacIver then went to the United States, where he joined the faculty of Barnard College (1927–36). Subsequently he was professor of political philosophy and sociology at Columbia University (1929–50) and was president (1963–65) and chancellor (1965–66) of the New School for Social Research, New York City.
MacIver upheld the idea that societies evolve from highly communal states to ones in which individual functions and group affiliations are extremely specialized. He felt that the sociologist must avoid imposing his own values on social fact. He also stressed that social evolution is not necessarily equivalent to social progress, which he felt could only be measured by personal judgment.
Among his numerous writings are Society: Its Structure and Changes (1931); Leviathan and the People (1939); The Web of Government (1947); The More Perfect Union (1948); The Pursuit of Happiness (1955); The Nations and the United Nations (1959); Power Transformed (1964); The Prevention and Control of Delinquency (1966); his autobiography, As a Tale That Is Told (1968); and Politics and Society (1969).
