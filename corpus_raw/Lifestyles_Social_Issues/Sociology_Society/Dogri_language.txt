Dogri language,  member of the Indo-Aryan group within the Indo-European languages. Dogri is spoken by approximately 2.6 million people, most commonly in the Indian union territory of Jammu and Kashmir. It is an officially recognized language of India. The earliest written reference to Dogri (using the paleonym Duggar) is found in the Nuh sipihr (“The Nine Heavens”), written by the poet Amir Khosrow in 1317 ce.
Dogri is descended from Sanskrit, the language of the Vedas (1500–1200 bce). The development of Dogri from the Vedic period to its present form has been traced through changes in phonology. For example, the word son is rendered as putra in Old Indo-Aryan (perhaps 1200–250 bce), putta in Middle Indo-Aryan (approximately 400 bce–1100 ce), and putter in Dogri (since perhaps 1100 ce). Documented phonological changes include nasalization, metathesis (the transposition of phonemes within a word), and shifts in voice and aspiration. Dogri uses length, nasalization, juncture, stress, and three tones (level, falling, and rising) to differentiate between its 10 vowel phonemes and 28 consonant phonemes.
Dogri vocabulary (but not grammatical structure) has been influenced by other languages, notably Persian and English. Within the language, variety is for the most part geographically based.
Dogri was once written in Dogra or Dogra Akkhar, the official script of Jammu and Kashmir, then a princely state, during the reign of Ranbir Singh (1857–85 ce). However, Dogra was for the most part replaced by Devanagari script during the 20th century.
