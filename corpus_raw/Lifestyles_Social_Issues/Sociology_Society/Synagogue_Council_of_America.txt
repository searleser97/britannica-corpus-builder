Synagogue Council of America,   a Jewish organization founded in 1926 to provide most congregationally affiliated Jews (regardless of individual differences) with a common voice in interfaith activities, especially those involving Christians. Council membership thus includes as Orthodox constituents the Rabbinical Council of America and the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America; as Conservative constituents, the Rabbinical Assembly of America and the United Synagogue of America; as Reform constituents, the Central Conference of American Rabbis and the Union of American Hebrew Congregations.
Though the council opposes missionary efforts aimed at converting Jews, it fosters religious understanding between Jews and Christians and works in harmony with the National Council of the Churches of Christ in the United States of America.
