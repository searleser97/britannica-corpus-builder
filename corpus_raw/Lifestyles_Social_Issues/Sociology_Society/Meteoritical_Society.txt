Meteoritical Society,  international scientific organization that promotes research and education on meteorites and other extraterrestrial materials such as interplanetary dust, interstellar grains, and samples from the Moon. Additional areas of research include impact craters, asteroids, comets, planets, and the origin and history of the solar system.
Established in 1933 as the Society for Research on Meteorites, the organization elected its founder, the astronomer Frederick C. Leonard of the University of California at Los Angeles, as its first president. Annual meetings were suspended during World War II; when they reconvened in 1946, the members adopted the name Meteoritical Society. With the advent of the space age, the society grew rapidly and became international in membership and broader in scope. Membership is drawn from more than 30 countries, and meetings are usually held in North America and Europe in alternating years.
The society awards several annual medals and sponsors two scientific journalsâ€”Meteoritics and Planetary Science (monthly), which deals with all research topics of interest to the society, and Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta (twice monthly; jointly with the Geochemical Society), which focuses on meteorite chemistry. Its nomenclature committee approves names proposed for all newly recovered meteorites and oversees publication of the Meteoritical Bulletin, which records new meteorites and gives their basic characterizations and locations. The society also provides scientific leadership for international efforts in space exploration and discovery.
