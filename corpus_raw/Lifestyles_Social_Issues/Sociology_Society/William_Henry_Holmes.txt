William Henry Holmes,  (born December 1, 1846, near Cadiz, Ohio, U.S.—died April 20, 1933, Royal Oak, Michigan), American archaeologist, artist, and museum director who helped to establish professional archaeology in the United States.
Holmes became interested in geology while serving as an artist on a survey of the Rocky Mountains in 1872. That interest led to archaeology when in 1875 he was working on a geologic exploration of ancient cliff dwellings in southeastern Utah.
In 1883 Holmes published Art in Shell of the Ancient Americans. As curator of anthropology at the Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago (1894–97), he went to the Yucatán Peninsula and produced his superbly illustrated Archaeological Studies Among the Ancient Cities of Mexico (1895–97). He served as curator of anthropology at the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C. (1897–1902 and 1910–20), and was also chief of the institution’s Bureau of American Ethnology (1902–09) and director of the National Gallery of Art (1920–32). Holmes opposed a popular belief that there was a period in New World prehistory comparable to Upper Paleolithic (Old Stone Age) Europe. His other published works include Handbook of Aboriginal American Antiquities (1919).
