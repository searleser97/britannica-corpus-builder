Grace Hoadley Dodge,  (born May 21, 1856, New York, N.Y., U.S.—died Dec. 27, 1914, New York City), American philanthropist who helped form organizations for the welfare of working women in the United States.
Dodge was of a wealthy family long active in philanthropic work. A great-granddaughter of David L. Dodge, New York merchant and peace activist, and granddaughter of William E. Dodge, metals business executive (Phelps, Dodge & Company) and philanthropist, Grace Dodge donated about $1.5 million and years of leadership to her philanthropies. In 1880 she helped form the Kitchen Garden Association (later the Industrial Education Association) to foster manual and domestic training and industrial arts in the public schools. In 1887 she funded the New York College for the Training of Teachers, which became Teachers College in 1892 and subsequently a school of Columbia University.
In 1884 Dodge helped organize a club for working women that eventually developed into the Association of Working Girls’ Societies, a group encompassing some 75 units by 1890. She served as president of that association until 1905, when she mediated the merger of two rival Young Women’s Christian Association groups into the Young Women’s Christian Association (YWCA) of the United States. She served as president of the YWCA board until her death nine years later.
Dodge also organized the New York Travelers’ Aid Society in 1907—a group devoted to the protection of migrant and immigrant women, and in 1912 she led efforts to organize the National Travelers’ Aid Society; she contributed as well to the growth of the international travelers’ aid movement.
