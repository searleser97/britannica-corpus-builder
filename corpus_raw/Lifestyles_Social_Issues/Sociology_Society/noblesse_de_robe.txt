Noblesse de robe,   (French: “Nobility of the Robe”), in 17th- and 18th-century France, a class of hereditary nobles who acquired their rank through holding a high state office. Their name was derived from the robes worn by officials. The class was already in existence by the end of the 16th century, but it was only in the 17th century that its members acquired the right to transmit noble status to their heirs. The period of the 1640s and ’50s was pivotal in the development of the noblesse de robe. In an attempt to bargain for political support during the troubled minority of Louis XIV, the crown granted detailed charters of nobility to judicial officials. At the summit of this newly created privileged class were the officers of such sovereign courts as the Parlement of Paris.
Because of their bourgeois background, the families of the noblesse de robe were at first disdained by nobles who derived their rank from military service (noblesse d’épée) and from long-standing possession (noblesse de race). The distinction between the old and the new aristocracies, between the sword and robe, gradually blurred during the 18th century as both groups worked to defend privilege against attempts at reform by the king. In fact, it was the noblesse de robe that, because of its wealth, its rising social status, and its control of official positions, took the lead in opposition to reform.
