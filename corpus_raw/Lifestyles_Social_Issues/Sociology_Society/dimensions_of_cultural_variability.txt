Dimensions of cultural variability,  a concept that emerged from the work of Dutch social psychologist Geert Hofstede and that refers to the dominant values, principles, beliefs, attitudes, and ethics that are shared by an identifiable group of people that constitute a culture. These dimensions provide the overall framework wherein humans learn to organize their thoughts, emotions, and behaviours in relation to their environment. Over the past few decades, scholars of intercultural communication have isolated several dimensions of cultural variability that can be used to differentiate cultures. They have been labeled as follows: individualism-collectivism, the degree to which personal autonomy is valued over the good of the group; high-low context, in which high context cultures communicate largely through indirect and nonverbal means rather than explicit and direct means, such as written text and speech; power distance, the extent to which less powerful members accept unequal distribution of power or inequality; uncertainty avoidance, a cultureâ€™s level of tolerance for uncertainty and ambiguity; and monochronic-polychronic time orientation, the former being an emphasis on strict adherence to schedules and the completion of tasks and the latter instead stressing human relationships with little regard for punctuality and deadlines. These dimensions of cultural variability are relative and dynamic.
