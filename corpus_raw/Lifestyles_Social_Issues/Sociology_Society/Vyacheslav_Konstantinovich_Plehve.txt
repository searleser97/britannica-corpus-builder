Vyacheslav Konstantinovich Plehve,  Plehve also spelled Pleve,  (born April 20 [April 8, old style], 1846, Kaluga province, Russiaâ€”died  July 28 [July 15, O.S.], 1904, St. Petersburg), Russian imperial statesman whose efforts to uphold autocratic principle, a police-bureaucratic government, and class privilege resulted in the suppression of revolutionary and liberal movements as well as minority nationality groups within the Russian Empire.
Appointed director of the police department in the Ministry of the Interior after the assassination of Emperor Alexander II (1881), Plehve became head of the Imperial Chancellery (1894) and acting minister and state secretary for the Grand Duchy of Finland (1899). In 1902 he became minister of interior. From these positions he obstructed liberal local governmental (zemstvo) activity, harshly pursued Russification policies, particularly against the Armenians and the Finns, and encouraged anti-Semitic propaganda that led to a violent pogrom (April 1903) at Kishinev, now in Moldova. To assuage labour discontent, he backed police-controlled patriotic labour unions. He supported the Russian policy in Korea that provoked conflict with Japan. Plehve was assassinated by a member of the Socialist Revolutionary Party.
