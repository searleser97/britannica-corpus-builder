Pali Text Society,  organization founded with the intention of editing and publishing the texts of the Theravāda canon and its commentaries, as well as producing English translations of many of those texts for an audience of scholars and interested readers. The Pali Text Society (PTS) was established by T.W. Rhys Davids in 1881. The output of the PTS in its early decades was plentiful, issuing editions of dozens of texts by the end of the 19th century. Rhys Davids was succeeded as president by his wife, Caroline, after his death in 1922.
In 1959 I.B. Horner was elected president of the PTS. Horner had worked and produced editions for the PTS since 1942, and the era in which she was president was especially productive and prosperous. Under her leadership the society produced revised editions of older PTS editions that were in need of correction or in need of new translations, and the society also produced editions of other, formerly neglected Pāli texts. Horner died in April 1981. Also in 1981, during its centenary anniversary year, the society completed the reissuing (in eight volumes) of the first issues of the Journal of the Pali Text Society. The society continues to produce issues of the journal periodically as material and resources permit.
In addition to its editions and translations of Pāli primary texts, the PTS has produced introductory works for students on Pāli language and meter, and compiled a Pāli-English dictionary, as well as commencing work on other scholarly volumes, such as the Pāli Tipiṭakaṁ Concordance, intended to serve as an aid to researchers in their work in Theravāda Buddhist studies.
