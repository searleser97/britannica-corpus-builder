American Baptist Association,  fellowship of autonomous Baptist churches, organized in 1905 by Baptists who withdrew from the Southern Baptist Convention. Originally known as the Baptist General Association, the fellowship adopted its present name in 1924. It was a development of the Landmarker (or Landmarkist) teaching of some Southern Baptists in the mid-19th century. They believed that early Christians were Baptists who baptized only adult believers by immersion and who were organized in local autonomous congregations. The Landmarkers wished to retain what they considered the “old landmarks” of early Christianity, and, therefore, they refused to cooperate or associate with non-Baptist churches and other Baptists with whom they disagreed. As the Southern Baptist Convention adopted a more centralized denominational church government, the Landmarkers believed the local church was losing its autonomy, and eventually they withdrew to form their own fellowship.
The American Baptist Association believes in the absolute autonomy of the local congregation. Church doctrine among its members is fundamentalist; a literal interpretation of the Bible is accepted, and the Second Coming of Christ is expected. An annual meeting of the association is held, and an active publications program is carried out. In 2000 it reported 275,000 members in 1,760 congregations. Headquarters are in Texarkana, Texas.
