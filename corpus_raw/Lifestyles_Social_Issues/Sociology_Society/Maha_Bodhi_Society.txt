Maha Bodhi Society,  an organization that was established to encourage Buddhist studies in India and abroad. The society was founded in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) in 1891 by Anagarika Dharmapala; one of its original goals was the restoration of the Mahabodhi temple at Buddh Gaya (Bihar state, India), the site of the Buddhaâ€™s enlightenment, which at that time was in the hands of a Hindu landowner. In 1949 the government of Bihar passed the Buddha-Gaya Temple Act, which entrusted the management of the temple to a committee composed equally of Hindus and Buddhists.
The society has its headquarters in Calcutta and operates centres in several other cities in India and at Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka. An English-language journal, The Maha Bodhi, is published by the society.
