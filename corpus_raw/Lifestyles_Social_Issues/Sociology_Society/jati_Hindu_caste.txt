Jati, also spelled jat,  caste, in Hindu society. The term is derived from the Sanskrit jāta, “born” or “brought into existence,” and indicates a form of existence determined by birth. In Indian philosophy, jati (genus) describes any group of things that have generic characteristics in common. Sociologically, jati has come to be used universally to indicate a caste group among Hindus.
Although the lawgivers of the traditional Hindu codes (Dharma-shastras) themselves tend to treat jatis as varnas (social classes) and try to account on other occasions for jatis as products of alliances between the four varnas (Brahmans, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras) and their descendants, a sharp distinction should be made between jati as a limited regional endogamous group of families and varna as a universal all-Indian model of social class. The official Hindu view gives second place to jati as an aberration of varna.
In different parts of India, certain caste groups have sought respectability within the varna system by claiming membership in a particular varna. Typical and most successful was the claim of the Rajputs that they were the Kshatriyas, or nobles, of the second varna, and, to reinforce their claim, they invented a new lineage (Agnikula, the dynasty of Fire) to coexist side by side with the Solar and Lunar lineages of ancient times. Those people classified among the Scheduled Castes (also called Dalits; formerly “untouchables”) have adopted caste habits of conduct and sought the status of Shudra (the lowest varna) to escape from their pitiable condition.
The very notion of jati has been under attack by reform-minded Indians. They do not always ask for total abolition but frequently advocate a purification of the system by the reabsorption of the jatis into the original, complementarily functioning varnas.
