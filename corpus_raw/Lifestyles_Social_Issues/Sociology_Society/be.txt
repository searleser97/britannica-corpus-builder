Be,  any of the hereditary occupational groups in early Japan (c. 5thâ€“mid-7th century), established to provide specific economic services and a continuous inflow of revenue for the uji, or lineage groups. Each be was thus subsidiary to one of the uji into which all of Japanese society was then divided, and each kakibe, or worker, was effectively owned by the chief of his uji. Most be were agricultural units, producing rice for themselves and their superiors, but some engaged in crafts, fishing, or specific court functions. Those that acted as scribes, interpreters, diviners, or reciters for the court were national organizations; most other types of be were local.
After the Taika-era reforms (ad 645) asserted imperial rule over the various uji, all be were abolished with the exception of those for specially skilled workers such as musicians and craftsmen, whose services were transferred from the imperial family to individual governmental departments.
