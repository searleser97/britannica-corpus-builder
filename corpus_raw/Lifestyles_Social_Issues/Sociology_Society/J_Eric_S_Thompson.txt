Thompson devoted his life to the study of Mayan culture and was able to extensively decipher early Mayan glyphs, determining that, contrary to prevailing belief, they contained historical as well as ritualistic and religious records. He also discovered that present-day Mexican Indians preserve many ancestral customs. His books include The Rise and Fall of Maya Civilization (1954) and Maya History and Religion (1970).
Thompson studied anthropology at the University of Cambridge and, upon graduation, joined the Carnegie Institution excavation in the Yucatán in 1926. He worked with the Carnegie Institution of Washington from 1935 to 1958. His work has been honoured by the governments of Spain and Mexico, and he was the first New World archaeologist to be knighted in Great Britain (1975).
