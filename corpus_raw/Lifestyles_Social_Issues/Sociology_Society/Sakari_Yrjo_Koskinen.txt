Sakari Yrjö-Koskinen, original name Georg Zacharias Forsman,  (born 1830, Vaasa, Fin.—died  Nov. 13, 1903, Helsingfors), historian and politician, author of the first history of Finland in Finnish. Later he guided the Old Finn Party in its policy of compliance with Russia’s unconstitutional Russification program in Finland.
Forsman—later, when he was made a baron, named Yrjö-Koskinen—was a nationalist scholar and a member of the mid-19th-century Fennoman Party, which advocated the development of the Finnish language and its ascendancy over the Swedish of Finland’s dominant minority. In his Suomen kansan historia (1869–72; “Finnish National History”) he demonstrated that Finnish was a suitable language for higher cultural development. Becoming leader of the Fennoman Party in the 1870s, Yrjö-Koskinen entered the Finnish Diet (estates assembly) in 1872 and was appointed to the Senate (the Finnish government) in 1882. Both in the legislative and in the executive bodies he consistently championed the extension of Finnish in all sectors of the grand duchy’s society. With the start of intensive Russification in 1898, the Fennoman Party split into a constitutionalist Young Finn group, which opposed by passive resistance the Russian abrogation of the Finnish constitution, and Yrjö-Koskinen’s Old Finn majority, which chose to comply with the reactionary measures of the imperial government. The Old Finns were rewarded with control of the Senate, of which Yrjö-Koskinen became head, as well as with a declaration of Finnish equality with Swedish in all public business. In the end, however, the policy of the “compliers” proved bankrupt, and Yrjö-Koskinen was subjected to hostile demonstrations in his last days.
