Domestic partnership,  legal or personal recognition of the committed, marriagelike partnership of a couple. Until the late 20th century the term domestic partnership usually referred to heterosexual couples who lived in a relationship like that of a married couple but who chose not to marry. (After a certain period [often a year] in this relationship, their legal rights and responsibilities were typically defined under statutes bearing on common-law marriage.) The term also was applied to any unmarried couple living together in a committed relationship, irrespective of legal rights or responsibilities.
At the end of the 20th century, as many jurisdictions began to codify the rights and responsibilities of those living in committed same-sex relationships, the term was applied as well to those who were prevented by law from marrying. Many jurisdictions allowed same-sex couples—and in some cases heterosexual couples—to register as domestic partners or to form civil unions, which typically provided legal benefits that approached or were equivalent to those of marriage, such as rights of inheritance, hospital visitation, medical decision making, differential taxation, adoption and artificial insemination, employee benefits for spouses and dependents, and others. For fuller treatment of the debates surrounding the legal recognition of such partnerships, see same-sex marriage.
