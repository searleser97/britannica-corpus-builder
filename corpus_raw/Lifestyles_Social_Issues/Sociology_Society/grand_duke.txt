Grand duke, feminine grand duchess, also called (in Russia) grand prince and grand princess,  title of sovereign princes ranking between kings and dukes and of certain members of the Russian imperial family.
The first grand duchy of western Europe was that of Tuscany, the title of grand duke being accorded by Pope Pius V to Cosimo de’ Medici in 1569 and recognized, for Cosimo’s son Francesco, by the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II in 1575. The title passed with Tuscany to the house of Habsburg-Lorraine in the 18th century. The reorganization of Germany and eastern Europe in the period of the Napoleonic Wars gave rise to new grand duchies; the Congress of Vienna respected some of the Napoleonic creations (notably Hesse-Darmstadt and Baden) and created others (including Saxe-Weimar, the two Mecklenburgs [east and west], Luxembourg, and Oldenburg).
The term grand duke is also commonly employed to translate the early Russian title of veliky knyaz, literally “grand prince” (that is, a prince who had other princes subject to him). This title was used beginning with the Kievan princes of the house of Rurik in the 10th century and was gradually assumed by the rulers of other principalities. The style of grand prince was eventually monopolized by the rulers of Muscovy, and from 1547 it was superseded by the title of tsar for the sovereign. Among the Romanovs and especially after the assumption by Peter I the Great of the title imperator (emperor), all descendants of the imperial house of Romanov bore the style veliky knyaz (masculine), or velikaya knyaginya (feminine), until 1886, after which it was reserved for an emperor’s sons, daughters, brothers, sisters, and grandchildren in the male line. The Romanov titles since about 1533 have conventionally been translated as “grand duke” and “grand duchess.”
