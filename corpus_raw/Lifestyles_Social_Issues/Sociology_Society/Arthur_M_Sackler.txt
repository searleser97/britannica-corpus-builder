Arthur M. Sackler, in full Arthur Mitchell Sackler,  (born Aug. 22, 1913, New York, N.Y., U.S.—died  May 26, 1987, New York), American physician, medical publisher, and art collector who made large donations of money and art to universities and museums.
Sackler studied at New York University (B.S., 1933; M.D., 1937) and worked as a psychiatrist at Creedmore State Hospital in Queens, New York (1944–46), where in 1949 he founded the Creedmore Institute of Psychobiological Studies, a field in which he did pioneering research. After 1942 he was also president of William Douglas MacAdams, Inc., a medical advertising agency, and became chairman of its board in 1955. While editor in chief of the Journal of Clinical and Experimental Psychopathology (1950–62) he founded the biweekly Medical Tribune newspaper (1960).
Sackler endowed medical and scientific research at several universities. Meanwhile, he began collecting art in the 1940s, including medieval and post-Impressionist works. His collection of ancient Chinese art became widely known as the world’s largest; in later years he collected pre-Columbian, American Indian, and European art as well. Thousands of his Chinese works were displayed at the Sackler Wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. As a result of his philanthropy, Sackler galleries were added to the Princeton Museum, Columbia University, Harvard University, and the Smithsonian Institution; he also donated art to the Brooklyn Museum, the Museum of American Indian Art, and the archaeological museum at Peking University in China.
