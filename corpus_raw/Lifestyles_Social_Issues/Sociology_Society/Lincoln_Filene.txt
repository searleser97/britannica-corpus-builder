Lincoln Filene, original name Abraham Lincoln Filene,  (born April 5, 1865, Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.—died August 27, 1957, Marstons Mills, Massachusetts), American merchant and philanthropist, chairman of the department store William Filene’s Sons Company in Boston and of the chain of Federated Department Stores.
Filene’s father, William Filene (originally Filehne), founded his speciality store in Boston in 1881 and turned it over to his sons, Edward and Lincoln, in 1891. Lincoln Filene, as chairman (a post he held until the year of his death), handled personnel. He set up an employee organization to arbitrate disputes, introduced a profit-sharing plan in 1903, and introduced a health clinic, insurance, and retirement plans. In 1916 he got other merchants to join in a cooperative Retail Research Organization and later a buying organization, Associated Merchandising Corporation, with contacts worldwide.
In 1929 he led a merger of Filene’s with other department stores in Brooklyn, New York, and Columbus, Ohio, to form the Federated Department Stores. He served as its chairman until shortly before his death in 1957. Filene also engaged in various philanthropic causes, such as creating the Lincoln and Therese Filene Foundation and helping to start Boston’s first educational television station in 1955.
Filene dropped Abraham from his name in 1935.
