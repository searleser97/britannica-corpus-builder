William D.P. Bliss, in full William Dwight Porter Bliss,  (born August 20, 1856, Constantinople [now Istanbul]â€”died October 8, 1926, New York City, New York, U.S.), American social reformer and organizer of Christian Socialist societies.
The son of American missionaries in Turkey, Bliss was educated at the Hartford Theological Seminary (Hartford, Connecticut). First as a Congregationalist and later as an Episcopalian, he held several pastorates following his graduation from Hartford in 1882.
In the late 1880s Bliss became deeply interested in Christian Socialism, a movement intent upon applying the teachings of Jesus to the social dislocations caused by industrialization and urbanization. Bliss organized the first U.S. Christian Socialist Society in 1889 and edited its publication, The Dawn. Bliss traveled extensively, lecturing on the problems of labour and social reform. He compiled and edited many books, the best known being the Encyclopedia of Social Reform (1897). He unsuccessfully ran for lieutenant governor of Massachusetts in 1887 on the Labor Party ticket, and he also served as an investigator for the Bureau of Labor. He did educational work among French and Belgian soldiers interned in Switzerland during World War I. He returned to the United States after the war and preached in New York City until his death.
