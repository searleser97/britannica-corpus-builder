Alfonso Caso y Andrade,  (born Feb. 1, 1896, Mexico City, Mex.—died  Nov. 30, 1970, Mexico City), Mexican archaeologist and government official who explored the early Oaxacan cultures and is best remembered for his excavation of Tomb Seven at Monte Albán, the earliest-known North American necropolis.
Caso y Andrade studied at the University of Mexico and subsequently served on its faculty from 1918 to 1940. He headed the department of archaeology at the National Museum in 1930–33 and was director of the museum itself in 1933–34.
From 1931 to 1943 Caso directed excavations at the site of the ancient Zapotec city of Monte Albán, in Oaxaca state. His discovery and analysis of the burial offerings at the extraordinary Tomb Seven proved that Monte Albán had been occupied by the Mixtec people after they had displaced the Zapotecs in the locality some time before the Spanish conquest. Caso gathered evidence pointing to five major phases in Monte Albán’s history dating back to the 8th century bc, and he was able to establish a rough chronology of that history through correlations with other sites. His other celebrated accomplishment was the deciphering of the Mixtec Codices.
Caso held various posts in the government from 1946, including that of director (1949–70) of the National Institute for Indian Affairs. He is remembered as an advocate for the Indigenista (Indigenismo) movement, which sought greater political and social representation for Mexico’s American Indians in mainstream national life.
