Friends General Conference, in full Religious Society of Friends (General Conference),  continental association of several yearly and monthly meetings of Friends (Quakers) in the United States. It developed from the divisions among the Friends that began in 1827, when the Philadelphia yearly meeting separated into two groups because of theological and social differences. The more liberal Friends were often called Hicksites for one of their leaders, Elias Hicks (1748â€“1830), a liberal Friends minister and leader in the fight to abolish slavery. Other yearly meetings also divided into Hicksite and orthodox groups.
In 1900 seven of the Hicksite yearly meetings joined together to form the Friends General Conference, which has no legislative powers but is concerned with mutual fellowship and cooperation among the meetings. An annual conference is held.
