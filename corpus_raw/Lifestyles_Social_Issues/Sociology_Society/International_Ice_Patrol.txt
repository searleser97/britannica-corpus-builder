International Ice Patrol,   patrol established in 1914 by the agreement of 16 nations with shipping interests in the North Atlantic Ocean after the Titanic collided with an iceberg and sank (1912). The patrol locates icebergs in the North Atlantic, follows and predicts their drift, and issues warnings to ships in the vicinity. Reconnaissance is conducted by the U.S. Coast Guard, using planes equipped with radar that can detect icebergs in all but the roughest sea conditions. The Coast Guard exchanges information with the Canadian Ice Services and also receives reports from passing ships. During the patrol season, which normally extends from March through August, the Coast Guard broadcasts twice daily by Inmarsat satellite and by high-frequency radio facsimile, issuing reports on the locations of all known sea ice and icebergs. Approximately 1,000 icebergs are tracked each year. Destruction of dangerous icebergs has been attempted, but with little success.
