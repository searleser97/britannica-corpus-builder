Braj Bhasha language, also spelled Braj Bhasa, Braj Bhakha, or Brij Bhasa,  language descended from Shauraseni Prakrit and commonly viewed as a western dialect of Hindi. It is spoken by some 575,000 people, primarily in India. Its purest forms are spoken in the cities of Mathura, Agra, Etah, and Aligarh.
Most speakers of Braj Bhasha worship the Hindu deity Krishna. Their bhakti (“devotion”) finds expression in the language, which has a very firm base in folk literature and songs. Almost all of the enactments of episodes from Krishna’s life that are performed during the Janmashtami festival (celebrating Krishna’s birth) are presented in Braj Bhasha.
Through the devotional poetry of the early medieval period (bhakti kal, c. 1450–1700 ce) and the erotic poetry of the late medieval period (riti kal, c. 1700–1850 ce), Braj Bhasha developed a superb literary tradition; its literary form achieved a wider acceptability than any other dialect of Hindi. Among the best-known poets of this language are Mira Bai and Harishchandra.
Braj Bhasha is usually written in the Devanagari script. Its vocabulary contains Sanskrit words in abundance. In terms of grammar, one may contrast between habitual and continuous aspects: compare Braj Bhasha wo jat hae ‘he is going’ (habitual) and wo roje jat hae ‘he goes there everyday’ (continuous) with Awadhi woh jae rau hai ‘he is going’ (both aspects). Gender agreement is also more marked in Braj Bhasha than in Awadhi; compare Braj Bhasha wako chhora ‘his son’ and waki chhori ‘his daughter’ to Awadhi wake larka ‘his son’ and wake larki ‘his daughter.’
