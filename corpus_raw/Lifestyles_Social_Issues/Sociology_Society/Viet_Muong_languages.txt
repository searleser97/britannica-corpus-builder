Viet-Muong languages,  subbranch of the Vietic branch of the Mon-Khmer family of languages, itself a part of the Austroasiatic stock. Vietnamese, the most important language of the group and of the entire Mon-Khmer family, has a number of regional variants. Northern Vietnamese, centred in Hanoi, is the basis for the official form of Vietnamese. Central Vietnamese, centred in Hue, and Southern Vietnamese, centred in Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon), differ from the Northern norm in having fewer tones and in modifying certain consonants. All three use the same writing system, which is called Quoc-ngu. The dialects spoken in the city of Vinh and in much of Nghe An province are more divergent. Vietnamese has borrowed liberally from Chinese over the centuries. This vocabulary, which has now diverged from the original Chinese source, is sometimes called Sino-Vietnamese. Muong, the other language of the group, is spoken in northern Vietnam; it differs from Vietnamese primarily in showing far less Chinese influence.
