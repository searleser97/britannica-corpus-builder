Amharic language, also called Amarinya or Kuchumba, Amarinya also spelled Amharinya and Amarigna,  one of the two main languages of Ethiopia (along with the Oromo language). It is spoken principally in the central highlands of the country. Amharic is an Afro-Asiatic language of the Southwest Semitic group and is related to Geʿez, or Ethiopic, the liturgical language of the Ethiopian Orthodox church; it also has affinities with Tigré, Tigrinya, and the South Arabic dialects.
Although the oldest extant records in Amharic are songs and poems dating from the 14th century ce, significant literature in any quantity did not begin until the 19th century.
Amharic is written in a slightly modified form of the alphabet used for writing the Geʿez language. There are 33 basic characters, each of which has seven forms depending on which vowel is to be pronounced in the syllable. Amharic has been strongly influenced by the Cushitic languages, especially Oromo and the Agaw languages. The dialects of Amharic are not strongly differentiated from one another. Some 18.7 million people spoke Amharic in the early 21st century.
