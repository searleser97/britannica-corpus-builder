William Bramwell Booth,  (born March 8, 1856, Halifax, Yorkshire, Eng.—died  June 16, 1929, London), second general of the Salvation Army (1912–29) and eldest son of William and Catherine Booth.
He became an active full-time collaborator in 1874 and, from 1880, was the Army’s chief organizer. He carried into practice the social services plans outlined by his father. In 1885, together with William Thomas Stead, he stood trial at the Old Bailey on a technical charge connected with the successful attempt to secure legislation protecting young girls in moral danger, but he was acquitted. The trial—and Stead’s vigorous press campaign—proved to a skeptical public that in 19th-century England girls could be bought and sold for immoral purposes, not only without their consent but against their will. An able speaker and a tireless exponent of the doctrine of Christian perfection, he published nine books, of which Echoes and Memories (1925) and These Fifty Years (1929) are perhaps the best known. William Bramwell Booth was also an enthusiast for religious work among young people. He became general on his father’s death.
