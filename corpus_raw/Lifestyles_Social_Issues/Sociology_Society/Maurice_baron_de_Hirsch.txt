Maurice, baron de Hirsch, (French), German in full Moritz, Freiherr (baron) von Hirsch auf Gereuth,  (born Dec. 9, 1831, Munich, Bavaria [Germany]—died April 21, 1896, Érsekújvár, Hung.), Jewish businessman noted for his extensive philanthropy.
Born into a wealthy family, Hirsch increased his inheritance by his business acumen at the international banking house of Bischoffsheim and Goldschmidt, of Paris and London, and by financial speculations, beginning with the successful construction of a railway through the Balkans to Constantinople. He began his philanthropic activities by aiding Oriental Jews, whose poverty struck him while he was on a visit to Turkey. To aid them, he contributed 1,000,000 francs to the Alliance Israélite Universelle, a philanthropic organization, and subsequently maintained it with large annual donations. He then established and richly endowed the Jewish Colonization Association, with headquarters in England. This fund, which became one of the largest charitable trusts in the world, was used to establish agricultural colonies in hospitable countries, for Hirsch believed that Jews would best become self-supporting by farming.
In 1891 Hirsch founded and endowed the Baron de Hirsch fund in the United States, principally to help Jewish immigrants there to learn a trade. In the late 20th century the fund continued to support the Jewish Agricultural Society, which lent money to farmers and settled displaced persons on farms in various countries. Hirsch’s charity was not confined to Jews, and it has been estimated that he spent more than $100,000,000 on his philanthropies.
