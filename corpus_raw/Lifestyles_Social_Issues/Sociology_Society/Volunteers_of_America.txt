Volunteers of America,   religious social-welfare organization in the United States that offers spiritual and material aid to those in need. It was founded in New York City in 1896 by Ballington and Maud Booth as a result of a schism in the Salvation Army and is organized along quasi-military lines. The Grand Field Council, made up of all officers of the rank of lieutenant major or higher, is the chief governing body. It elects the commander in chief and other administrative officers.
Through more than 800 service centres the organization offers a broad variety of welfare services, including day nurseries, homes and clubs for the aged, summer camps for children and adults, maternity homes for unwed mothers, aid to convicts and former convicts and their families, salvage and rehabilitation programs for the physically and mentally handicapped, residences for girls, emergency shelters for women and children, and family centres. Its spiritual services include mission churches and Sunday schools, in which a conservative interpretation of the Christian faith is presented.
Local administration is performed by a resident officer aided by an advisory board of local citizens. Funds are provided by direct public contribution and through the local federated fund. Headquarters are in New York City.
