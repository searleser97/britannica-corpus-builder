Songhai languages, Songhai also spelled Songhay,  group of closely related languages generally assumed to constitute the primary branch of the Nilo-Saharan language family. The Songhai languages are spoken mainly along the Niger River, from Djenn√© and Timbuktu in Mali eastward as far as Benin, with extensions into adjacent countries. At least six varieties are usually distinguished, although the question of how many distinct Songhai languages should be recognized is undecided. With two million speakers, Zarma ranks among the major languages of Africa in terms of number of speakers. The other five major Songhai languages together have more than one million speakers: Western Songhai (with Djenne Chiini and Koyra Chiini as main varieties), Central Songhai (with Humburi Senni and Kaado as main varieties), Eastern Songhai (Koyraboro Senni), Dendi, and Tadaksahak.
