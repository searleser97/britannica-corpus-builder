Chōnin,   (Japanese: “townsman”), class of townsmen that emerged in Japan during the early years of the Tokugawa period (1603–1867) and became an influential and prosperous sector of society.
So named because of their residence in city wards (chō), the chōnin were generally merchants, though occasionally craftsmen and artisans were included in their number. In spite of compulsory loans, property confiscations, and legislation designed to restrict their wealth, the chōnin multiplied rapidly during the Tokugawa period, and their prosperity contrasted greatly with the financial straits of the peasant and samurai classes, who became heavily indebted to the chōnin. This resulted in considerable resentment and discontent, for which the government was often blamed.
Under chōnin sponsorship, advances were made in the fields of astronomy, agronomy, medicine, and civil engineering in Japan. Moreover, a distinct chōnin culture developed in the major Japanese cities, especially during the Genroku (1688–1703) and Bunka-Bunsei (1804–29) periods. Characterized by conspicuous consumption, this culture led to the development of new art forms such as haiku poetry, kabuki and jōruri theatre, and erotic novels and short stories. It also involved the extensive use of female entertainers and courtesans, such as geisha, who first came into prominence at this time.
Unlike their Western contemporaries, the chōnin never emancipated themselves from dependence on government sponsorship. When freed of governmental interference and allowed to develop independently after the Meiji Restoration, the 1868 overthrow of feudal rule, the chōnin class gradually declined. Samurai entrepreneurs generally replaced chōnin as leaders of the business community.
