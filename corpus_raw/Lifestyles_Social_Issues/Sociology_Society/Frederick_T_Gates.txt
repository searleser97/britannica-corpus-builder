Frederick T. Gates, in full Frederick Taylor Gates,  (born July 2, 1853, Maine, N.Y., U.S.—died  Feb. 6, 1929, Phoenix, Ariz.), American philanthropist and businessman, a major figure in the Rockefeller interests, who spearheaded the endowment drive that created the University of Chicago.
During his college days at the University of Rochester, N.Y., Gates worked as a bank clerk. His undergraduate studies were followed by three years at the Rochester Theological Seminary and his ordination as a Baptist minister. After eight years as a clergyman, Gates resigned to help raise $50,000 for the Pillsbury Academy. For this work, he was made corresponding secretary of the American Baptist Education Society and focused his efforts on establishing religious schools throughout the United States. Recognizing a need for a major Baptist university in the Midwest, Gates began a publicity and fund-raising campaign that won the approval of John D. Rockefeller, Sr. In 1889 Rockefeller made an initial gift of $600,000, and the University of Chicago opened its doors in 1892.
Gates then went to work for Rockefeller and was entrusted with directing the oilman’s vast philanthropic contributions. He also served as an astute business and financial adviser to many of Rockefeller’s businesses, including railroads, mines, and manufacturing plants. Gates was the organizer and director of the Lake Superior Consolidated Iron Mine until it was sold to United States Steel in 1900 for $75,000,000. He organized and served as president of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research and also played an important role in the creation of the Rockefeller Foundation.
