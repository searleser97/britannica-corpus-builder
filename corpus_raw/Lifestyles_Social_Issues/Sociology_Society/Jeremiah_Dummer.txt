Jeremiah Dummer,  (born 1681, Boston, Massachusetts—died May 19, 1739, Plaistow, Essex, England), British-American colonial agent, author, and benefactor of Yale College.
Jeremiah Dummer, the son of Jeremiah Dummer, Sr., a prosperous Boston silversmith and engraver, graduated from Harvard University in 1699 and afterward studied in Holland and received a doctorate from the University of Utrecht in 1703. He returned to Boston but was unsuccessful in efforts to obtain a prestigious Congregational pulpit or a professorship at Harvard.
Dummer traveled to England in 1708 to defend Massachusetts’ claim to Martha’s Vineyard. In London he engaged in commercial enterprises and wrote a royalist political polemic. Near the end of 1710, Governor Joseph Dudley appointed him colonial agent for Massachusetts. Two years later he was also made Connecticut’s agent in England.
Dummer has been considered one of the best colonial agents prior to Benjamin Franklin. He laboured diligently to promote and protect the interests of the colonies he represented before the British government. His most notable action was his A Defence of the New-England Charters, a work written in 1715. This pamphlet used Lockean precepts to argue against any alterations of existing New England charter rights, after they had been attacked in Parliament. The work was later praised by John Adams, who called it “one of our most classical American productions.” As agent, Dummer also was quite active in securing books and patrons for the Collegiate School of Connecticut. The school was later named for his principal patron, Elihu Yale. Dummer’s political fortunes began to decline after 1714, and the Massachusetts lower house voted to discontinue his services in 1721. He remained Connecticut’s agent until 1730; he then retired to Plaistow, near London.
