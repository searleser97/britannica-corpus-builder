Tasmanian languages,  extinct languages spoken before 1877 by the Tasmanian Aboriginal people (Palawa) of Tasmania. No relationship between the Tasmanian languages and any other languages of the world has been demonstrated, and it is unclear whether all the Tasmanian languages themselves are in fact related to one another. Scholars originally divided the Tasmanian languages into two groups: a western group, spoken in western Tasmania and northern Tasmania, and an eastern group, containing the three languages of eastern Tasmania. More recent studies suggest that there may have been 8 to 12 languages. An effort has been underway since the 1990s to revive the languages in the form of a single dialect, known as Palawa Kani, which has been stitched together from remnants of the earlier languages.
