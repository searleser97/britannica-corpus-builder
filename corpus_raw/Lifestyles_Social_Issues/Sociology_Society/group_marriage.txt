Group marriage,   the marriage of several men with several women. As an institutionalized social practice, group marriage is extremely rare; nowhere does it appear to have existed as the prevailing form of marital arrangement. Of the 250 societies reported by the American anthropologist George P. Murdock (1949), only the Caingang of Brazil had chosen group marriage as an alternative form of union; even there the frequency was but 8 percent.
At the turn of the century, many anthropologists believed that in an early stage of human development group marriage was common. Much of the literature of that time attempted to demonstrate that marital unions had undergone several evolutionary stages, beginning with complete sexual license, through group marriage, polygyny, and polyandry, and culminating in monogamy. Group marriage was erroneously ascribed to peoples in Australia, Siberia, and Africa, when in actuality the particular tribes contained groups of men who had privileged sexual access to women but did not bear the domestic and economic responsibilities that constitute a true marriage.
Such evolutionary theories were for the most part discarded by later anthropologists, and a more representative opinion regarded group marriage as a sporadic and rare phenomenon always appearing in conjunction with polyandry. It is possible that group marriage can only occur when polyandrous marriage is common and then combines with polygyny. One motive for group marriage seems to be enhanced economic security through mate recruitment. In the West, group marriage has been the object of occasional theoretical treatises and practical experiments by utopian movements.
