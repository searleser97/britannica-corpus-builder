James Buchanan Brady, byname Diamond Jim Brady,  (born Aug. 12, 1856, New York City—died  April 13, 1917, Atlantic City, N.J., U.S.), American financier and philanthropist, noted for his lavish lifestyle, fondness for ostentatious jewelry, and enormous appetite.
Brady worked as a bellhop and in various jobs with the New York Central Railroad before taking a sales position with a railroad supply house. An extremely successful salesman, he drew huge commissions and soon was a multimillionaire. As his wealth increased, so did his generosity and his penchant for the good life. He handed out cash liberally and forgave debts freely. He invested much of his fortune in jewelry, mostly diamonds. Rarely seen in public without one or more of his great gems prominently displayed, he thus acquired the nickname “Diamond Jim” and became a legendary and popular figure in New York City. He was equally famous for his seemingly insatiable capacity for food, an appetite that he freely indulged at grand feasts.
In 1912 he donated funds to Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore for the establishment of a medical institute. He also bequeathed a large sum to New York Hospital.
