Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC),  governmental regulating body for the Indian filmmaking industry. Popularly known as the Censor Board, the CBFC was set up under the Cinematograph Act of 1952. Its purpose is to certify, by means of screening and rating, the suitability of feature films, short films, trailers, documentaries, and theatre-based advertising for public viewing. In the early 21st century the CBFC previewed some 13,500 items per year. The board assigns each film to one of four categories: U for unrestricted public exhibition, A for adults only, UA for films requiring parental guidance for children under age 12, and S for exhibition to a restricted audience (for instance, doctors). All films—foreign and Indian, as well as versions released in different formats—must obtain CBFC certification before being screened or broadcast in India.
Headed by a chairperson (usually a notable figure from the arts and entertainment area) and a team of 25 administrative members, the Mumbai-based CBFC operates through nine regional offices, located in New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Thiruvananthapuram, Guwahati, and Cuttack in addition to Mumbai. Each of those offices has created a locally appointed advisory panel composed of individuals from different walks of life who serve for terms of varying lengths. Although the CBFC does not include an enforcement agency, its directives generally have been accepted—often under protest—by filmmakers unwilling to risk complete prohibition by local authorities.
