Franklin H. Giddings, in full Franklin Henry Giddings,  (born March 23, 1855, Sherman, Connecticut, U.S.—died  June 11, 1931, Scarsdale, New York), one of the scholars responsible for transforming American sociology from a branch of philosophy into a research science utilizing statistical and analytic methodology.
Giddings was noted for his doctrine of the “consciousness of kind,” which he derived from Adam Smith’s conception of “sympathy,” or shared moral reactions. In Giddings’s view, consciousness of kind fostered a homogeneous society and resulted from the interaction of individuals and their exposure to common stimuli. Some critics regarded consciousness of kind as a euphemism for the herd instinct.
As a journalist in Springfield, Massachusetts, Giddings attracted attention with his writings on the social sciences. He succeeded Woodrow Wilson as professor of politics at Bryn Mawr College (Pennsylvania) in 1888 and was professor of sociology at Columbia University from 1894 to 1928. In addition to Smith’s concept of sympathy, Auguste Comte’s positivism and Herbert Spencer’s social Darwinism influenced Giddings’s sociology. His books include The Principles of Sociology (1896); Studies in the Theory of Human Society (1922), considered the best statement of his matured ideas; and The Scientific Study of Human Society (1924).
