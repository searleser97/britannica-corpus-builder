Uzbek language,  member of the Turkic language family within the Altaic language group, spoken in Uzbekistan, eastern Turkmenistan, northern and western Tajikistan, southern Kazakhstan, northern Afghanistan, and northwestern China. Uzbek belongs to the southeastern, or Chagatai, branch of the Turkic languages.
In Uzbek roughly two main dialect groups can be distinguished. One includes the southern, or Iranized, dialects (Tashkent, Bukhara, Samarkand) and the semi-Iranized dialects (Fergana, Kokand), which, owing to the influence of the Tajik language, have modified the typical Turkic feature of vowel harmony. The other group comprises the northern Uzbek dialects in southern Kazakhstan and several dialects in the region of Khiva. These dialects show much less Iranian influence. (Kipchak-Uzbek is practically a dialect of the Kazak language.) In the creation of a new literary language after the Russian Revolution of 1917, a dominant role was first played by the northern dialects and later by the southern dialects. The latter serve as the basis of the current literary language. Uzbek has been written in the Arabic, Latin, and Cyrillic scripts. In 1993 the government of Uzbekistan officially reinstated a modified Latin alphabet for the Uzbek language.
