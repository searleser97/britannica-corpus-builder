Blue law,  in U.S. history, a law forbidding certain secular activities on Sunday. The name may derive from Samuel A. Peters’s General History of Connecticut (1781), which purported to list the stiff Sabbath regulations at New Haven, Connecticut; the work was printed on blue paper. A more probable derivation is based on an 18th-century usage of the word blue meaning “rigidly moral” in a disparaging sense. Strictest in Puritan, Bible-oriented communities, blue laws usually forbade regular work on Sunday, plus any buying, selling, traveling, public entertainment, or sports. Peters’s account of the New Haven Puritan government’s codes has been proved unreliable. Among the 45 blue laws he listed in his History (1781) that were wholly or substantially true, however, are the following: “The judges shall determine controversies without a jury”; “married persons must live together or be imprisoned”; “a wife shall be good evidence against her husband”; and “the selectmen, on finding children ignorant, may take them away from their parents and put them into better hands, at the expense of their parents.” To some degree, similar laws existed in all the American colonies. In general, they lapsed after the American Revolution. However, blue laws, especially those regarding the sale of alcohol, remained on the statutes in some states into the 21st century, and their influence persisted wherever public activity on Sunday was regulated.
