Vaishya, also spelled Vaisya,  third highest in ritual status of the four varnas, or social classes, of Hindu India, traditionally described as commoners. Legend states that the varnas (or colours) sprang from Prajapati, a creator god—in order of status, the Brahman (white) from his head, the Kshatriya (red) from his arms, the Vaishya (yellow) from his thighs, and the Shudra (black) from his feet. The yellow colour associated with the Vaishyas, according to one theory, links them with the south point of the compass. The Vaishyas were commoners, not servile groups. Their role lay in productive labour, in agricultural and pastoral tasks, and in trading. Their way of life demanded study, sacrifice, and the giving of alms. Early scriptures show that a Vaishya could and did rise even to the rank of Brahman, as in the case of the two sons of Nabhagarishta, mentioned in the sacred work Harivamsha.
The Vaishyas share with the two higher classes, the priestly Brahmans and the authoritative Kshatriyas, the distinction of being dvija, or “twice-born,” achieving their spiritual rebirth when they assume the sacred wool thread at the upanayana ceremony. The Vaishyas are credited in history with favouring the rise of the reformist religious beliefs of Buddhism and Jainism.
