Anne Parrish,  (born Oct. 17, 1760, Philadelphia, Pa. [U.S.]â€”died Dec. 26, 1800, Philadelphia),  American philanthropist whose school for indigent girls, founded in the late 18th century, existed well into the 20th.
Parrish grew up in a Quaker home where charitable works were greatly valued. When her parents fell victim to the yellow fever epidemic of 1793, she vowed that if they recovered she would devote the rest of her life to philanthropy. They did recover, and she was true to her vow.
In 1795 Parrish established the House of Industry to supply employment to poor women in Philadelphia. It was the first charitable organization for women in the United States. The following year she founded a school for needy girls that was later called the Aimwell School. It quickly proved a success, and within three years Parrish had hired several teachers to assist her with some 50 pupils. Courses in regular school subjects were supplemented by training in domestic skills. Over the years the school moved several times to larger quarters, and it remained in operation until 1923.
