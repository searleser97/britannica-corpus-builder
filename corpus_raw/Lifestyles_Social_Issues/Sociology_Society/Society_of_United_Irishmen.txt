Society of United Irishmen,  Irish political organization formed in October 1791 by Theobald Wolfe Tone, James Napper Tandy, and Thomas Russell to achieve Roman Catholic emancipation and (with Protestant cooperation) parliamentary reform. British attempts to suppress the society caused its reorganization as an underground movement dedicated to securing complete Irish independence. In April 1794 the society opened negotiations with Revolutionary France for military aid, but the British government soon learned of the activity. Twice in 1796â€“97 French expeditionary forces failed to reach Ireland. Still anticipating help from France, the United Irishmen made plans for a rebellion in 1798. The principal conspirators were arrested in advance of the uprising, and the meagre aid provided by France came too late to be effective. Only in County Wexford did the rebels make any gains, but they were unable to hold the area, and the rebellion collapsed.
