Amateur Athletic Association (AAA),  British national governing organization for the sport of track and field (athletics). Founded in 1880, it took over as the governing power from the Amateur Athletic Club, founded in 1866. The association was the first such organization in the world. The AAA was one of the first groups to reject the requirement of upper-class background that had previously been necessary to achieve amateur athletic status.
The AAA promotes, organizes, and regulates athletic competition, coaching, and training and holds annual national and junior national championships. Association headquarters is in London.
