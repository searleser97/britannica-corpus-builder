MacArthur Foundation, in full the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation,  private, independent foundation established in 1970 by philanthropists John and Catherine MacArthur. The MacArthur Foundation’s mission is to “support creative people and effective institutions committed to building a more just, verdant, and peaceful world.” Based in Chicago, the foundation also has offices in India, Mexico, Nigeria, and Russia.
Four foundation programs grant funding: International Programs; U.S. Programs; Media, Culture, and Special Initiatives; and the MacArthur Fellows Program. The areas supported through the foundation’s International Programs and U.S. Programs include, but are not limited to, human rights, education, peace and security, conservation, community and economic development, juvenile justice reform, and digital and media learning. The Media, Culture, and Special Initiatives program funds news and documentary journalism throughout the United States as well as arts organizations in Chicago.
The MacArthur Fellows Program is the foundation’s most-recognized avenue of funding. It annually awards “genius grants” to a group of 20 to 30 talented, innovative, and creative individuals from a broad range of fields. Each fellow receives an unrestricted stipend that is distributed over the course of five years.
The MacArthurs’ wealth was derived from the Bankers Life and Casualty Company of Chicago—which, at the time of John’s death in 1978, was the largest privately owned insurance company in the United States—as well as many other companies, banks, radio and television stations, a hotel, and apartment and office buildings. Catherine, who died in 1981, was intimately involved in their business affairs, often appearing in company records under her maiden name, C.T. Hyland. In 1978 the Bankers Life and Casualty Company stock was placed in a trust to fund the foundation’s activities. Funding decisions are made by the trust’s board of directors.
