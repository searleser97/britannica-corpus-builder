Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), also called (after 1969) Student National Coordinating Committee,  American political organization that played a central role in the civil rights movement in the 1960s. Begun as an interracial group advocating nonviolence, it adopted greater militancy late in the decade, reflecting nationwide trends in Black activism.
The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee was founded in early 1960 in Raleigh, North Carolina, to capitalize on the success of a surge of sit-ins in Southern college towns, where Black students refused to leave restaurants in which they were denied service based on their race. This form of nonviolent protest brought SNCC to national attention, throwing a harsh public light on white racism in the South. In the years following, SNCC strengthened its efforts in community organization and supported Freedom Rides in 1961, along with the March on Washington in 1963, and agitated for the Civil Rights Act (1964). In 1966 SNCC officially threw its support behind the broader protest of the Vietnam War.
As SNCC became more active politically, its members faced increased violence. In response, SNCC migrated from a philosophy of nonviolence to one of greater militancy after the mid-1960s, as an advocate of the burgeoning “Black power” movement, a facet of late 20th-century Black nationalism. The shift was personified by Stokely Carmichael, who replaced John Lewis as SNCC chairman in 1966–67. While many early SNCC members were white, the newfound emphasis on African American identity led to greater racial separatism, which unnerved portions of the white community. More-radical elements of SNCC, such as Carmichael’s successor H. Rap Brown, gravitated toward new groups, such as the Black Panther Party. SNCC was disbanded by the early 1970s.
Other notable figures in SNCC included Ella Baker, Julian Bond, Rubye Robinson, and Fannie Lou Hamer.
