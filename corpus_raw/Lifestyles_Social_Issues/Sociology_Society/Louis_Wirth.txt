Louis Wirth,  (born Aug. 28, 1897, Gemünden, Ger.—died  May 3, 1952, Buffalo, N.Y., U.S.), American sociologist who pioneered in the study of urban problems.
A noted teacher at the University of Chicago from 1926, Wirth blended empirical research and theory in his work and contributed to the emergence of sociology as a profession. Wirth was president (1947) of the American Sociological Society and first president (1949–52) of the International Sociological Association.
He was the chief author of Our Cities: Their Role in the National Economy (1937). Written in the name of the U.S. National Resources Committee, this volume was an important early attempt to outline a national urban policy based on the findings of the social sciences. He also wrote The Ghetto (1928); “Urbanism as a Way of Life” (1938), an article published in the American Journal of Sociology that became a classic; and many other papers, collected in Community Life and Social Policy (1956) and Louis Wirth on Cities and Social Life (1964).
