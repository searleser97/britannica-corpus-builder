Mahar,  caste-cluster, or group of many endogamous castes, living chiefly in Maharashtra state, India, and in adjoining states. They mostly speak Marathi, the official language of Maharashtra. In the early 1980s the Mahar community was believed to constitute about 9 percent of the total population of Maharashtra—by far the largest, most widespread, and most important of all the region’s officially designated Scheduled Castes (people of the lowest social class, who had been branded “untouchable” before the Constitution of 1949 outlawed discrimination against them).
Traditionally, the Mahar lived on the outskirts of villages and performed a number of duties for the entire village. Their duties included those of village watchman, messenger, wall mender, adjudicator of boundary disputes, street sweeper, and remover of carcasses. They also worked as agricultural labourers and held some land, though they were not primarily farmers. In the mid-20th century, the Mahar began to migrate in large numbers to urban centres (e.g., Mumbai [Bombay], Nagpur, Pune [Poona], and Sholapur), where they were employed as masons, industrial labourers, railway workers, mechanics, and bus and truck drivers.
The Mahar were unified by the eminent 20th-century leader Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, who urged them to militant political consciousness and to great educational improvement. Before his death in 1956, Ambedkar and hundreds of thousands of his Mahar followers converted to Buddhism in protest against their Hindu caste status.
