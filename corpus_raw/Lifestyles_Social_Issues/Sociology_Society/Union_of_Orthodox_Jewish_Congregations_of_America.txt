Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America,  official federation of Jewish Orthodox synagogues in the United States and Canada; its counterpart organization for rabbis is the Rabbinical Council of America.
The union was established in New York City in 1898 to foster Orthodox beliefs and practices. To pursue its goals, the union sponsors numerous elementary and secondary day schools oriented toward Orthodoxy and supports some 15 Orthodox institutes of higher learning (yeshivas). It also publishes the quarterly Perakim and two bi-monthlies, Jewish Life and Jewish Action. The union’s main auxiliary unit, Women’s Branch (established 1924), publishes Hachodesh and operates the Hebrew Teachers Training School for Girls. The National Conference of Synagogue Youth was set up in 1954. Many manufactured foods that meet the requirements of Jewish dietary laws (kashrut) bear the union’s mark of approval.
