A.R. Radcliffe-Brown, in full Alfred Reginald Radcliffe-Brown,  (born Jan. 17, 1881, Birmingham, Warwick, Eng.—died  Oct. 24, 1955, London), English social anthropologist of the 20th century who developed a systematic framework of concepts and generalizations relating to the social structures of preindustrial societies and their functions. He is widely known for his theory of functionalism and his role in the founding of British social anthropology.
Radcliffe-Brown went to the Andaman Islands (1906–08), where his fieldwork won him a fellowship at Trinity College, Cambridge. On an expedition to Western Australia (1910–12), he concentrated on kinship and family organization. He became director of education for the kingdom of Tonga (1916) and served as professor of social anthropology at the University of Cape Town (1920–25), where he founded the School of African Life and Languages. His study The Andaman Islanders (1922; new ed. 1964) contained the essential formulation of his ideas and methods.
At the University of Sydney (1925–31) he developed a vigorous teaching program involving research in theoretical and applied anthropology. His theory had its classic formulation and application in The Social Organisation of Australian Tribes (1931). Treating all Aboriginal Australia known at the time, the work cataloged, classified, analyzed, and synthesized a vast amount of data on kinship, marriage, language, custom, occupancy and possession of land, sexual patterns, and cosmology. He attempted to explain social phenomena as enduring systems of adaptation, fusion, and integration of elements. He held that social structures are arrangements of persons and that organizations are the arrangements of activities; thus, the life of a society may be viewed as an active system of functionally consistent, interdependent elements.
At the University of Chicago (1931–37) Radcliffe-Brown was instrumental in introducing social anthropology to American scholars. Returning to England in 1937, he joined the faculty of the University of Oxford (1937–46). His later works include Structure and Function in Primitive Society (1952), Method in Social Anthropology (1958), and an edited collection of essays entitled African Systems of Kinship and Marriage (1950), which remains a landmark in African studies.
