Southeastern Conference (SEC),  American collegiate athletic association that grew out of the Southern Conference. Members are the University of Alabama, the University of Arkansas (Fayetteville), Auburn University, the University of Florida, the University of Georgia, the University of Kentucky, Louisiana State University, the University of Mississippi, Mississippi State University, the University of South Carolina, the University of Tennessee, Vanderbilt University, the University of Missouri, and Texas A&M University. The University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee, an original member, dropped out of the conference in 1940, and both the Georgia Institute of Technology and Tulane University left in the 1960s. The conference was formed in 1932 when its members left the 11-year-old Southern Conference, believing that it had grown too large for competitive balance. In 1935 the SEC was the first conference to authorize athletic scholarships, and it led the movement in the National Collegiate Athletic Association to make this common practice in the 1950s. In 1992 Arkansas and South Carolina joined the conference, which was then organized into two divisions of six teams each, and with the additions of Missouri and Texas A&M in 2012, the divisions were expanded to seven teams.
