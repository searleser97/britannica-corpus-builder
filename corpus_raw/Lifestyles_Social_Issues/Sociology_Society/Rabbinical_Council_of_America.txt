Rabbinical Council of America,   organization of Orthodox rabbis, almost all of whom have received their rabbinical training in the United States. The councilâ€™s chief aims have been to promote the study and practice of Orthodox Judaism, to defend the basic rights of Jews in all parts of the world, and to support the State of Israel. It is the rabbinical arm of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, with which it supervises the manufacture of kosher foods.
Originally organized in 1923 as the Rabbinical Council of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations, the council adopted its present name in the 1930s after merging (1936) with the Rabbinical Association of the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary (now Yeshiva University), in New York City. The Alumni Association of Hebrew Theological College of Chicago (now in Skokie, Ill.) joined the council in 1943.
The council publishes two journals, the semiannual Hebrew-language Hadorom and the quarterly English-language Tradition. In 1960 it sponsored the publication of The Traditional Prayer Book for Sabbath and Festivals.
