Halston, byname of Roy Halston Frowick,  (born April 23, 1932, Des Moines, Iowa, U.S.—died March 26, 1990, San Francisco, California), American designer of elegant fashions with a streamlined look. He was widely considered the first superstar designer in the United States, and his clothing defined 1970s American fashion.
Halston studied at Indiana University and the Art Institute of Chicago and operated a millinery shop in Chicago before joining milliner Lilly Daché in New York City. In 1959 he became a milliner for Bergdorf Goodman. In 1966 he expanded his line into clothes, and in 1968 he began his own couture house, which catered to celebrities. Halston won the Coty American Fashion Critics “Winnie” awards for having the most influence on fashion in 1971 and 1972. His famous clientele included Liza Minnelli and Elizabeth Taylor, and his clothing became associated with discotheques, especially Studio 54, where the designer was a frequent guest.
In 1973 Halston sold his business to the Norton Simon conglomerate for $16 million but continued as principal designer. He later signed (1982) a contract to design an affordable clothing line for the mass retailer J.C. Penney. Although such deals subsequently became common in the fashion industry, it was unprecedented at the time and severely damaged his career. In 1984 he was fired from his namesake business, and, beginning that year, he tried unsuccessfully to buy back the company.
Halston’s simple yet chic designs included Ultrasuede shirtwaist dresses, tailored suits, traditional chiffon and crepe evening dresses, cashmere sweater sets, tunics, slinky halter dresses, and knitted cape-stoles. His later creations were limited to costumes for Martha Graham’s dance company.
In 1990 Halston moved to San Francisco, and later that year he died from AIDS-related complications. The documentary Halston was released in 2019.
