Sol Tax,  (born Oct. 30, 1907, Chicago, Ill., U.S.—died  Jan. 4, 1995, Chicago), American cultural anthropologist who founded the journal Current Anthropology. He was also known for the Fox Project, a study of the culture of the Fox and Sauk Indians.
Tax received his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago (1935), where he was a professor from 1944 until his retirement. He pioneered the use of “transactional analysis” in his study of the Omaha kinship pattern among the Fox. During his work with the Fox (Mesquakie) Indians from 1948 to 1962, he became convinced that the influence of the anthropologist’s presence among them deserved not only to be further studied but to be directed toward the benefit of the native peoples. His work led him to champion what he called “action anthropology,” directed at enabling communities to accomplish their goals as well as to work to develop a pan-tribal organization and to help Native American peoples to preserve their cultural identity.
Throughout his career Tax participated in numerous anthropological societies. In 1959 he served as president of the American Anthropological Association. Tax was founder and, from 1960 to 1974, general editor of Current Anthropology: A World Journal of the Sciences of Man; he established the journal as a means of international communication among anthropologists during the Cold War. He also helped coordinate and served as chairman of the National Anthropology Film Center. Among the publications that he edited are Heritage of Conquest: The Ethnology of Middle America (1952), An Appraisal of Anthropology Today (1953), Evolution after Darwin, 3 vol. (1960), Anthropology Today—Selections (1962), and Horizons of Anthropology (1964).
