Die Blaue Vier, (German: “The Blue Four”)  successor group of Der Blaue Reiter (“The Blue Rider”; 1911–14), formed in 1924 in Germany by the Russian artists Alexey von Jawlensky and Wassily Kandinsky, the Swiss artist Paul Klee, and the American-born artist Lyonel Feininger. At the time of the group’s formation, Kandinsky, Klee, and Feininger were teaching at the Weimar Bauhaus.
Members of the group were united by a desire to exhibit together rather than by similarity of style. Between 1925 and 1934 exhibitions of their work were mounted in the United States, Mexico, and Germany.
