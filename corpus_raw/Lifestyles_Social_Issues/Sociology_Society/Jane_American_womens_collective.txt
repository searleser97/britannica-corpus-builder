Jane,  Chicago-based women’s collective that provided more than 11,000 safe albeit illegal abortions between 1969 and 1973. The underground clinic, a small branch of the Chicago Women’s Liberation Union, strove to strengthen the pro-choice movement and abolish expensive, unsafe, and callously performed abortion services. They did so by providing medically sound, low-cost abortions at $100 or less, which was significantly cheaper than the standard costs, then ranging from $400 to $1,000.
Jane originated as the Abortion Counseling Service, a counseling and referral group that arranged discreet abortions. The organization eventually took full control of the process by hiring its own in-house doctor. After discovering that this person had falsely claimed to be a certified physician, the members decided to learn and perform the procedures themselves. The abortions that members performed—during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy—resulted in a favourable safety record, comparable to that of medical professionals of the day in California and New York (states where abortions were then legal). The collective disbanded upon the national legalization of abortion in 1973.
