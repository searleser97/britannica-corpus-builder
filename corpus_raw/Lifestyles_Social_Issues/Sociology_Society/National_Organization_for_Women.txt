National Organization for Women (NOW),  American activist organization (founded 1966) that promotes equal rights for women. It is the largest feminist group in the United States, with some 500,000 members in the early 21st century.
The National Organization for Women was established by a small group of feminists who were dedicated to actively challenging sex discrimination in all areas of American society. Betty Friedan, one of its founders, served as NOW’s first president. The organization is composed of both men and women, and it has a presence in all 50 states. Headquarters are in Washington, D.C.
Among the issues that NOW addresses by means of lobbying, demonstrations, and litigation are child care, pregnancy leave, abortion rights, and pension rights. Its initial major concern was passage of a national Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution. Although the amendment failed to gain ratification in 1982, the organization has continued to advocate for it. NOW also campaigns for such issues as passage of state equal rights amendments and comparable-worth legislation (equal pay for work of comparable value) and has met with arguably greater success on the state level. Although focusing on women’s issues, the organization seeks to end all discrimination, and it notably supports the rights of the LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer) community. While nonpartisan, NOW created (1977) a political action committee that supports politicians who share the organization’s goals.
