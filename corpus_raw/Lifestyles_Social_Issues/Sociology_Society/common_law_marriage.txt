Common-law marriage,   marriage undertaken without either a civil or religious ceremony. In a common-law marriage, the parties simply agree to consider themselves married. The common-law marriage is a rarity today, mainly because of the legal problems of property and inheritance that attend it in complex urban societies.
Common-law marriages were valid in England until Lord Hardwicke’s Act of 1753. The act did not apply to Scotland, however, and for many years thereafter couples went north across the border to thwart the ban. On the European continent, common-law marriages were frequent in the Middle Ages, but their legality was abolished in the Roman Catholic countries by the Council of Trent (1545–63), which required that marriages be celebrated in the presence of a priest and two witnesses.
British colonial rule in Africa did much to eradicate the equivalent of common-law marriages there, but the independence of African nations has led to a reemergence of what is called customary marriage, although certain formal requirements remain, such as registration.
In the United States by the second half of the 20th century, common-law marriages were valid in about one-third of the states, absolutely or conditionally (if entered into before a certain statute-defined date).
Where common-law marriage was recognized, the only requirement was mutual agreement to undertake matrimonial relations. Such marriages, however, were subject otherwise to the same strictures on age and sanguinity as formal marriages. A formal marriage that had been defectively solemnized (e.g., because of an error on the marriage license) was often declared valid as a common-law marriage.
