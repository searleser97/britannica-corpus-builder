Undenominational Fellowship of Christian Churches and Churches of Christ, also called Independent Christian Churches,  autonomous Protestant churches in the United States that were formerly associated primarily with the Disciples of Christ. These churches refused to become part of the restructured Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) in 1968 because they feared that the development of denominational institutions in the reorganized church would infringe on the freedom of the local congregation. From 1967 to 1969 the number of congregations listed in the Yearbook of Christian Churches (Disciples of Christ) dropped from 8,046 to 5,278.
The Independent Christian Churches do not identify with the Churches of Christ, however, because the independents accept the use of musical instruments in church services, which the Churches of Christ reject. In general, the independents are more conservative theologically than the members of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). They have no denominational structure or national organization.
