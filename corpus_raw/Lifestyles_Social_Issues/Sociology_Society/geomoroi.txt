Geōmoroi, also called agroikoi, or Geōrgoi,  class of citizens in ancient Greek society. In 7th-century-bc Attic society, geōmoroi were freemen, generally peasant farm holders, lower on the social and political scale than the eupatridae, the aristocracy, but above the dēmiourgoi, the artisans. The geōmoroi were ineligible for any major political or religious post but had the right to attend sessions of the Assembly. In 580 bc, three geōmoroi shared the archonship (magistracy) with five eupatridae and two dēmiourgoi.
In Syracuse and in Samos, where society was divided into only two classes, the geōmoroi were the oligarchs, contrasted with the dēmos, the common people.
