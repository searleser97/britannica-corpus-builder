Elizabeth Leslie Rous Comstock, née Elizabeth Leslie Rous,  (born October 30, 1815, Maidenhead, Berkshire, England—died August 3, 1891, Union Springs, New York, U.S.),  Anglo-American Quaker minister and social reformer, an articulate abolitionist and an influential worker for social welfare who helped adjust the perspective of the Society of Friends to the changes wrought by the urban-industrial age.
Elizabeth Rous was educated in Quaker schools in Islington and Croydon and subsequently taught in the Quaker schools in Croydon and Ackworth. In 1848 she married Leslie Wright, who died three years later. She kept a shop in Bakewell, Derbyshire, until 1854, when she immigrated to Canada and settled in Belleville, Ontario. There she again kept a shop and, inspired by the work of the English Quaker reformer Elizabeth Fry, gradually took on the role of Quaker minister.
In 1858 Rous married John T. Comstock of Rollin, Michigan, where she went to live. Her public ministry quickly came to include abolitionism and work on the Underground Railroad, on which Rollin was a highly active station. Elizabeth Comstock’s services as a public speaker were much in demand, not only among Quaker assemblies but also among reform groups.
During the American Civil War, Comstock traveled widely, ministering to those in hospitals and prison camps and to refugee slaves. Her interest in the plight of the freedmen continued unabated after the war, and she wrote and spoke frequently in their behalf. Prison reform, temperance, peace, women’s rights, and home-mission welfare work also engaged her attention, and, by her emphasis on the last, an early form of social agency work adapted to the rapidly growing cities, she was of considerable influence in reshaping the Quaker social outlook and work to the new realities of an urban-industrial age. In 1885, following her husband’s death, she settled in Union Springs, New York.
