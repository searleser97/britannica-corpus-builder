Servants of India Society,  society founded by Gopal Krishna Gokhale in 1905 to unite and train Indians of different ethnicities and religions in welfare work. It was the first secular organization in that country to devote itself to the underprivileged, rural and tribal people, emergency relief work, the increase of literacy, and other social causes.
Members go through a five-year training period and agree to serve on extremely modest salaries. In 1915 Gokhale was succeeded as president by Srinivasa Sastri (1869â€“1946). The organization has its headquarters in Pune (Poona) and branches in Chennai (Madras), Mumbai (Bombay), Allahabad, Nagpur, and other locales. Though the number of members has dwindled over time, the society has been influential in its demonstration of the ideals of social service.
