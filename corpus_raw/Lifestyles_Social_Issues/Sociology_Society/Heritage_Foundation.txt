Heritage Foundation,  U.S. conservative public policy research organization, or think tank, based in Washington, D.C. Its mission is “to formulate and promote conservative public policies based on the principles of free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional American values, and a strong national defense.” Founded in 1973 by two Congressional aides, Edwin Feulner and Paul Weyrich, it provides research on pending political issues to Congress, policymakers, news media, and academic communities. The foundation flourished during the presidency of Ronald Reagan (1981–89), who used its handbook Mandate for Leadership: Principles to Limit Government, Expand Freedom, and Strengthen America to provide guidance for his administration.
