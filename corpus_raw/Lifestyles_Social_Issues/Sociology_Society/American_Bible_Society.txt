American Bible Society (ABS),  international agency under lay control, formed in New York in 1816 as a union of 28 local Bible societies “to encourage the wider circulation of the Holy Scriptures throughout the world, without note or comment, through translation, publication, distribution, and stimulation of use.” Early in its history it set as its goal the placing of a Bible in every home, including those on the frontier. The ABS is supported by more than 80 Protestant denominations. In 1946 the ABS helped to form the United Bible Societies, which has offices and affiliates in more than 140 countries.
