Society for the Propagation of the Faith,  organ of the papacy for the collection and distribution of money to support Roman Catholic missions throughout the world. The society was organized in Lyon, Fr., on May 3, 1822, at a meeting of laymen called to raise money for the missions in Louisiana, U.S. This group joined with and adopted the fund-raising methods of Pauline Jaricot, who had been collecting for missions since 1818 and who was later designated by Pope Leo XIII as the official founder of the society. In 1922 the headquarters of the society was moved from France, where it had been under the control of a French council of laymen, to Rome, where Pope Pius XI reorganized it and made it the chief fund-raising and distribution agency for all Roman Catholic missions.
