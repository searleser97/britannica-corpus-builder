William Richard Morris, Viscount Nuffield,  (born Oct. 10, 1877, Worcestershire, Eng.—died  Aug. 22, 1963, near Huntercombe, Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire), British industrialist and philanthropist whose automobile manufacturing firm introduced the Morris cars.
The son of a farm labourer, Morris was obliged by his father’s illness to abandon plans to study medicine and go to work at age 15. Behind his home he set up a bicycle repair shop, built bicycles to order, and raced them with success. Later he sold and maintained motorcycles, an interest he easily extended to automobiles. In 1903 he took in a partner, but their garage went bankrupt. In 1904, with only his tools left and a £50 debt, he started again. He set up works in Cowley, and the first Morris-Oxford, an 8.9-horsepower two-seater, appeared in 1913. The sales of this machine having made him prosperous, he soon brought out the equally famous Morris-Cowley (11.9 horsepower), after he had visited the United States with a designer and had contracted to buy an engine to fit his English chassis.
By producing small, reliable cars at the low prices made possible by mass production, Morris revolutionized the automobile industry in England much as Henry Ford had done in the United States. Morris Motors Ltd., founded in 1919, survived the difficulties of 1920–21 by slashing prices. From then on, the business expanded, and in 1923 the Morris Garages built the first MG. In the same year, Morris founded Morris Commercial Cars Ltd., and in 1927 he acquired Wolseley Motors Ltd. Morris Motors Ltd. was reorganized in 1935–36 to include these three companies and also Riley (Coventry) Ltd. in 1938. After a merger with the Austin Motor Company in 1952, the resulting firm, the British Motor Corporation, became the third largest automobile company in the world.
Morris, who was made a baronet in 1929 and a baron in 1934, was created Viscount Nuffield in 1938. (His marriage was childless, and the peerage became extinct upon his death.) His philanthropic activities began in the early 1930s, beneficiaries including the Nuffield Institute for Medical Research, the University of Oxford; the Nuffield Trust; Nuffield College, Oxford; and the Nuffield Foundation.
