Henry Mayhew,  (born 1812, London, England—died July 25, 1887, London), English journalist and sociologist, a founder of the magazine Punch (1841), who was a vivid and voluminous writer best known for London Labour and the London Poor, 4 vol. (1851–62). His evocation of the sights and sounds of London in this work influenced Charles Dickens and other writers.
Mayhew, the son of a solicitor, ran away to sea at age 12 and made a voyage to India. Upon his return he studied law with his father but soon turned to journalism. He helped to found the periodicals Figaro in London (1831) and The Thief (1832) before organizing the highly successful Punch, of which he was coeditor (with Mark Lemon) for two years. He also wrote plays, farces, fairy tales, and novels, some in collaboration with his brother Augustus Septimus Mayhew (1826–75). Short of money in his later years, he produced much hackwork and died in obscurity.
Mayhew had a genius for lively and sensitive reportage of people, including social outcasts and nomads, and of contrasting ways of life; and he was able to combine his observation with penetrating economic and social analysis, some of it with a Marxist flavour. London Labour and the London Poor was based on letters he wrote to the London Morning Chronicle in 1849–50, at the end of a stormy decade in British social history. Responding to the newspaper’s desire for “trustworthy information” on the great social problems of the day, Mayhew prepared three volumes that were published in 1851; the fourth volume, The Criminal Prisons of London, was written in collaboration with John Binny and did not appear until 1862. A revised complete edition was published in 1864.
