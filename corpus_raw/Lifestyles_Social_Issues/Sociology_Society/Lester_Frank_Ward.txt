Lester Frank Ward,  (born June 18, 1841, Joliet, Illinois, U.S.—died  April 18, 1913, Washington, D.C.), American sociologist who was instrumental in establishing sociology as an academic discipline in the United States. An optimist who believed that the social sciences had already given mankind the information basic to happiness, Ward advocated a planned, or “telic,” society (“sociocracy”) in which nationally organized education would be the dynamic factor. In his system social scientists, assembled into a legislative advisory academy in Washington, D.C., would occupy much the same role as did the sociologist-priests in the utopian plan of French sociologist Auguste Comte.
After fighting for the Union in the American Civil War, Ward obtained degrees in botany and law. For most of his life he worked for the federal government, mainly in the fields of geology, paleontology, botany, and paleobotany; he made some significant contributions to botanical theory. By 1876 Ward had shifted the focus of the work, which was begun in 1869, to sociology, and in 1906, when he was 65 years old, he was appointed professor of sociology at Brown University.
Ward followed Comte in conceiving of sociology as the fundamental social science, the primary responsibility of which is to teach methods of improving society. Ward’s emphasis on social function and planning, rather than social structure, had considerable effect on Thorstein Veblen and the institutional economists.
The original subject of Ward’s most important book, Dynamic Sociology, 2 vol. (1883), was education. Among his other writings are Pure Sociology (1903), A Textbook of Sociology (1905; with James Quayle Dealey), and Applied Sociology (1906), which concerns his ideas of “social telesis,” sociocracy, and social planning.
