Antoine Frédéric Ozanam,  (born April 23, 1813, Milan, Kingdom of Italy—died September 8, 1853, Marseille, France; beatified August 22, 1997), French historian, lawyer, and scholar who founded the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.
While a student in Lyon, he underwent a “crisis of doubt” but emerged with a deep-rooted belief in both Roman Catholicism and the religious necessity for charity. In Paris, where he went to study law, Ozanam met the leaders of the French Roman Catholic revival.
In 1833 he and fellow students at the Sorbonne organized a Conference of Charity to help the poor. Two years later, the group adopted the formal title and rules of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, now highly regarded for its charitable acts. Before Ozanam’s death the society numbered about 2,000 centres in 29 countries.
Ozanam was also known for his brilliant papers on law, literature, history, and social doctrine. Among his principal writings are Dante et la philosophie catholique au XIIIe siècle (1845; “Dante and Catholic Philosophy in the 13th Century”); Les Poètes franciscains en Italie au XIIIe siècle (1852; “Franciscan Poets in Italy in the 13th Century”), an edition of early Franciscan poetry; and La Civilisation chrétienne chez les Francs (1849; “Christian Civilization Among the Franks”).
Ozanam was notable for his insistence that charity be extended to non-Catholics and to other countries, at the time an unusual belief. He encouraged Roman Catholics to play a part in the evolution of the democratic state, and he remained a clear-sighted theorist of social reform while opposing both the abuses of laissez-faire economic liberalism and any recourse to socialism. His exposition of Roman Catholic social doctrine in his lectures while teaching commercial law at Lyon foreshadowed in their authoritative orthodoxy Pope Leo XIII’s encyclical Rerum novarum of 1891. Ozanam was beatified by Pope John Paul II in 1997.
