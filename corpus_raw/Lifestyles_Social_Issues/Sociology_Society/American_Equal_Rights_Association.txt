American Equal Rights Association (AERA),  organization that, from 1866 to 1869, worked to “secure Equal Rights to all American citizens, especially the right of suffrage, irrespective of race, color, or sex.”
Founded on May 10, 1866, during the Eleventh National Woman’s Rights Convention, the AERA met its first test in 1867. In that year Kansas, a Republican state, voted down two separate referenda granting suffrage to blacks and women, respectively. During the Kansas campaign, organization founders Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony had accepted the help of a known racist, alienating abolitionist members as well as AERA president Lucretia Mott.
Angry with the wording and passage of the Fifteenth Amendment in 1870 because it ignored women’s rights in favour of blacks’, Stanton and Anthony urged the AERA to support a 16th amendment giving women the vote. More cautious leaders refused, and Stanton and Anthony left the AERA in May 1869 to form the exclusively female National Woman Suffrage Association. Unable to reconcile with the radical feminists, Lucy Stone, Julia Ward Howe, and other conservative feminists formed the American Woman Suffrage Association from the ashes of the AERA in November 1869. In 1890 the groups merged as the National American Woman Suffrage Association.
