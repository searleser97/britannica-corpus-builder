Blood brotherhood,  one of several kinds of alliances or ties that bind persons together in a fashion analogous to, but distinct from, kinship ties. Other forms of fictive kinship include adoption and godparenthood.
Blood brotherhood derives its name from the ritual commingling of the blood of the participants. The nature of the alliance thus formed typically enjoins the members to mutual support, loyalty, or affection. When practiced between groups, blood brotherhood most frequently serves to bind together potentially hostile sets of individuals, to form an alliance in war, or to conclude a peace. References to blood brotherhood occur in the works of many classical writers, beginning with Herodotus (5th century bc). Other accounts of blood brotherhood occur in myths and sagas from central Europe, Scandinavia, and Asia. The custom has also been documented in Africa and, rarely, among North American Indians.
