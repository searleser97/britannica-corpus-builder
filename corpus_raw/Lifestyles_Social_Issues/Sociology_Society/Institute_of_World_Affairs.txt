Institute of World Affairs (IWA),  formerly Students’ International Union,  nongovernmental organization (NGO) that develops educational and training programs in conflict analysis, conflict management, and postconflict peace building. It is headquartered in Vienna, Va.
The IWA was founded in 1924 in Geneva by a group of English and American students who wanted to contribute to global peace. This initial group was the nucleus of the Students’ International Union (SIU), which was conceived as a global student organization. In 1941, after the outbreak of World War II, the SIU relocated to the United States. It changed its name to the IWA at about this time. The IWA sponsored summer seminars with speakers drawn from government, the military, and academia. In the 1990s the organization began to develop programs and seminars for a wider audience, including diplomats, business leaders, journalists, younger students, and senior citizens.
The group’s advisory committee and senior associates have included well-known figures such as television journalist Tom Brokaw and former secretary of state Henry Kissinger, as well as regional experts. It also partners with NGOs throughout East Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America to gain grassroots expertise. The IWA is funded through grants, contracts, and private contributions.
