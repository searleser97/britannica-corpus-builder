Yukaghir language,   language spoken by not more than a few hundred persons in the Kolyma River region of Sakha (Yakutiya) republic of Russia. Yukaghir was traditionally grouped in the catchall category of Paleo-Siberian languages with a number of languages that are not genetically related or structurally similar. More recently, however, Yukaghir has been considered a distant relative of the Uralic language family. Yukaghir and two extinct languages or dialects, Omok and Chuvan (or Chuvantsy), constitute the Yukaghir language group or family.
