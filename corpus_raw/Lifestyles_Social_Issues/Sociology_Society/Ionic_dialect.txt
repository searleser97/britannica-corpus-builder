Ionic dialect,  any of several Ancient Greek dialects spoken in Euboea, in the Northern Cyclades, and from approximately 1000 bc in Asiatic Ionia, where Ionian colonists from Athens founded their cities. Attic and Ionic dialects together form a dialect group.
The artificial dialect of the Homeric epics is Asiatic Ionic, Homerâ€™s maternal language, though it is interspersed with many Aeolic and some Mycenaean elements as a result of a long pre-Homeric epic tradition. This Epic-Ionic was used in all later hexametric and elegiac poetry, not only by Ionians but also by foreigners such as the Boeotian Hesiod. Standard Eastern Ionic is found in the iambic poetry of Archilochus, Semonides of Amorgos, and Hipponax of Ephesus. The oldest Greek prose, that of Heracleitus, Hecataeus, Herodotus, Democritus, and Hippocrates, was also written in the Ionic dialect, but by the end of the 5th century bc, it had been supplanted by Attic.
