Ge languages,   a group of about 10 South American Indian languages that extend through inland eastern Brazil as far as the Uruguayan border. Most linguists classify the Ge languages with a number of smaller groups (most of which were located closer to the Atlantic coast and are now extinct) in a Macro-Ge grouping.
