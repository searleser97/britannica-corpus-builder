National Council of Hispanic Women (NCHW),  organization of both individuals and organizations, such as universities and corporations, founded in 1985 with the mission of empowering Hispanic women and giving them a greater role in American society. The main goal of the organization is to have a more direct representation for its members in policy making by establishing Hispanic women in positions of leadership in business and government. 
In addition to assisting Hispanic women in obtaining such leadership roles, NCHW works to ameliorate the general economic and social opportunities for Hispanics; members of the organization represent Hispanic interests at national conferences and in public policy debates. NCHW is also concerned with incorporating the Hispanic community into mainstream American society. The organization holds an annual conference and publishes a quarterly newsletter to keep its members informed about public policy issues affecting the Hispanic community.
