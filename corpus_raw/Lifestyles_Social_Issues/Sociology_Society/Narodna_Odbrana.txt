Narodna Odbrana, (Serbo-Croatian: “National Defense”)  Serbian nationalist organization, founded in 1908, that gathered recruits from Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia, and Croatia and tried to foment an anti-Habsburg revolution in Bosnia. Although it officially transformed itself into a cultural society in 1909, it continued its clandestine operations and was mistakenly blamed by Austrian authorities for the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand (1914).
