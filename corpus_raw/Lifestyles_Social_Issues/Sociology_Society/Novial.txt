Novial,   artificial language constructed in 1928 by the Danish philologist Otto Jespersen, intended for use as an international auxiliary language, but little used today. Its grammar is similar in type to that of Esperanto or Ido. Novial has one definite article, no gender for nouns except those denoting persons, noun plurals in -s, forms for a possessive (genitive) and an objective (accusative) case (although these need not be used), adjectives with uninflected form, and verbs that are not inflected for person or number. The chief difference between Novial and Esperanto or Ido is the former’s much larger use of Germanic word roots and grammatical structures (such as auxiliary verbs sal “shall, will,” vud “would,” ha, had “have, had,” and tu “to” to mark the infinitive of the verb: tu perda “to lose”).
