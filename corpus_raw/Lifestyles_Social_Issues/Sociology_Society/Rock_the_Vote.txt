Rock the Vote,  nonprofit political advocacy organization dedicated to increasing youth voter turnout in the United States. Rock the Vote conducts voter registration drives, sponsors voter education events, and runs ads encouraging young people to vote. Rock the Vote events and ads usually prominently feature celebrities from Hollywood and the music industry. The group describes itself as nonpartisan.
Rock the Vote was established in Los Angeles in 1990 by Jeff Ayeroff, the co-chief of Virgin Records, to combat what he and other music executives saw as threats to artistic freedom; these included efforts to enact legislation mandating warning labels for records with explicit lyrics and attempts to prosecute sellers of explicit records on obscenity charges. Funded by record companies and performers, the groupâ€™s first ad campaign featured celebrities denouncing censorship.
In the run-up to the 1992 U.S. presidential election, the group expanded its efforts beyond music issues, focusing on increasing voter turnout rates among young people, which were typically lower than rates for the general population. In addition to holding voter registration drives at concerts and on college campuses, Rock the Vote partnered with television networks such as MTV to broadcast public service announcements encouraging young people to vote, and youth participation did indeed increase in 1992. Rock the Vote staged similar initiatives in subsequent presidential elections, registering voters and organizing candidate forums. The group also lobbied for legislation allowing voter registration to be carried out online and over the telephone.
