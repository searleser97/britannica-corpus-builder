National Association of Congregational Christian Churches,   association of churches organized in Detroit, Mich., in 1955 by ministers and laymen of Congregational Christian Churches who did not wish to take part in the merger of the Congregational Christian Churches and the Evangelical and Reformed Church that formed the United Church of Christ. The National Association wished to continue the independent tradition of congregationalism. Churches or associations of churches that have joined the National Association preserve their autonomy and are not required to accept any creed or program.
The National Association meets annually. Between annual meetings an executive committee carries on the work of the body. Several commissions oversee such divisions as Christian education, the ministry, and publications. Missionary work is carried out both in the United States and in other parts of the world. Headquarters of the National Association are in Milwaukee, Wis.
