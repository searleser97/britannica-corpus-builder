Hattian language, also called Hattic or Khattic or Khattish,  non-Indo-European language of ancient Anatolia. The Hattian language appears as hattili ‘in Hattian’ in Hittite cuneiform texts. Called Proto-Hittite by some, Hattian was the language of the linguistic substratum inside the Halys River (now called the Kızıl River) bend and in more-northerly regions. It is impossible to ascertain the length of time that the Hattians had been present in Anatolia before the Indo-Europeans entered the country, but it seems certain that by the beginning of the Hittite New Empire (c. 1400–c. 1190 bce), Hattian was a dead language.
The Indo-European newcomers of Hittite stock took the same name as their predecessors. All the Hattian material preserved by Hittite scribes concerns the religious sphere of life; the texts include rituals (such as those connected with the erection of a new building), incantations, antiphons, litanies, and myths. Among the Hattian interpolations in Hittite texts, there are some to which a Hittite translation has been added. A striking feature of the grammar of Hattian is its agglutination; it has both prefixes and suffixes. There are no formal marks to distinguish nouns from verbs.
Hattian studies began in 1922 with the work of Assyriologist Emil Forrer. In 1935 Hans G. Güterbock, a pioneering Hittitologist, published a large group of texts containing Hattian material, including many of the Hattian texts stemming from excavations led by archaeologists Hugo Winckler and Theodore Makridi at the ancient Hittite city of Hattusa (near modern Boğazkale, formerly Boğazköy, Tur.).
