Francesco De Sanctis,  (born March 28, 1817, Morra Irpina, Kingdom of Naples [now in Italy]—died  Dec. 29, 1883, Naples, Italy), Italian literary critic whose work contributed significantly to the understanding of Italian literature and civilization.
De Sanctis, a liberal patriot, took part in the Neapolitan revolution of 1848 and for some years was a prisoner of the Bourbons. He then lived in exile in Turin (then in the Kingdom of Sardinia) and Zürich, Switz., where he became known as a teacher and lecturer. He returned to Italy in 1860 and began working on educational reform, serving as minister of education in 1861–62, 1878, and 1879–80. In 1871–77 he was professor of comparative literature at the University of Naples.
A scholar of literature and history, De Sanctis brought to his criticism a knowledge of philosophy, particularly Hegelian aesthetics. His essays on the Italian poets (Saggi critici, 1866; Nuovi saggi critici, 1873) relate these poets to the society of their times. His masterpiece, Storia della letteratura italiana (1870–71; History of Italian Literature), is an illuminating account not only of Italian literature but of the development of Italian society from the 13th to the 19th century.
