William Legge, 2nd earl of Dartmouth,  (born June 20, 1731—died  July 15, 1801, Blackheath, Kent, England), British statesman who played a significant role in the events leading to the American Revolution.
Legge was educated at Westminster School and Trinity College, Oxford. In 1750 he succeeded his grandfather as earl of Dartmouth and later entered on a political career, taking his seat in the House of Lords in May 1754. In the marquess of Rockingham’s first administration, Dartmouth was appointed president of the Board of Trade and a member of the Privy Council (July 1765). During his tenure (1765–66) he opposed the Stamp Act and worked for the act’s repeal.
In 1772 Dartmouth became secretary of state for the colonies in the ministry of his stepbrother, Lord North. Faced with mounting hostility in the British North American colonies, he adopted a policy of conciliation to allow tensions to abate. When this policy was rendered ineffective by the Boston Tea Party, Dartmouth sought to reimpose strict British control over the colonies. The Intolerable Acts, which he supported, only exacerbated tensions, as did the Quebec Act (1774), which he defended from attempts at repeal. He rejected further proposals for conciliation with the colonies and in 1776 called for the use of overwhelming force to suppress the growing rebellion. Unwilling, however, to direct a war against the colonists, he resigned his offices in November 1775 but remained in the cabinet as Lord Privy Seal until 1782 in order to support Lord North.
Dartmouth, a devout evangelical Anglican, befriended the Methodist John Wesley and the Quaker John Fothergill. He supported the work of Eleazar Wheelock, a Congregationalist minister, in establishing a school for the education of Native Americans. This school developed into Dartmouth College of Hanover, New Hampshire, which was named in Dartmouth’s honour.
