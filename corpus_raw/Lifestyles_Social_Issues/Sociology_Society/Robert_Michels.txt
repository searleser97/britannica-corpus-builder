Robert Michels,  (born Jan. 9, 1876, Cologne—died  May 3, 1936, Rome), German-born Italian political sociologist and economist, noted for his formulation of the “iron law of oligarchy,” which states that political parties and other membership organizations inevitably tend toward oligarchy, authoritarianism, and bureaucracy.
Born into a wealthy German bourgeois family, Michels became a socialist and spent most of his life teaching in Italy; he held academic positions at the universities of Turin, Basel, and Perugia. In his major work, Zur Soziologie des Parteiwesens in der modernen Demokratie (1911; Political Parties: A Sociological Study of the Oligarchical Tendencies of Modern Democracy), he set forth his ideas on the inevitable development of oligarchies, even in organizations committed to democratic ideals, because of such organizational needs as rapid decisionmaking and full-time activity. In his later writings Michels came to view this elitist rule as not only inevitable but also desirable, and he did not oppose the rise of Fascism in Italy. His Corso di sociologia politica and other writings were translated into English as First Lectures in Political Sociology (1949).
