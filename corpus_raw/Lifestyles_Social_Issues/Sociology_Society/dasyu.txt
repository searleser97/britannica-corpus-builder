Dasyu, Sanskrit dāsa (“servant”),  an aboriginal people in India who were encountered by the Indo-European-speaking peoples who entered northern India about 1500 bce. They were described by the Indo-Europeans as a dark-skinned, harsh-spoken people who worshipped the phallus. Some Western scholars who view the lingam (a Hindu votary object) as a phallic symbol have conjectured that it originated with the dasyu; others hold that this description of the dasyu may have referred to their sexual practices. The dasyu lived in fortified places from which they sent out armies. They may have been among the  Shudras, or labourers, who served the three higher classes— Brahman (priests), Kshatriya (warriors), and Vaishya (merchants)—from whose ritual communion they were excluded.
