Daniel Bell,  (born May 10, 1919, New York, New York, U.S.—died January 25, 2011, Cambridge, Massachusetts), American sociologist and journalist who used sociological theory to reconcile what he believed were the inherent contradictions of capitalist societies.
Bell was educated at City College of New York, where he received a B.S. (1939), and was employed as a journalist for more than 20 years. As managing editor of The New Leader (1941–44) and labour editor for Fortune (1948–58), he wrote voluminously on various social subjects. After serving in Paris (1956–57) as director of the seminar program of the Congress for Cultural Freedom, he received a doctorate at Columbia University (1960), where he was appointed professor of sociology (1959–69). In 1969 Bell became a professor of sociology at Harvard University, where he remained until 1990.
Bell’s extensive output has reflected his concern with political and economic institutions and the ways in which they shape the individual. Among his books are Marxian Socialism in the United States (1952; reprinted 1967), The End of Ideology: On the Exhaustion of Political Ideas in the 1950s (1960), The Radical Right (1963), and The Reforming of General Education (1966). The Coming of Post-Industrial Society (1973) and The Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism (1976) attempt to define the relationship between science, technology, and capitalism. His views of nonconformism in contemporary society are expressed in The Winding Passage (1980). His work has stimulated controversy over the ideological biases among leading scholars in the discipline of sociology.
Bell received numerous awards for his work, including the American Sociological Association (ASA) Lifetime Achievement Award (1992), the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (AAAS) Talcott Parsons Prize for the Social Sciences (1993), and the French government’s Alexis de Tocqueville Prize (1995).
