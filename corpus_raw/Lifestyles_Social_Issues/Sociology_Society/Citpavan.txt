Citpāvan, also called Konkanasth,  caste of Brahmans in Konkan (the area of Goa) and Mahārāshtra state in western India. They rose to considerable eminence in Mahārāshtra as administrators during the rule of the peshwas of Poona (1713–1818), who belonged to that caste. The predominance among them of fair complexions and light-coloured eyes has given rise to the speculation that they are descended from shipwrecked European sailors. While many Citpāvan Brahmans continue the administrative tradition, others are active in the professions and in scholarship.
