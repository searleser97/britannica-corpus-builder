Honorific,  a grammatical form used in speaking to a social superior. In English it has largely disappeared, retained only in the use of the third person when speaking to someone clearly superior in rank (“Does your highness wish it?”). In other Indo-European languages it has a vestigial form in the degree of formality attached to the use of second-person pronouns: e.g., in German Sie (“you”) rather than the familiar du (“you,” or “thou”).
Japanese, Korean, and Javanese have extensive honorific systems, influencing vocabulary, verb conjugation, and the inflection of nouns. Nothing can be expressed in Japanese without at the same time expressing a level of politeness related to the speakers’ sexes, ages, relative status, and degree of intimacy. In Japanese the deferential prefix o- can be attached to the addressee’s name or to an object being discussed. The frequent use of o- shows refinement. Japanese has 10 words for “I” (differentiated by sex, formality, social status, and so on) and even an honorific, kun, to be used among boys.
As contemporary societies become more egalitarian, some honorific systems show signs of eroding.
