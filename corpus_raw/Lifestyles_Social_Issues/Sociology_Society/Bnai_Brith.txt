B’nai B’rith,   (Hebrew: “Sons of the Covenant”), oldest and largest Jewish service organization in the world, with men’s lodges, women’s chapters, and youth chapters in countries all over the world. 
B’nai B’rith, founded in New York City in 1843, defends human rights, promotes intercultural relations, provides for the religious and cultural needs of Jewish college students (especially through the Hillel Foundation), sponsors Jewish education among adults and youth groups, supports hospitals and philanthropic institutions, provides vocational guidance, sponsors welfare projects in Israel, assists victims of natural disasters, and carries on a broad program of community service and welfare. It confers with government leaders on such issues as civil rights, immigration, abuses of freedom by totalitarian states, the position of Israel, and problems affecting Jews throughout the world. In 1913 it established the Anti-Defamation League. B’nai B’rith is represented at the United Nations through its membership in the Coordinating Board of Jewish Organizations.
The order is headed by a president elected at triennial meetings of the supreme lodge (made up of representatives of district grand lodges), a board of governors, and an administrative committee.
In 1990 B’nai B’rith International voted to admit women as full members; a self-governing, affiliated organization—B’nai B’rith Women—desiring to remain concerned with women’s issues continued its independent status.
