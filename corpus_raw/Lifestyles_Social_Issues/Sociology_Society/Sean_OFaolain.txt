Sean O’Faolain, original name John Francis Whelan,  (born February 22, 1900, Cork, County Cork, Ireland—died April 20, 1991, Dublin), Irish writer best known for his short stories about Ireland’s lower and middle classes. He often examined the decline of the nationalist struggle or the failings of Irish Roman Catholicism. His work reflects the reawakening of interest in Irish culture stimulated by the Irish literary renaissance of the early 20th century.
Disturbed by the brutality of the British repression of the Easter Rising of 1916, O’Faolain changed his name, studied Gaelic, and became involved in anti-British activities during the Irish insurrection (1918–21). He received M.A. degrees from the National University of Ireland in Dublin and Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and was a Commonwealth fellow from 1926 to 1928 and a Harvard fellow from 1928 to 1929.
From 1926 to 1933 O’Faolain taught Gaelic, Anglo-Irish literature, and English in universities and high schools in Great Britain and the United States. Returning to Ireland, he taught briefly until the success of Midsummer Night Madness and Other Stories (1932), his first collection of stories, and A Nest of Simple Folk (1933), a novel set in the period between the Easter Rising (1916) and the establishment of the Irish Free State (1921), allowed him to write full-time. O’Faolain produced only four novels, including Bird Alone (1936) and Come Back to Erin (1940), each portraying a central character who attempts to rebel against and rise above the lower-middle class. He later wrote short stories, essays, biography, and travel works that gave unflattering yet sympathetic and realistic portraits of modern Irish life. His criticisms of church-inspired censorship, the narrowness of the Irish clergy, and restrictive family traditions aroused considerable discussion. His well-known works include King of the Beggars: A Life of Daniel O’Connell (1938) and Vive moi! (1964), his autobiography. Historical views of the Irish people are contained in The Irish, a Character Study (1949; rev. ed. 1969) and An Irish Journey (1940). Selected Stories was published in 1978 and the novel And Again? in 1979. The Collected Stories of Sean O’Faolain I appeared in 1980.
O’Faolain served as director of the Arts Council of Ireland from 1957 to 1959. From 1940 to 1946 he was editor in Dublin of the Irish literary periodical The Bell, which was the major literary forum in Ireland in the mid-20th century; it was outspoken in its attacks on censorship and conservative aspects of Irish nationalism and Catholicism.
