Samuel A. Barnett, in full Samuel Augustus Barnett,  (born February 8, 1844, Bristol, Gloucestershire, England—died June 17, 1913, London), Anglican priest and social reformer who founded building programs and cultural centres (notably Toynbee Hall, 1884, which Barnett served as its first warden) in London’s impoverished East End. In his teaching and writings he advanced a doctrine of Christian socialism. Barnett House, Oxford, a centre for the study of social sciences, was founded in his memory. Among his works is Practicable Socialism (1888), written with the aid of his wife, Henrietta Octavia Rowland, who was also active in Barnett’s social reform efforts.
