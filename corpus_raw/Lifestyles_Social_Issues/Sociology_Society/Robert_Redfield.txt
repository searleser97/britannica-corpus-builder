Robert Redfield,  (born Dec. 4, 1897, Chicago—died  Oct. 16, 1958, Chicago), U.S. cultural anthropologist who was the pioneer and, for a number of years, the principal ethnologist to focus on those processes of cultural and social change characterizing the relationship between folk and urban societies.
A visit to Mexico in 1923 drew Redfield from law to the study of anthropology, and in 1926 he returned to Mexico for fieldwork. He joined the faculty of the University of Chicago in 1927, receiving his Ph.D. in 1928. Results of his field endeavours appeared in Tepoztlán, a Mexican Village (1930), which gained prompt recognition as an innovative work. In 1930 he became a research associate of the Carnegie Institution, Washington, D.C., for which he conducted field study over the next 16 years in the Yucatán and Guatemala. In 1934 he was appointed professor of anthropology and dean of social sciences at Chicago. With Alfonso Villa Rojas, who became one of Mexico’s foremost anthropologists, he wrote Chan Kom: A Maya Village (1934), which contained observations of contemporary Maya culture and considered a new question for anthropology in the 1930s, acculturation. A comparison of a tribal community, a peasant village, a provincial town, and Mérida, the Yucatán capital, formed the basis of The Folk Culture of the Yucatán (1941). This work elaborated a hypothetical continuum indicating how the growth of a small, isolated community into a large, heterogeneous society involves progressive degrees of social change and cultural disorganization. Returning to Chan Kom in 1948, he observed changes that had taken place since his earlier work there and wrote A Village That Chose Progress (1950).
Redfield’s later study of the civilizations of China and India, which he visited, suggested his concept of civilizations as cultural systems of interdependent, coexisting “great” and “little” traditions. He dealt with these concepts in The Little Community (1955) and Peasant Society and Culture (1956). Associated with the University of Chicago until his death, in his later years he launched an interdisciplinary comparative study of civilizations. His wife, Margaret Park Redfield, survived him and edited his Papers, 2 vol. (1962–63).
