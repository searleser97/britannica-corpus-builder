Banneret,   a European medieval knight privileged to display in the field a square banner (as distinct from the tapering pennon of a simple knight). The term was used in countries of French and English speech from the 13th to the 16th century. In 13th-century England any commander of a troop of 10 or more lances who was not a count or an earl was usually a banneret. Later, in both England and France, the style became a title of honour, conferred for distinguished military service. There is no connection between the style of banneret and the baronetage (hereditary dignity) established in England by King James I in 1611.
