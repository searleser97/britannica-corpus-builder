Indian Association,  nationalist political group in India that favoured local self-government and served as a preparatory agent for the more truly national Indian National Congress. The association was founded in Bengal in 1876 by Surendranath Banerjea and Ananda Mohan Bose; it soon displaced the Indian League, which had been founded the year before, and rivaled the long-standing British Indian Association, which it regarded as a reactionary body of landlords and industrialists. The association was supported mainly by younger professional men among the Bengali intelligentsia. It spread beyond Bengal to other parts of India but remained Bengali in character, using expatriate Bengali communities as centres for its provincial branches.
The association found an issue in opposing the lowering of the age limit for civil service examinations (1877), which was disadvantageous to Indian candidates; and in 1878 it objected to the Vernacular Press Act, which stifled the Indian press. It advocated local self-government and tenant rights, and, when the Bengal Tenancy Act was finally passed in 1885, it demanded representative government. After the Indian National Congress was founded in 1885, the association gradually lost ground; it was not heard of after 1888.
