White Father, member of Society of Missionaries of Africa (M.Afr.),  a Roman Catholic international missionary society of priests and brothers whose sole field of activity is Africa. It was founded in North Africa in 1868 by the archbishop of Algiers, Charles-Martial-Allemand Lavigerie. The societyâ€™s first missions were in northern Algeria. In 1878 its members founded the first Catholic missions in the Rift Valley lakes region of East Africa despite great physical sufferings, disease, and persecution; and in 1895 the society extended its work to West Africa. The White Fathers try to live as far as possible in the same manner as the Africans, and their religious habit resembles the traditional clothing worn in North Africa: the white gandoura (a tunic) and burnoose (a hooded cape). The White Sisters, or Missionary Sisters of Our Lady of Africa, were founded by Lavigerie in 1869 to assist the White Fathers in their African missions.
