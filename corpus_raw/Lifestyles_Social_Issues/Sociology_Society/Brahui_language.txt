Brahui language,  isolated member of the Dravidian languages that is spoken in south-central and western Pakistan. In the early 21st century Brahui was spoken by more than two million people.
Brahuiâ€™s isolation from the other Dravidian languages (all of which are spoken in eastern, central, and southern India) has resulted in heavy borrowing from surrounding non-Dravidian languages, including Balochi, Sindhi, and Persian. In part because it is not a written language, Brahui is being displaced by neighbouring languages. Many of its speakers are already bilingual.
