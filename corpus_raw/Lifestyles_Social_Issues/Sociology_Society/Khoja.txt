Khoja, Persian Khvājeh,  caste of Indian Muslims converted from Hinduism to Islam in the 14th century by the Persian pīr (religious leader or teacher) Saḍr-al-Dīn and adopted as members of the Nizārī Ismāʿīliyyah sect of the Shīʿites. Forced to feign either Hinduism, Sunni Islam, or Ithnā ʿAshariyyah in order to preserve themselves from persecution, some Khojas, in time, became followers of those faiths.
The term Khoja is not a religious designation but a purely caste distinction that was carried over from the Hindu background of the group. Thus, there are Sunni Khojas and Shīʿite Khojas. Other Nizārī Ismāʿīlīs share the same beliefs, practices, and even language with the Khojas. However, one cannot enter the caste except by birth.
Khojas live primarily in India and eastern Africa. Every province with large numbers of them has an Ismāʿīlī council, the decisions of which are recognized as legal by the state. As Nizārī Ismāʿīlīs, Khojas are followers of the Aga Khan.
