Tatar language,  northwestern (Kipchak) language of the Turkic language family within the Altaic language group. It is spoken in the republic of Tatarstan in west-central Russia and in Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey, and China. There are numerous dialectal forms. The major Tatar dialects are Kazan Tatar (spoken in Tatarstan) and Western or Misher Tatar. Other varieties include the minor eastern or Siberian dialects, Kasimov, Tepter (Teptyar), and Astrakhan and Ural Tatar. Kazan Tatar is the literary language.
Crimean Tatar belongs to the same division of the Turkic languages. It has its roots in the language of the Golden Horde in the 13th century and was the official literary language in Crimea until the 17th century, when it was replaced by Ottoman Turkish. It was revived as a literary language in the 19th century but declined in use in the 20th century after Soviet leader Joseph Stalinâ€™s deportation of the Crimean Tatars. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, much of the Crimean Tatar diaspora returned to Crimea, which had become an autonomous republic of independent Ukraine. In the early 21st century, some 300,000 Crimean Tatars resided in Crimea, and the Ukrainian government conferred special status to Crimean Tatar as a minority language. See also Turkic languages.
