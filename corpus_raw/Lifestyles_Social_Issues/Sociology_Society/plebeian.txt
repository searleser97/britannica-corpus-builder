Plebeian, also spelled Plebian, Latin Plebs, plural Plebes,  member of the general citizenry in ancient Rome as opposed to the privileged patrician class. The distinction was probably originally based on the wealth and influence of certain families who organized themselves into patrician clans under the early republic, during the 5th and 4th centuries bce. Plebeians were originally excluded from the Senate and from all public offices except that of military tribune. Before the passage of the law known as the Lex Canuleia (445 bce), they were also forbidden to marry patricians. Until 287 bce the plebeians waged a campaign (Conflict of the Orders) to have their civil disabilities abolished. They organized themselves into a separate corporation and withdrew from the state on perhaps as many as five or more critical occasions to compel patrician concessions; such a withdrawal was termed a secessio. The plebeian corporation held its own assemblies (concilia plebis), elected its own officials (tribunes and plebeian aediles), who were usually more well-to-do plebeians, and kept its own records. An important step in the plebeian campaign was the achievement of inviolability of their tribunes.
The Conflict of the Orders was finally resolved in the final secession of 287 bce when a plebeian dictator, Quintus Hortensius, was appointed. He instituted a law (Lex Hortensia) making plebiscita (measures passed in the plebeian assembly) binding not only on plebeians but also on the rest of the community. In the later republic and under the empire (after 27 bce), the name plebeian continued to be used in the sense of commoner.
