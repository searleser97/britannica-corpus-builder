Maithil Brahman,   caste of Brahmans in Bihār, India (the area of the ancient kingdom of Mithilā), well known for their orthodoxy and interest in learning. The names of these Brahmans are usually followed by the appellation Miśra; many great scholars have been members of this caste, notably Vācaspati Miśra (9th century). They have no further endogamous divisions but observe a complicated pattern of marriage among five hierarchically ordered groups, each of which may take a wife from the group below it.
