Gotra,  lineage segment within an Indian caste that prohibits intermarriage by virtue of the members’ descent from a common mythical ancestor, an important factor in determining possible Hindu marriage alliances. The name (Sanskrit: “cattle shed”) indicates that the contemporary lineage segment acted as a joint family, holding possessions in common. Gotra originally referred to the seven lineage segments of the Brahmans (priests), who trace their derivation from seven ancient seers: Atri, Bharadvaja, Bhrigu, Gotama, Kashyapa, Vasishtha, and Vishvamitra. An eighth gotra was added early on, the Agastya, named after the seer intimately linked up with the spread of Vedic Hinduism in southern India. In later times the number of gotras proliferated when a need was felt to justify Brahman descent by claiming for one’s line a Vedic seer.
The practice of forbidding marriage between members of the same gotra was intended to keep the gotra free from inherited blemishes and also to broaden the influence of a particular gotra by wider alliances with other powerful lineages. The system was, to some extent, adopted by non-Brahman groups in order to take on some of the social prestige accorded Brahmans. Originally, the Kshatriya (warrior-nobles), too, had their own dynasties, the principal traditional ones being the Lunar and the Solar dynasties, to which the heroes of the Sanskrit epics the Mahabharata and the Ramayana respectively belonged. The epics do not present a sufficiently clear picture to determine the exogamy of such lineages; marriage alliances appear rather to have been motivated by territorial considerations. In later times, the Kshatriya and the Vaishya (merchant-traders) also adopted the concept of gotra in a fashion, by assuming for their groups the gotra of their adjacent Brahman gotras or those of their gurus (spiritual guides), but this innovation was never very influential.
