Academy of Sciences, in full (1917–25 and since 1991) Russian Academy of Sciences, Russian Rossiiskaya Akademiya Nauk,  highest scientific society and principal coordinating body for research in natural and social sciences, technology, and production in Russia. The organization was established in St. Petersburg, Russia, on February 8 (January 28, Old Style), 1724. Membership in the academy is by election, and members can be one of three ranks—academician, corresponding member, or foreign member. The academy is also devoted to training students and to publicizing scientific achievements and knowledge. It maintains ties with many international scientific institutions and collaborates with foreign academies. The academy directs the research of other scientific institutions and institutions of higher education. It includes departments of mathematics; physics; power engineering, mechanics, and control processes; information science and computer technology; chemistry and materials; biology; earth sciences; social sciences; and history and philology. Its membership is more than 1,500, with some 800 corresponding members, 500 academicians, and 200 foreign members.
Founded by Peter I the Great, the academy was opened in 1725 by his widow, Catherine I, as the Academy of Sciences and Arts. Later known under various names, it held its present name from 1917 to 1925 and took it once more in 1991. In its early decades, foreign scholars, notably the Swiss mathematicians Leonhard Euler and Daniel Bernoulli, worked in the academy. The first Russian member was Mikhail Vasilyevich Lomonosov, scientist and poet, who was elected in 1742 and contributed extensively to many branches of science. The society’s highest prize, the Lomonosov Gold Medal, bears his name; it was first awarded in 1959 and is traditionally given each year to one Russian and one foreign scientist. Under the tsars, the academy was headed by members of court circles and controlled a small number of institutions. After 1917 the academy chose its president and expanded its activities as new scientific institutions arose throughout the Soviet Union. By 1934, when it transferred from St. Petersburg to Moscow, it embraced 25 institutes. Before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the academy directed more than 260 institutions, including laboratories, naval institutes, observatories, research stations, and scientific societies, and its branches were spread throughout the Soviet Union. Since 1999 the date of the academy’s founding, February 8, has been observed as a national day of science.
