Old Saxon language, also called Old Low German,  earliest recorded form of Low German, spoken by the Saxon tribes between the Rhine and Elbe rivers and between the North Sea and the Harz Mountains from the 9th until the 12th century. A distinctive characteristic of Old Saxon, shared with Old Frisian and Old English, is its preservation of the voiceless stops (p, t, k) common to all Germanic languages; in High German these stops were affricates (pf, tz, kh) or long fricatives (ff, ss, hh). The Heliand, a life of Christ in alliterative verse written about 830, and a fragment of a translation of Genesis are the most significant Old Saxon literary works that have survived, although a number of minor fragments also exist. The modern Low German dialects developed from Old Saxon. See also German language.
