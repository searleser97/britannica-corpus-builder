Lord,  in the British Isles, a general title for a prince or sovereign or for a feudal superior (especially a feudal tenant who holds directly from the king, i.e., a baron). In the United Kingdom the title today denotes a peer of the realm, whether or not he sits in Parliament as a member of the House of Lords. Before the Hanoverian succession, before the use of “prince” became settled practice, royal sons were styled Lord Forename or the Lord Forename.
The prefix “lord” is ordinarily used as a less formal alternative to the full title (whether held by right or by courtesy) of marquess, earl, or viscount and is always so used in the case of a peerage baron (particularly in the peerage of Scotland, where it remains the only correct usage at all times). Where the name is territorial, the “of” is dropped—thus the Marquess of A. but Lord A. The younger sons of a duke or marquess have, by courtesy, the title of lord prefixed to their forename and surname—e.g., Lord John Russell (as a younger son of the Duke of Bedford).
In the case of a diocesan bishop his proper title is the Lord Bishop of A., whether he is a spiritual peer or not. Some high officials of the cabinet have the word lord prefixed to their titles, e.g., First Lord of the Treasury (the prime minister), Lord High Chancellor, Lord President of the Council, and Lord Privy Seal. In certain cases the members of a board that has taken the place of an office of state are known as lords commissioners—e.g., Lords of the Treasury and civil or naval Lords of the Admiralty.
The form of address “my lord” is properly used not only for bishops and those of the nobility to whom the title of lord is applicable but also, among others, for all judges of the high court in England, when in their judicial capacity, and in Scotland for Lord Provosts (in office) and Lords of Session (for life). It is not used for lords of the manor, a position which accords no rank or title.
