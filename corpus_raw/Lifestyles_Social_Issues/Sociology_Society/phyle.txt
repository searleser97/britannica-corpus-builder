Phyle, plural Phylae,  any of several “tribes” that formed the largest political subgroups within all Dorian and most Ionian Greek city-states in antiquity. The phylae were at one and the same time kinship groups embracing all citizens; corporations with their own officials and priests; and local units for administrative and military purposes. Sometimes the phylae of a state would be altered after a change in the form of government or makeup of the body of citizens. The original phylae of Athens were the Geleontes, Hopletes, Argadeis, and Aegicoreis (found sometimes in other Ionian states also).
At Athens the old phylae, which were dominated by the nobles and excluded a large number of new citizens, were supplanted by 10 new phylae in Cleisthenes’ political reorganization (508/507 bc). They were, in their official order, Erechtheis, Aegeis, Pandionis, Leontis, Acamantis, Oeneis, Cecropis, Hippothontis, Aeantis, and Antiochis. Enrollment depended upon residence when the reform was instituted; thereafter membership was transmitted by descent. The governmental organs and personnel of the Athenian democracy were based on the phylae: the nine archons (magistrates) plus their secretary, the 10 stratēgoi (“generals”), and others were each chosen from a specific phyle; each of the 10 prytaneis (executive committees) of the Boule (council) of 500 represented a phyle; the 10 regiments of hoplites and 10 cavalry detachments were each drawn from a particular phyle. In dramatic competitions at festivals each phyle was represented by a choros and a chorēgos (“producer”). In the Hellenistic and Roman periods some new phylae were added to honour certain rulers; altogether their number usually did not exceed 12.
The original three Doric phylae at Sparta were supplanted by five local phylae (c. 8th century bc) from which the five ephors (magistrates) and the five lochoi (regiments) of the Spartan army were recruited.
