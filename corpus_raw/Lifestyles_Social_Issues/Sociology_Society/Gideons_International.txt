Gideons International,  organization of Protestant business and professional lay men that places copies of the Bible or New Testament in hotel rooms, hospitals, penal institutions, schools, and other locations. Organized by three travelling salesmen in Janesville, Wis., on July 1, 1899, the association began placing Bibles in November 1908. During World War II the Gideons supplied the U.S. armed forces with “Service Testaments.” Their work is supported through freewill offerings. Their emblem, referencing Gideon’s victory over the Midianites in the Book of Judges, is a two-handled pitcher and torch. The organization claims 260,000 members in over 180 countries and claims to have distributed about 1.3 billion bibles worldwide since its founding. The national offices are located in Nashville.
