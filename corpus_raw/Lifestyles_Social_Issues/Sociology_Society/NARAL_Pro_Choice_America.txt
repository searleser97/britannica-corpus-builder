NARAL Pro-Choice America,  formerly (1969–73) National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws (NARAL), and (1973–2003) National Abortion Rights Action League,  American organization, founded in 1969 to centralize state abortion-rights efforts and continuing its mission thereafter to protect and promote reproductive freedom. The organization consists of three related entities: NARAL Pro-Choice America, Inc., a nonprofit organization that focuses on defending abortion rights and on making abortions less necessary; NARAL Pro-Choice America PAC, a registered political action committee that backs pro-choice political candidates; and the NARAL Pro-Choice America Foundation, a charitable organization devoted to educating the public about reproductive rights.
An early form of the organization was established in 1969, when a group of abortion-rights activists—including Betty Friedan—founded the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws. The goal of the organization was to consolidate and strengthen the efforts of state abortion-rights groups under the aegis of the first national pro-choice organization. In its early years the organization orchestrated lobbying efforts in states and organized grassroots demonstrations. In 1973, with the Roe v. Wade ruling securing women’s right to have abortions, the organization adopted a new name, the National Abortion Rights Action League, and concentrated on identifying allies in the federal government.
NARAL-PAC ranks as one of the wealthiest single-issue political action committees and has been credited with supplying crucial support for close races. NARAL is also noted for its highly effective media campaigns. In 1991 the NARAL Foundation unveiled a new campaign to take some of the focus off abortion and emphasize the necessity of keeping available a full range of reproductive health services. The organization once again changed its name in 2003, becoming NARAL Pro-Choice America.
