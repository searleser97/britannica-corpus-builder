Vasily Vladimirovich Bartold, also called Wilhelm Barthold,  (born November 15 [November 3, Old Style], 1869, St. Petersburg, Russia—died  August 19, 1930, Leningrad [St. Petersburg]), Russian anthropologist who made valuable contributions to the study of the social and cultural history of Islam and of the Tajik Iranians and literate Turkic peoples of Central Asia.
Bartold joined the faculty of the University of St. Petersburg in 1901 and for the rest of his life devoted himself to teaching and research, interrupted by frequent, extended field trips. His studies ranged from broader questions, such as those of cultural history, to more delimited, specialized histories. The interaction of the individual with society was of particular interest to him, and he also worked to refine the theory of his colleague Vasily Radlov on the formation of Turkic states through usurpation of popular authority by a powerful individual. His major works appeared in nine volumes; translations include Four Studies on the History of Central Asia, 3 vol. (1956–62), and Turkestan Down to the Mongol Invasion (1928). Bartold contributed many articles to The Encyclopaedia of Islam; especially noteworthy are his portraits of peoples of the Caucasus and Asia, including the Kalmyks, Kazaks, and Kyrgyz.
