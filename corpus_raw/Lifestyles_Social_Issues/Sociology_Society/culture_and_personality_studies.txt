Culture-and-personality studies, also called psychological anthropology,  branch of cultural anthropology that seeks to determine the range of personality types extant in a given culture and to discern where, on a continuum from ideal to perverse, the culture places each type. The type perceived as ideal within a culture is then referred to as the “personality” of the culture itself, as with duty-bound stoicism among the English and personal restraint among traditional Pueblo Indians.
Culture-and-personality studies apply the methods of psychology to the field of anthropology, including in-depth interviews, role playing, Rorschach tests, elaborate biographies, studies of family roles, and dream interpretation. Most popular in the 1930s and ’40s, psychological anthropology is exemplified by the works of American anthropologist Ruth Benedict, especially Patterns of Culture (1934) and The Chrysanthemum and the Sword (1946). Benedict and other proponents of culture-and-personality studies directed the attention of anthropologists to the symbolic meanings and emotional significance of cultural features that had hitherto been considered primarily through functional analysis; at the same time, they led psychologists to recognize the existence of an inevitable cultural component in all processes of perception, motivation, and learning.
Culture-and-personality studies lost traction in the 1960s and ’70s, an era characterized by shifting scholarly sensibilities and the critical reexamination of many fundamental anthropological concepts.
