California Academy of Sciences (CAS),  in San Francisco, oldest scientific institution in the western United States (incorporated 1853). The academy is situated in Golden Gate Park. Since the building’s redesign (completed 2008) by the Italian architect Renzo Piano, it includes a number of museums under one roof—the Living Roof, covered with native California plants and complete with hillocks that echo the city’s landscape. The roof was designed to aid in cooling the building naturally during daylight hours while capturing rainwater and converting carbon dioxide into oxygen. The CAS contains a multistory rainforest, a planetarium, an aquarium, a coral reef, a permanent African wildlife exhibit with live South African penguins, and many additional features. Its research library holds more than 230,000 volumes. The vast collection of some 7.5 million mounted insects in the department of entomology is one of the largest in the United States. Publications include the quarterly magazine California Wild (since 1997; formerly the bimonthly Pacific Discovery).
