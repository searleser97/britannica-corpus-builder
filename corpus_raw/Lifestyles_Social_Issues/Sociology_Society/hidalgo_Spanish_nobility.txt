Hidalgo,   in Spain, a hereditary noble or, in the later Middle Ages and the modern era, a knight or member of the gentry.
The term appeared in the 12th century as fidalgus, or Castilian hidalgo, supposedly a contraction of hijo de algo, “son of something,” and it applied to all nobles, but especially to the lesser nobility as distinct from the magnates (ricos hombres) and commoner knights (caballeros villanos). The hidalgos enjoyed some exceptional privileges and were dependent on rents or offices. By the 15th century they were probably thought of as being of Christian descent and thus distinguished from former Muslims and from conversos, descended from Jews.
The impoverished hidalgo is depicted in the anonymous picaresque novel Lazarillo de Tormes and in Cervantes’ Don Quixote.
