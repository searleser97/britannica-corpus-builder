Bigamy,  the unlawful contracting of a marriage by or with a person who is already married to another.
In earlier times bigamy was dealt with by ecclesiastical courts. After the Reformation, the English Parliament enacted statutes defining and punishing the offense, and similar steps were taken elsewhere. Such statutes vary in form and substance. Typically, they forbid marriage by or with any person “having a husband or wife living,” with specified exceptions for cases where the earlier marriage was invalid or was terminated by divorce or where the prior spouse has disappeared and is believed dead.
