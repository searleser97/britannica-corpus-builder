Nai, Sanskrit Nāī, also spelled Nhāvī,  the barber caste, which is widespread in northern India. Because of the ambulatory nature of the profession, which requires going to patrons’ houses, the barber plays an important part in village life, spreading news and matchmaking. Certain castes assign a role to the barber in their domestic rituals. Nevertheless, the barber’s social position is low because he also acts as a bloodletter and bonesetter, coming into contact with parts of the human body (e.g., bodily fluids) considered to be polluting. The consumption of liquor is permitted to the Nai, as is the eating of goat flesh, mutton, and venison.
