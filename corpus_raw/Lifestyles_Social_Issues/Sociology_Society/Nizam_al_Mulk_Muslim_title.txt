Nizam al-Mulk,  title borne by various Indian Muslim princes. The term is Arabic for “Governor of the Kingdom,” which also has been translated as “Deputy for the Whole Empire.” In 1713 it was conferred on Chīn Qilich Khan (Āṣaf Jāh) by the Mughal emperor Muḥammad Shah and was held by his descendants, the rulers of the princely state of Hyderabad, until the mid-20th century. The head of a ruling family was commonly known as the nizam.
