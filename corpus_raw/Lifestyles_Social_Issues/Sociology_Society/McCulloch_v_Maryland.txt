McCulloch v. Maryland,  U.S. Supreme Court case decided in 1819, in which Chief Justice John Marshall affirmed the constitutional doctrine of Congress’ “implied powers.” It determined that Congress had not only the powers expressly conferred upon it by the Constitution but also all authority “appropriate” to carry out such powers. In the specific case the court held that Congress had the power to incorporate a national bank, despite the Constitution’s silence on both the creation of corporations and the chartering of banks. It was concluded that since a national bank would facilitate the accomplishment of purposes expressly confided to the federal government, such as the collection of taxes and the maintenance of armed forces, Congress had a choice of means to achieve these proper ends. The doctrine of implied powers became a powerful force in the steady growth of federal power.
