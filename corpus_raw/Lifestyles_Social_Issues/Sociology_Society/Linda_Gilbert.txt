Linda Gilbert, in full Zelinda Gilbert,  (born May 13, 1847, probably Rochester, N.Y., U.S.—died Oct. 24, 1895, Mount Vernon, N.Y.),  American welfare worker whose efforts to provide library and other services to prison inmates met with limited success.
Gilbert grew up in Chicago from the age of five. In childhood her daily path to convent school took her past the Cook County Jail. She eventually developed an acquaintance with one of the prisoners and discovered from him that there was no reading material in the jail. Her resolve to establish a library in the jail was fulfilled in 1864 when she donated some 4,000 miscellaneous volumes. She then formed a plan to place libraries in every prison in Illinois and to provide other services for prisoners. As a fund-raising device she advertised a lottery, but the scheme came to naught.
About 1872 Gilbert moved to New York City, where in September 1873 she established the Gilbert Library and Prisoners’ Aid Fund. Her fund had to compete for contributions with such established agencies as the Prison Association and the Women’s Prison Association, and to that end she proved fairly adept at securing endorsements and publicity. Her tendency to the grandiose worked against her, however; a Grand Testimonial Concert at Barnum’s Hippodrome in April 1875 was poorly attended, and before long a general skepticism attached to her undertakings. Her Sketch of the Life and Work of Linda Gilbert (1876), published in the hope of attracting a permanent endowment for her work, made inflated claims. The Gilbert Library and Prisoners’ Aid Society (1876–83) was of genuine, if limited, service; prison libraries were supported, small personal items were distributed to prisoners, and support and sometimes employment were offered to released prisoners.
