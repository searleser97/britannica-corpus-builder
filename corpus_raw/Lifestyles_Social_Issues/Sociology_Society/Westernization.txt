Westernization,  the adoption of the practices and culture of western Europe by societies and countries in other parts of the world, whether through compulsion or influence. Westernization reached much of the world as part of the process of colonialism and continues to be a significant cultural phenomenon as a result of globalization.
Westernization began with traders, colonizers, and missionaries from western Europe who believed that their way of life was superior to those of the peoples in the countries to which they traveled. The occupied peoples were required or encouraged to adopt western European business practices, languages, alphabets, and attire. They were also encouraged to assume western European education systems, literary and artistic standards, and to convert to Christianity. Many countries had Western types of government and military practices imposed on them.
In the 20th century the United States, itself the result of western European colonization of North America, arguably became the most significant exporter of Western culture. Its movies, popular music, and popular fashion were taken up not only in Asia, Africa, and Central and South America but even in western Europe itself. Technology acted as both a form of and a transmitter of Westernization. Some leaders, including Kemal Atat√ºrk of Turkey and Reza Shah Pahlavi of Iran, embraced Westernization, but the tendency of Westernization to obliterate languages and cultural forms of other peoples also aroused widespread opposition.
