Mary Carpenter,  (born April 3, 1807, Exeter, Devon, Eng.—died  June 14, 1877, Bristol, Gloucestershire), British philanthropist, social reformer, and founder of free schools for poor children, the “ragged schools.”
Carpenter was educated in the school run by her father, a Unitarian minister. In 1829 she and her mother and sisters opened a girls’ school in Bristol. Later she founded a ragged school in a Bristol slum (1846), a reformatory for boys (1852), and one of England’s first reformatory schools for girls (1854).
In 1833, through the Indian leader Ram Mohun Roy and the Boston philanthropist Joseph Tuckerman, she became interested in India, which she visited four times. After her third visit (1869–70) Carpenter decided that she could supervise her model school for Hindu girls more effectively from England than in India. In the year of her return, she established the National Indian Association to inform English opinion on the needs of India. Three years later she visited North America and reported on the defects of the prison systems there, particularly in Canada.
Carpenter supported the movement for higher education for women and wrote pamphlets and books on ragged schools, reformatories, juvenile delinquency, and Indian social reform, all of which aroused interest and were responsible for legislation affecting reformatories and industrial schools.
