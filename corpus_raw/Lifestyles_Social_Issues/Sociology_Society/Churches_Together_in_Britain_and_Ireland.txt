Churches Together in Britain and Ireland, formerly British Council of Churches,  interdenominational Christian cooperative organization formed in 1942 by the Church of England and other British churches. It is concerned with ecumenical activity and with such social and cultural issues as environmental policy, immigration, and interreligious dialogue. The council has seven departments that carry out cooperative work for the churches: Church and Society, Church Life/Faith and Order, Global Mission, Inter Faith, International Affairs, International Students, and Racial Justice.
Membership comprises not only the Anglican and mainline Protestant churches in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland but also the Greek Orthodox church, the Coptic Orthodox Church, various Pentecostal bodies, and other denominations. When the Roman Catholic Church joined in 1990, the name of the organization was changed from British Council of Churches to Council of Churches for Britain and Ireland. In 1999 the council adopted its present name. The organization serves as the coordinating body and clearinghouse for four national ecumenical bodies: Churches Together in England, Action of Churches Together in Scotland, Churches Together in Wales, and the Irish Council of Churches.
