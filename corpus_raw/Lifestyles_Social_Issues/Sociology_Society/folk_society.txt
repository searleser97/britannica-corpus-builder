Folk society,   an ideal type or concept of society that is completely cohesive—morally, religiously, politically, and socially—because of the small numbers and isolated state of the people, because of the relatively unmediated personal quality of social interaction, and because the entire world of experience is permeated with religious meaning, the understanding and expression of which are shared by all members. The folk society is generally assumed to be the model of preliterate or so-called primitive societies that anthropologists have traditionally studied.
The most important and enduring modern effort to make the concept of folk culture relevant to anthropology remains the work of the U.S. anthropologist Robert Redfield, who saw folk society as including not only primitive groups but also peasant peoples whose operations entailed some degree of dependence on the city (see peasant). Although criticized for this interpretation of peasant life, as well as for underrating the impersonal and economic values and relations that may obtain in folk societies, Redfield’s construction of the ideal folk culture continues to be the authoritative ideal type. Especially significant characteristics of folk society, as Redfield saw it, are its self-conception as the vessel of the sacred (this conception endowing the moral order with absolute authority and rendering the life-styles rigidly conventionalized) and its quality of being the whole of social and spiritual reality, with functions satisfying all the needs of an individual from birth, through all his life crises and transitions, to death.
