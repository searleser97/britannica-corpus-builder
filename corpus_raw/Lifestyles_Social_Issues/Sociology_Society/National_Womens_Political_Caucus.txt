National Women’s Political Caucus (NWPC),  nonpartisan American political organization formed in 1971 to identify, recruit, train, endorse, and support women seeking public office. The organization endeavours to improve the status of women by amplifying the voice of women in government. 
To help women candidates run successful campaigns, the NWPC holds workshops that offer information about fund-raising, developing a platform, motivating volunteers, and obtaining media coverage. Since 1976 it also has worked to further the appointment of women to public offices, especially to important policy-making posts. To achieve this goal, the NWPC, working with other women’s groups, reviews the qualifications of hundreds of women and submits selected names and credentials to new administrations for consideration.
