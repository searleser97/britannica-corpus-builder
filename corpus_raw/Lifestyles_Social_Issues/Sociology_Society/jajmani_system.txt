Jajmani system, (Hindi: deriving from the Sanskrit yajamana, “sacrificial patron who employs priests for a ritual”)  reciprocal social and economic arrangements between families of different castes within a village community in India, by which one family exclusively performs certain services for the other, such as ministering to the ritual or providing agricultural labour, in return for pay, protection, and employment security. These relations are supposed to continue from one generation to the next, and payment is normally made in the form of a fixed share in the harvest rather than in cash. The patron family itself can be the client of another whom it patronizes for certain services and by whom it is in turn patronized for other services. The hereditary character allows for certain forms of bond labour, since it is the family obligation to serve its hereditary patrons.
The extent to which this system has ever truly operated in the Indian countryside is a matter of considerable debate. The jajmani ideal is suspect as the anthropological analogue of the same theoretical system presented by texts that describe a unified, conflict-free, reciprocal, and hierarchically weighted system of interrelated varnas (social classes). While aspects of jajmani relationships have been clearly attested in both the past and the present, and the influence of the jajmani ideal is something to be reckoned with, these are undeniably and increasingly accompanied by litigation, harassment, boycott, violence, political maneuvering, and a variety of monetized exchanges.
