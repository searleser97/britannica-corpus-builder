Caṇḍāla,   class of people in India generally considered to be outcastes and untouchables. According to the ancient law code the Manu-smṛti, the class originated from the union of a Brahmin (the highest class within the varṇa, or four-class system) woman and a Śūdra (the lowest class) man. The term is also used in modern times for a specific caste of agriculturists, fishermen, and boatmen in Bengal, more usually referred to as Namaśūdra. Some scholars consider the origin of the Namaśūdra to be an aboriginal tribe from the Rājmahāl Hills in Bihār.
