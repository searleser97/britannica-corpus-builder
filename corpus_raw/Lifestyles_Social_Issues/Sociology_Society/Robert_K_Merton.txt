Robert K. Merton, in full Robert King Merton, original name Meyer Robert Schkolnick,  (born July 4, 1910, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.—died February 23, 2003, New York, New York), American sociologist whose diverse interests included the sociology of science and the professions, sociological theory, and mass communication.
After receiving a Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1936, Merton joined the school’s faculty. In his first work in the sociology of science, Science, Technology and Society in Seventeenth Century England (1938), he studied the relationship between Puritan thought and the rise of science. He next served on the faculty of Tulane University (1939–41) and then accepted an appointment at Columbia University (1941), where he became a full professor in 1947 and was named Giddings Professor of Sociology in 1963. He served as associate director of the university’s Bureau of Applied Social Research (1942–71), which had opened under the direction of Paul Lazarsfeld one year before Merton’s arrival. The two men’s work was complementary: Lazarsfeld combined quantitative and qualitative research methodologies, along with his logic of concept clarification, and thereby influenced Merton’s orientation to historical studies. Moreover, Merton’s gift for theory influenced Lazarsfeld’s philosophical grasp of sociology. Their academic collaboration, from 1941 to 1976, strengthened the standards of training for the social sciences.
In Social Theory and Social Structure (1949; rev. ed. 1968), Merton developed a theory of deviant behaviour based on different types of social adaptation. He defined the interrelationship between social theory and empirical research, advancing a structural-functional approach to the study of society and creating the concepts of manifest and latent function and dysfunction. Other works by Merton include Mass Persuasion (1946), On the Shoulders of Giants (1965), On Theoretical Sociology (1967), Social Theory and Functional Analysis (1969), The Sociology of Science (1973), and Social Ambivalence and Other Essays (1976). He edited Qualitative and Quantitative Social Research (1979), containing papers in honour of Paul Lazarsfeld, and Sociological Traditions from Generation to Generation (1980).
Much of Merton’s work found its way into the mainstream. While at the Bureau of Applied Social Research, he began using focused interviews with groups to obtain reactions to such things as films and written materials. This technique gave rise to focus groups, which have become critical tools for marketers and politicians. Merton also coined colloquial terms such as “self-fulfilling prophecy” and “role models,” and he wrote at length on the concept of serendipity. In 1994 Merton became the first sociologist to receive a National Medal of Science. His son, economist Robert C. Merton, won a Nobel Prize in 1997.
