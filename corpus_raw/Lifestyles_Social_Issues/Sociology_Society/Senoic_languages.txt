Senoic languages, formerly called Sakai,  subbranch of the Aslian branch of the Mon-Khmer language family, itself a part of the Austroasiatic stock. The main languages, Semai and Temiar, are spoken in the Main Range of the Malay Peninsula. Together their speakers number some 33,000.
The former classification of the Senoic languages as a separate family of Austroasiatic, the Malacca family, is no longer valid.
