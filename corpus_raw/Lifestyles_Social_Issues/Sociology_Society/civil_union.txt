Civil union,  legal recognition of the committed, marriagelike partnership of two individuals. Typically, the civil registration of their commitment provides the couple with legal benefits that approach or are equivalent to those of marriage, such as rights of inheritance, hospital visitation, medical decision making, differential taxation, adoption and artificial insemination, and employee benefits for partners and dependents.
Depending upon the jurisdiction, such status may be available only to same-sex couples, to both same-sex and heterosexual couples equally, or to all same-sex and some heterosexual couples. (In some U.S. states, for instance, heterosexual domestic partnerships have been limited to couples in which one partner is over a specified age.) Some countries further parse various levels of commitment; prior to Swedenâ€™s enactment of same-sex marriage, for instance, heterosexual marriage and same-sex registered partnership conveyed similar rights and responsibilities, and a third status under Swedish law, domestic partnership, allowed both same-sex and heterosexual couples to commit to more-limited rights and responsibilities toward each other. Thus, while terms such as civil union, domestic partnership, and registered partnership are often used more or less synonymously, they may mean quite different things when used in specific jurisdictions. Although heterosexual couples do engage in these forms of registered nonmarital partnership, most couples who record their commitment through such means do so because marriage itself is not legally available to them. For further discussion of the issues involved in the legal recognition of same-sex partnerships, see same-sex marriage.
