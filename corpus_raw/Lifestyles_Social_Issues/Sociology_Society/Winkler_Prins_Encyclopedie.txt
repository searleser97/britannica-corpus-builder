Winkler Prins Encyclopedie,   the standard Dutch encyclopaedia, published by Elsevier in Amsterdam. The first edition (1870–82) was based on the German Brockhaus Enzyklopädie (q.v.). The 6th edition (1947–54) appeared in 18 volumes. A new, 25-volume, thoroughly revised edition was published in 1979–84 and entitled Grote Winkler Prins Encyclopedie.
The later editions of the encyclopaedia are known for their well-balanced articles, some of which are signed. Illustrations and maps are frequently in colour and in foldout form. Bibliographies contain works in various languages. The final volume includes an index.
