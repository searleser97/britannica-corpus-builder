Gregory Bateson,  (born May 9, 1904, Grantchester, Eng.â€”died July 4, 1980, San Francisco, Calif., U.S.), British-born U.S. anthropologist. Son of British biologist William Bateson, he studied anthropology at Cambridge University but soon thereafter moved to the U.S. His most important book, Naven (1936), was a groundbreaking study of cultural symbolism and ritual based on fieldwork in New Guinea. From 1936 to 1950 he was married to Margaret Mead, with whom he studied the connection between culture and personality, publishing Balinese Character in 1942. His interests broadened to include problems of learning and communication among schizophrenics. His last book, Mind and Nature (1978), synthesized many of his ideas.
