Melanesian pidgins,  English-based pidgins that are used widely in Melanesia; in some areas they have evolved into expanded pidgins, having become local vernaculars comparable to the creoles spoken in the Caribbean and around the Indian Ocean. Although some linguists once characterized this part of Oceania as having many varieties of a single Melanesian Pidgin, the present practice is to identify every island’s variety as a separate language. Examples include Tok Pisin, the urban vernacular and lingua franca of Papua New Guinea, where there are several hundred native languages; Bislama, in Vanuatu; and Pijin, in the Solomon Islands.
The vocabulary of Melanesian pidgins originally derived primarily from English; about 1,500 English words make up approximately 90 percent of the basic vocabulary that is used in most varieties. These words have in many cases widened or shifted their meanings, and compound words and other new constructions have further enlarged the vocabulary. Most of the pidgins’ grammar and syntax are also based on English patterns, although they have been much simplified and modified through usage and the influence of individual Melanesian languages.
Although there is a great deal of variety from one Melanesian pidgin to the next, their patterns of pronunciation and stress have clearly been affected by broad commonalities among the Melanesian languages. Stress has been shifted to the first syllable of the word in all cases, resulting in forms such as bíkos ‘because’ and másin ‘machine.’ The sound system has also evolved from English in that the sounds /f/ and /p/, and /s/, /sh/, and /ch/, are not distinguished, resulting in words such as pinis ‘finish,’ sap ‘sharp,’ and sok ‘chalk.’ The phonemes /θ/ and /ð/ corresponding to the spelling th are not pronounced as in English, instead becoming /t/ or /d/ or occasionally /r/: dispela ‘this fellow,’ tri ‘three,’ arapela ‘other fellow.’ Also, when positioned between two vowels, /b/ and /d/ often become /mb/ and /nd/, respectively: /tambak/ for tabak ‘tobacco’ and /sindaun/ for sidaun ‘sit, sit down, set.’
