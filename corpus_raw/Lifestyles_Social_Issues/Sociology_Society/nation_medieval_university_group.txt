Nation,  in medieval education, the basic organizational form of early European universities. A nation was formed when groups of students from a particular region or country banded together for mutual protection and welfare in a strange land. In some universities nations were responsible for educating and examining students. Each one was governed by its own proctor, who was elected for terms varying from one month (at the University of Paris) to a year (University of Bologna). Through participation in elections and meetings, the students—many of whom later served on committees and councils of kings and princes—were exposed to the practical workings of constitutional government.
At Bologna, the original site of the division into nations and the model for this development in other universities, there were four large nations: the three Italian nations—Lombard, Tuscan, and Roman—and the Ultramontane, which included French, German, and English. Each nation was subdivided into smaller provinces to represent students in university assemblies. Nations were succeeded by studia generalia (“universal study places,” or gathering places for scholars), which became permanent university locations in the late 14th and 15th centuries.
