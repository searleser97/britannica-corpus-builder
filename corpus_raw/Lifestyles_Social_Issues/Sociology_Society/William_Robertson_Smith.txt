William Robertson Smith,  (born Nov. 8, 1846, Keig, Aberdeenshire, Scot.—died  March 31, 1894, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, Eng.), Scottish Semitic scholar, encyclopaedist, and student of comparative religion and social anthropology.
Smith was ordained a minister in 1870 on his appointment as professor of Oriental languages and Old Testament exegesis at the Free Church College of Aberdeen. When his articles on biblical subjects appeared in the 9th edition of Encyclopædia Britannica (notably the article “Bible,” published in 1875), the authorities of the Free Church took strong exception to them; in 1877 they suspended him from his teaching duties. He was formally tried, and in 1880 the assembly dropped the indictment against him. After a second attack on his opinions, he was again suspended; in 1881 he was removed from his chair.
Later that year he was appointed joint editor of Encyclopædia Britannica. He moved to Edinburgh and wrote The Old Testament in the Jewish Church (1881) and The Prophets of Israel (1882). He held academic positions at Cambridge University from 1883 and remained editor in chief of Britannica until the 9th edition was completed in 1888. His article “Sacrifice” (1886) and his book Kinship and Marriage in Early Arabia (1885) are important landmarks in the study of comparative religion. In 1889 he wrote his most original work, Lectures on the Religion of the Semites.
