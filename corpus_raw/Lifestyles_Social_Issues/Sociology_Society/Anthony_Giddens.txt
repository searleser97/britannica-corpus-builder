Anthony Giddens, in full Anthony Giddens, Baron Giddens,  (born Jan. 18, 1938, London, Eng.), British political adviser and educator. Trained as a sociologist and social theorist, he lectured at universities in Europe, North America, and Australia before cofounding an academic publishing house, Polity Press, in 1985. In 1997 he became director of the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), a position he held until 2003; he was later professor emeritus. An influential adviser to British Prime Minister Tony Blair, he had a concept of a “third way”—a political program not limited by the traditional left-right political dichotomy—that was seen as underpinning Blair’s Labour government. In 2004 Giddens became a member of the House of Lords and received a life peerage as Baron Giddens of Southgate in the London Borough of Enfield. He has written numerous books, including Sociology (5th ed., 2006), Europe in the Global Age (2007), and Over to You, Mr. Brown–How Labour Can Win Again (2007).
