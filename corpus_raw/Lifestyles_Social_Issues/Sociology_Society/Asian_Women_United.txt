Asian Women United (AWU),  American organization dedicated to reflecting and shaping public perceptions of Asian culture, particularly of Asian women.
Asian Women United (AWU) was founded in the San Francisco Bay area in 1976. It seeks to generate awareness of Asian culture and to chronicle American images of and attitudes toward Asian women. The AWU sponsors activities that build networks within the community of Asian and Pacific American women and encourages its members to retain their heritage and culture. Through the creation and distribution of literature and videotapes, the organization also seeks to expose and eliminate racist and sexist views of Asian women and to present an accurate picture of Asian culture. Among the books compiled by the AWU are Making Waves: An Anthology of Writings By and About Asian American Women (1989) and Making More Waves: New Writing by Asian American Women (1997). Videos include the series With Silk Wings: Asian American Women at Work (1983–85) and the documentary Slaying the Dragon (1988), which addresses the demeaning stereotypes of Asians—in particular, Asian women—in films and television.
