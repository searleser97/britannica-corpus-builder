Gustavus Adolphus Union, German in full Gustav-Adolf-Werk der Evangelischen Kirche in Deutschland,  worldwide organization for the spreading of the Christian faith. It was founded by the Lutheran superintendent Gottlob Grossmann at Leipzig in 1832 as a “living” bicentennial memorial to the Swedish king Gustav II Adolf, Protestant hero of the Thirty Years’ War killed at the Battle of Lützen. Organized to support Protestant minority churches in Germany and abroad, the union gave its first support in 1833 to a fledgling Lutheran congregation in Bavaria, and in 1842 it merged with a similar society in Darmstadt. Membership was open to all Protestants and also included a few Roman Catholics. Dues were invested, and interest was used to provide church and school buildings, pastors and teachers, and, after 1945, support for refugee communities. World War II greatly increased and spread the work of the organization. In the late 20th century the organization was expending about 7 million deutsche marks (about 3.6 million euros) annually.
