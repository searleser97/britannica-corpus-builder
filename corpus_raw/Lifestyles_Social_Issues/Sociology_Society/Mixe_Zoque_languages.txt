Mixe-Zoquean languages,  family of North American Indian languages spoken in southern Mexico. The languages in the family are divided into two branches, or divisionsâ€”Zoquean and Mixean.
Zoquean is spoken in the Mexican states of Chiapas, Tabasco, Veracruz, and Oaxaca. Gulf Zoquean languages include Soteapan Zoque (also called Sierra Popoluca) and Texistepec Zoque, both of which are spoken in Veracruz, as well as Ayapa, spoken in Tabasco. The two other language groups of Zoquean are Chimalapa Zoquean and Chiapas Zoquean.
Oaxaca Mixean, spoken in eastern Oaxaca, and Sayula Popoluca and Oluta Popoluca, spoken in Veracruz, are among the Mixean languages. An extinct language, Tapachultec, formerly spoken along the southeast coast of Chiapas, is also classified as Mixean.
