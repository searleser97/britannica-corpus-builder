National Association of Colored Women’s Clubs (NACWC), formerly (1896–1914) National Association of Colored Women (NACW),  American organization formed at a convention in Washington, D.C., as the product of the merger in 1896 of the National Federation of Afro-American Women and the National League of Colored Women—organizations that had arisen out of the African American women’s club movement. Its founders included Harriet Tubman, Frances E.W. Harper, Ida Bell Wells-Barnett, and Mary Church Terrell, who became the organization’s first president.
The NACW adopted the motto “Lifting As We Climb,” with the intention of demonstrating to “an ignorant and suspicious world that our aims and interests are identical with those of all good aspiring women.” Terrell established an ambitious and forward-thinking agenda for the organization, focusing on job training, wage equity, and child care. The organization raised funds for kindergartens, vocational schools, summer camps, and retirement homes. In addition, the NACW opposed segregated transportation systems and was a strong and visible supporter of the antilynching movement.
In 1912 the organization began a national scholarship fund for college-bound African American women. During that same year it endorsed the suffrage movement, two years before its white counterpart, the General Federation of Women’s Clubs. In 1914 the NACW changed its name to the National Association of Colored Women’s Clubs.
Into the early 21st century the NACWC continued its traditional community-based service projects, with equal pay and child care remaining as chief issues.
