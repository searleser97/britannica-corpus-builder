St. Oswald of York, also called Oswald of Worcester or Oswald of Ramsey,  (born c. 925, Britain—died February 29, 992, Worcester; feast day February 28), Anglo-Saxon archbishop who was a leading figure in the 10th-century movement of monastic and feudalistic reforms.
Under the spiritual direction of his uncle, Archbishop Odo of Canterbury, Oswald entered the monastery of Fleury, France, then a great centre of reformed Benedictinism. Returning just after Odo’s death (June 958), Oswald was in 961 consecrated bishop of Worcester by St. Dunstan, archbishop of Canterbury. Soon after his appointment, Oswald founded a small Benedictine monastery at Westbury-on-Trym, Gloucestershire. About 965, when King Edgar (Eadgar) of the Mercians and Northumbrians ordered the establishment of many new monasteries, Oswald founded Ramsey Abbey, Huntingdonshire, on a site provided by Aethelwine, ealdorman of East Anglia. From Ramsey, which had close ties with Fleury and became a great religious centre, Oswald founded several other Benedictine houses, including those at Winchcombe, Gloucestershire, and at Pershore, Worcestershire. He also brought monks from Ramsey to his cathedral at Worcester, where they gradually replaced the secular clerks.
In 972 Oswald was transferred to the archbishopric of York, being allowed to retain the see of Worcester, where he mainly resided. As an ecclesiastical landlord, he practiced the leasing of land to certain men and to their heirs on condition that they perform various services for him. He created leasehold tenures limited to three generations for tenants who owed him various services, especially riding services as messengers and escorts.
His support of Dunstan’s apostolate and his collaboration with Bishop Aethelwold of Winchester, Hampshire, in establishing religious centres rank Oswald among the chief contributors to Anglo-Saxon monastic reform.
