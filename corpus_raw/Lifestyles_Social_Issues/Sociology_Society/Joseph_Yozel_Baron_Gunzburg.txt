Joseph, Baron Günzburg,  (born 1812, Vitebsk, Russia—died  Jan. 12, 1878, Paris), Jewish philanthropist, banker, and financier who contributed much to the industrialization of 19th-century Russia and who successfully fought some of the discriminatory measures against Jews in Russia. His son Horace carried on his philanthropic work, and his grandson David was a well-known Orientalist and bibliophile.
After an early career as a contractor for the government, he founded a banking firm in 1859 in St. Petersburg. Along with other wealthy Russian Jewish families, he also financed the building of much of Russia’s railroad network. He was created a baron in the early 1870s.
Günzburg is best remembered for his activities on behalf of his persecuted coreligionists. In 1863 he helped found the Society for the Promotion of Culture Among the Jews of Russia, of which he was the first president, to “disseminate among the Jews the knowledge of the Russian language and other useful subjects” in the hope that thereby “the Jews will become full-fledged citizens of the country.” The society thrived, sponsoring translations of the Bible and other works into Russian and founding a number of Jewish cultural societies. Günzburg also succeeded in having discriminatory laws against Jews in military service removed and in gaining greater freedom of movement for Jewish merchants and artisans.
