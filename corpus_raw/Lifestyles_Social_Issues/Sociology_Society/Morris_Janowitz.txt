Morris Janowitz,  (born October 22, 1919, Paterson, New Jersey, U.S.—died November 7, 1988, Chicago, Illinois), innovative American sociologist and political scientist who made major contributions to sociological theory and to the study of prejudice, urban issues, and patriotism. His work in political science concentrated mainly on civil-military affairs.
After earning his B.A. at New York University (1941) and his Ph.D. at the University of Chicago (1948), he served as research assistant for war community research at the Library of Congress (1941) and as senior propaganda analyst of the Organization and Propaganda Section at the U.S. Department of Justice (1941–43) before accepting an academic appointment at the University of Chicago. He started as an instructor in sociology (1947–48) and rose through the academic ranks there and at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. He was appointed chair of the department of sociology at the University of Chicago in 1961, a position he retained until 1972. He collaborated with Bruno Bettelheim on Dynamics of Prejudice (1950), a psychological and sociological study of racial and ethnic prejudice. The Professional Soldier (1960) spurred increased interest in civil-military relations. He is also the author of Sociology and the Military Establishment (1959; revised 1965) and Social Change and Prejudice (with Bettelheim, 1964).
Janowitz served as Pitt Professor and Distinguished Professor at the University of Cambridge (1972–73) and as Kimpton Distinguished-Service Professor in the department of sociology at the University of Chicago. His The Last Half Century; Societal Change and Politics in America (1978) is a major synthesis of ideas on social control.
