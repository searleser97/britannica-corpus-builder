Free Church Federal Council,   organization of free churches (not part of the Church of England) of England and Wales, including Methodist, Baptist, the United Reformed Church in England and Wales (a Presbyterianâ€“Congregational merger), and some other churches. It was formed in 1940 by the union of the National Council of the Evangelical Free Churches (founded 1896) and the Federal Council of the Evangelical Free Churches (founded 1919) for the purpose of cooperating in matters of mutual concern.
The council is presided over by a moderator who holds office for one year. It works through local councils, which elect representatives to the national council and send delegates to an annual congress. The member denominations send direct representatives to congress and council.
