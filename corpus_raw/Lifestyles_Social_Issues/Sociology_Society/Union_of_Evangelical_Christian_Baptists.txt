Union of Evangelical Christian Baptists, formerly All-Union Council of Evangelical Christians and Baptists,  voluntary association of Baptist churches in Russia that was formed (in the Soviet Union) in 1944 by uniting the Union of Evangelical Christians and the Russian Baptist Union. The Baptists in Russia grew from religious revival movements that began in the 1860s and â€™70s. In Ukraine, groups of Russians influenced by German Mennonite settlers gathered for Bible study and eventually adopted Baptist beliefs. In Georgia, German Baptists gained converts and developed a Baptist community. These two movements united in 1884 as the Russian Baptist Union. Another group that was essentially Baptist in belief preferred to call itself Evangelicals and formed the Union of Evangelical Christians in 1908.
Baptists increased in Russia despite early persecution by the government, but by 1905 persecution lessened. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, religious freedom was declared for all, and Baptist converts increased rapidly. In 1929 the Soviet government began suppressing religion, but during and after World War II the government made some concessions to the churches. Baptist educational and social activities, however, were restricted. While the demise of the Soviet Union brought greater freedom for the Union of Evangelical Christian Baptists, a 1997 law passed at the urging of the Russian Orthodox Church (which was concerned about proselytizing) restricts minority faiths in Russia.
The executive body of the association is elected by delegates from the congregations at meetings that are held at least once every three years. The union claims more than 80,000 members and about 1,750 prayer houses.
