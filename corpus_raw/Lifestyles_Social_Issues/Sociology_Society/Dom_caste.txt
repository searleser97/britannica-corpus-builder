Ḍom, also called Ḍomra, or Ḍomb,  widespread and versatile caste of scavengers, musicians, vagabonds, traders, and, sometimes, weavers in northern India and the Himalayas. Some scholars regard the Ḍoms as originating from an aboriginal tribe. They list seven endogamous subcastes. The Ḍoms are completely outside Brahminic control. They have their own deities and an elaborate demonology. Considerable interest is attached to the Ḍoms because there is reason to believe that the Gypsies, who originally came from India, are an offshoot of that caste. This connection is indicated by their use of the name Rom for themselves, a variant pronunciation of Ḍom; Syrian Gypsies refer to themselves as Doum.
