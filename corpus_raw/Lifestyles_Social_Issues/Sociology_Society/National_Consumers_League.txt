National Consumers League (NCL),  American organization founded in 1899 to fight for the welfare of consumers and workers who had little voice or power in the marketplace and workplace. Many of the NCL’s goals, such as the establishment of a minimum wage and the limitation of working hours, directly benefited poor working women. According to the NCL constitution, it was “concerned that goods be produced and distributed…at reasonable prices and in adequate quantity, but under fair, safe, and healthy working conditions that foster quality products for consumers and a decent standard of living for workers.”
Under the leadership of social reformer Florence Kelley, the NCL worked to educate the public on issues of wages, hours, and working conditions. One of the organization’s chief tools during its early years was its “white label.” Employers whose labour practices met with the NCL’s approval for fairness and safety were granted the NCL’s white label, and consumers were urged to support only companies with the white label and to boycott those that failed to earn it. Throughout the 20th century the NCL continued as a broad-based consumer protection and advocacy organization and played a role in obtaining federal meat-inspection laws, workplace safety standards, and unemployment compensation. In 1992 the NCL established the National Fraud Information Center to provide advice and aid to victims of telemarketing and Internet fraud.
