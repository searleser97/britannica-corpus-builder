B. Seebohm Rowntree,  (born July 7, 1871, York, Yorkshire, Eng.—died  Oct. 7, 1954, High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire), English sociologist and philanthropist known for his studies of poverty and welfare and for his record as a progressive employer.
After attending the Friends’ School at York and studying chemistry at Owens College, Manchester, in 1889 he joined H.I. Rowntree and Company, the family cocoa and chocolate firm. He was instrumental in getting the company to establish a pension plan in 1906, a five-day week in 1919, and an employee profit-sharing plan in 1923.
He was an intimate of Prime Minister David Lloyd George, serving as director of the welfare department of the Ministry of Munitions (1915–18) and as a member of the Reconstruction Committee (1917). Concerned about poverty, Rowntree conducted a survey of working-class homes in York in 1897–98 and published his findings in Poverty: A Study of Town Life (1901), which became a classic in empirical sociology. A second survey, conducted in 1936, was published as Poverty and Progress (1941), and his Poverty and the Welfare State (1951) reported on a third survey of York. He was also active in labour-management conciliation.
