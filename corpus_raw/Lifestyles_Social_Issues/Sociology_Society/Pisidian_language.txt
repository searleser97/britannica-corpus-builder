Pisidian language,  poorly attested member of the ancient Anatolian languages. Documentation for Pisidian is extremely sparse, comprising some two dozen tomb inscriptions consisting only of names and patronymics. The specific form of the latter, with an -s suffix matching that of Luwian, Lycian, Carian, and Sidetic, points to Pisidian being a member of the Indo-European languages. The dating of Pisidian texts is difficult, but it is likely that the language was in use between the 1st and 2nd centuries bce.
