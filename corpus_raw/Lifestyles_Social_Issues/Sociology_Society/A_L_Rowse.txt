A.L. Rowse, in full Alfred Leslie Rowse,  (born Dec. 4, 1903, Tregonissey, Cornwall, Eng.—died  Oct. 3, 1997, St. Austell, Cornwall), English historian and writer who became one of the 20th century’s foremost authorities on Elizabethan England.
The son of a labourer, Rowse was a brilliant student and won a scholarship to Christ Church College, Oxford, in 1922. He studied modern history there, and soon after graduating in 1925 he was elected a fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, where he lived and worked for the next 49 years as a teacher and historian. He also took his master’s (1929) and doctorate (1953) from Oxford.
Rowse’s first book to attract attention, Sir Richard Grenville of the Revenge (1937), was a biography of an English naval commander during the time of Queen Elizabeth I (reigned 1558–1603). This was followed by Tudor Cornwall (1941), a vivid and highly detailed portrait of Cornish society in the 16th century. Rowse’s one-volume general history of England, The Spirit of English History (1943), was also highly praised, but his most important work is the historical trilogy The Elizabethan Age (1950–72). Its three volumes, entitled The England of Elizabeth (1950), The Expansion of Elizabethan England (1955), and The Elizabethan Renaissance (1971–72), respectively treat the social structure, overseas exploration, and cultural attitudes and achievements of England during Elizabeth’s reign.
Rowse narrowed his scope in 1963 with a controversial biography of Shakespeare and an annotated edition of the playwright’s complete works (1978). A 1976 work based on the diaries of a prominent Elizabethan even purported to reveal the identity of Shakespeare’s “Dark Lady.” Rowse drew much of his biographical information from Shakespeare’s works, and critics were quick to point out the lack of documentary evidence for information presented as fact. Rowse’s authoritarian tone and his failure to credit the work of other Shakespearean scholars were also noted with dismay.
He wrote several other biographies of English historical and literary figures, notably a two-volume study of the Churchill family (1956, 1958). Among his many other historical works are studies of the Tower of London and of sexuality in the Elizabethan age. He was also a prolific poet, and his autobiography appeared in several volumes, beginning with A Cornish Childhood (1942). His last book, Historians I Have Known, was published in 1995.
