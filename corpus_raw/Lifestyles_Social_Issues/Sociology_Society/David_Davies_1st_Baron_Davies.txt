David Davies, 1st Baron Davies, in full David Davies, 1st Baron Davies of Llandinam,  (born May 11, 1880, Llandinam, Montgomeryshire, Wales—died June 16, 1944, Llandinam), British promoter of the League of Nations, advocate of an international policing force to prevent war.
Davies was educated at King’s College, Cambridge, and was a Liberal member of the House of Commons (1906–29). He fought in World War I, after which he became closely associated with the work of the League of Nations. After the failure of the Disarmament Conference in 1933, he founded and acted as treasurer of the New Commonwealth Society, which worked to produce a more effective League of Nations with a police force and an impartial tribunal, with broad jurisdiction over international disputes. He wrote many books and pamphlets on this theme, including The Problem of the Twentieth Century (1930).
