E. Franklin Frazier, in full Edward Franklin Frazier,  (born September 24, 1894, Baltimore, Maryland, U.S.—died  May 17, 1962, Washington, D.C.), American sociologist whose work on African American social structure provided insights into many of the problems affecting the black community.
Frazier received his A.B. from Howard University (1916) and his A.M. in sociology from Clark University (1920). After being awarded a fellowship to the New York School of Social Work (1920–21), he accepted an American-Scandinavian Foundation grant to study folk high schools and the Cooperative Movement in Denmark (1921–22). He taught sociology at Morehouse College, a historically black institution in Atlanta, Georgia, where he organized the Atlanta University School of Social Work, later becoming its director. With the controversy surrounding the publication (1927) of Frazier’s “The Pathology of Race Prejudice” in Forum, he was forced to leave Morehouse. He received a fellowship from the University of Chicago (1927), where he took his Ph.D. (1931), and publication of his thesis, The Negro Family in Chicago (1932), sustained the university’s interest in his work on the black family. He taught at Fisk University (1929–34) and Howard University (from 1934) and was elected president of the American Sociological Association (1948). He served as director of the Division of Applied Social Sciences UNESCO (1951–53), where he worked on the Tension and Social Change Project, assessing the interactions between people of different races and cultures and the effect of these interactions on each community. In all such research, Frazier insisted on an approach that examined economic, political, and attitudinal factors that shape the systems of social relationships. His writings include The Negro Family in the United States (1939), among the first sociological works on African Americans researched and written by an African American. He also wrote Negro Youth at the Crossways (1940) and Race and Culture Contacts in the Modern World (1957), which dealt with African American studies.
