Andrew Fisher,  (born Aug. 29, 1862, Crosshouse, Ayrshire, Scot.—died  Oct. 22, 1928, London, Eng.), three-time Labor prime minister of Australia (1908–09, 1910–13, 1914–15) who sponsored important legislation in the fields of social welfare, economic development, labour relations, and defense.
Fisher emigrated from England to Queensland in 1885, worked as a coal miner and union leader, and was elected to the state legislature in 1893. In 1901 he served in the first federal Parliament and, briefly, in the first Labor government in 1904, assuming party leadership in 1907. His second term as prime minister was a fruitful one, advancing on the program of his predecessor, Alfred Deakin. Legislation was passed that created a commonwealth bank and a land tax to break up large estates, extended the Navigation Act to protect Australian shipping, and started a national navy. Fisher also brought about the provision of maternity allowances, the extension of judicial arbitration for labour disputes, and the beginning of a transcontinental railroad.
On reelection in 1914, Fisher led Australia into World War I, having pledged his country’s support for Great Britain to “the last man and the last shilling” in a famous election campaign declaration. Strain imposed by the war, however, forced him to resign his ministry in 1915, after which he served as Australian high commissioner in London from 1916 to 1921.
