Kate Harwood Waller Barrett, née Katherine Harwood Waller,  (born January 24, 1857, Falmouth, Virginia, U.S.—died February 23, 1925, Alexandria, Va.), American physician who directed the rescue-home movement for unwed mothers in the United States.
Barrett became interested in the issue of prostitution while helping her husband, Robert S. Barrett, a minister whom she married in 1876. She earned an M.D. from the Women’s Medical College of Georgia in 1892. The next year she opened a rescue home in Atlanta, which became affiliated with Charles Crittenton’s national chain of Florence Crittenton homes for unwed mothers.
In 1897 Barrett became vice president of the Florence Crittenton Mission, which operated more than 50 homes nationwide, and from 1909 until her death she served as the organization’s president. She guided the rescue-home movement away from its focus on prostitute reformation and toward a concern with the social welfare of the unwed mother, a shift that helped to make the unwed mother an acceptable subject of philanthropy.
