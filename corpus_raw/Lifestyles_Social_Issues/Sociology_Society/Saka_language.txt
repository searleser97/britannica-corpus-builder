Saka language, also called Khotanese,  Middle Iranian language spoken in Xinjiang, in northwestern China, by the Saka tribes. Two dialectal varieties are distinguished. Khotanese, from the kingdom of Khotan, is richly attested by Buddhist and other texts dating from the 7th to the 10th century. Most of these writings remain unedited. The other dialect, known from only one Buddhist fragment, is connected with Tumshuq. The texts are written in Brahmi script and contain many loanwords from the Prakrit languages of India.
