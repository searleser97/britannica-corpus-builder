Edwin Grant Conklin,  (born Nov. 24, 1863, Waldo, Ohio, U.S.—died  Nov. 21, 1952, Princeton, N.J.), American biologist noted for his studies of human evolution, who was a leading critic of society’s response to advanced technology.
Conklin became professor of biology at Princeton University (1908), where he remained as independent lecturer and researcher after his retirement from the position in 1933. Experimenting in the field of invertebrate embryology, he studied the egg cell, or ovum, and traced the formation of organs to their origins in the egg cell and embryo. Conklin also investigated the physical mechanism of cell division and became an authority on human evolution. As a widely respected scientist, he publicly pointed out the problems created by the impact of scientific discoveries on society and cautioned against maintaining archaic social attitudes in the face of a highly sophisticated technology. Conklin’s statements, made directly after World War II, were dramatized by widespread anxiety over the possible employment of nuclear weapons in future wars. Among his scientific publications are Heredity and Environment in the Development of Men (1915–21), Direction of Human Evolution (1921), and Problems of Organic Adaptation (1921).
