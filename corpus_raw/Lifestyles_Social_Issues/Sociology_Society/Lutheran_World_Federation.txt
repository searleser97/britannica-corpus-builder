Lutheran World Federation (LWF),  international cooperative agency of Lutheran churches, organized at Lund, Swed., in 1947. It developed from the Lutheran World Convention, which held conventions in 1923, 1929, and 1935. The effectiveness of the Lutheran World Convention during the war years was hampered because it had no constitution or defined organization. At the Lund conference in 1947 the Lutheran World Convention was reorganized into the Lutheran World Federation and a constitution was adopted.
The LWF is a free association of churches, whose combined membership approaches 55,000,000, and it cannot dictate to or interfere in the autonomy of the member churches. In its early years it was extensively involved in aiding refugees and others who had suffered because of World War II. Its various activities include mission, social welfare, and educational programs. Through theological study and discussion it encourages Lutheran fellowship and unity and ecumenical activities.
Since its founding in 1947 the LWF has held world assemblies, which are called by the president at intervals ranging from five to seven years. The president and other members of the executive committee are elected by the world assembly. The executive committee meets annually and is responsible for electing the general secretary, who is a full-time employee of the organization. Headquarters are in Geneva.
