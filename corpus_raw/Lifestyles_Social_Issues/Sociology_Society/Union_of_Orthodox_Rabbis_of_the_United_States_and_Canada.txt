Union of Orthodox Rabbis of the United States and Canada,  Orthodox Jewish organization founded in New York City in 1902 to foster traditional Orthodox practices, including strict observance of the sabbath and the dietary laws (kashruth). The union also hopes to insure that Orthodox Jews within their congregations will observe religious laws governing marriage and divorce. Rabbis belonging to the union are more conservative than those belonging to the much larger Rabbinical Council of America, many of whose members represent the “Modern Orthodox” movement that attempts to reconcile Orthodox Judaism with contemporary social and cultural life. Union members consist almost exclusively of European-trained, Yiddish-speaking rabbis, who elect the officials of their organization at an annual meeting.
