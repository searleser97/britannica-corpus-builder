William Fielding Ogburn,  (born June 29, 1886, Butler, Georgia, U.S.—died  April 27, 1959, Tallahassee, Florida), American sociologist known for his application of statistical methods to the problems of the social sciences and for his introduction of the idea of “cultural lag” in the process of social change.
Ogburn was a professor at Columbia University (1919–27) and the University of Chicago (1927–51). He frequently served as a labour mediator and was research director of the President’s Research Committee on Social Trends (1930–33) during the administration of Herbert Hoover.
Ogburn’s insistence on the verification of social theories by quantitative methods helped to shift the emphasis in sociology from social philosophy and reform programs toward the development of a more exact science of social phenomena. Ogburn considered what he termed invention—a new combination of existing cultural elements—to be the fundamental cause of social change and cultural evolution. Noting that an invention directly affecting one aspect of culture may require adjustments in other cultural areas, he introduced the term cultural lag to describe delays in adjustment to invention. Although lags are generally imperceptible over long periods of history, they may be so acute at a given moment as to threaten the complete disintegration of a society. For example, a major innovation in industrial processes may disrupt economics, government, and the social philosophy of a nation. In time, a new equilibrium will be established out of those disruptions.
Among Ogburn’s writings are Social Change (1922) and Sociology (1940; with Meyer F. Nimkoff).
