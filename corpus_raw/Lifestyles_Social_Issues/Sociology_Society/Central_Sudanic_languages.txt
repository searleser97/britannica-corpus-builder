Central Sudanic languages,  a group of more than 30 languages that form a subbranch of the Nilo-Saharan language family. The Central Sudanic languages are spoken in the Central African Republic, Chad, Sudan, South Sudan, Uganda, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Although this division is not universally accepted, the Central Sudanic group is usually divided into two main subgroups corresponding roughly to a geographic division into western and eastern. To what extent these two divisions also reflect a genetic subgrouping is not clear. The western division within Central Sudanic contains such languages as Bagirmi, Baka, Bongo, Jur Modo, Kara, Kreish, Morokodo, Sara, Sinyar, Vale, and Yulu. The eastern division includes such languages as Avokaya, Asua, Lendu, Lese, Lugbara, Lulubo, Madi, Mangbetu, Moru, and Ngiti.
