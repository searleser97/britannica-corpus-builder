National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA),  American organization created in 1890 by the merger of the two major rival women’s rights organizations—the National Woman Suffrage Association and the American Woman Suffrage Association—after 21 years of independent operation. NAWSA was initially headed by past executives of the two merged groups, including Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucy Stone, and Susan B. Anthony. The strategy of the newly formed organization was to push for the ratification of enough state suffrage amendments to force Congress to approve a federal amendment. Although some radical factions continued to address corollary issues, NAWSA’s new approach focused the group’s energies exclusively on recruiting new members and winning the vote for women. 
From 1900 to 1904 NAWSA instigated what was known as the “society plan” to recruit college-educated, privileged, and politically influential members and to broaden its educational efforts. Despite the failure from 1896 to 1910 of a single new state to ratify a state suffrage amendment, much of the organizational groundwork had been laid. After a split led by Alice Paul and her formation of the National Woman’s Party, NAWSA adopted the “Winning Plan” in an attempt to tap the energy and enthusiasm of the organization for a final push toward a federal amendment. Led by Carrie Chapman Catt, the organization coupled its drive for full woman suffrage with support of World War I and persuaded President Woodrow Wilson to throw his support behind what was to become the Nineteenth Amendment. Ratified by Congress in June 1919 and 36 states during 1919–20, the amendment was added to the U.S. Constitution on August 26, 1920, marking an end to a 72-year struggle.
