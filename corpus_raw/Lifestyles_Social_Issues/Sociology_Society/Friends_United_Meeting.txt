Friends United Meeting, formerly Five Years Meeting of Friends,  international cooperative organization that unites 20 yearly meetings (regional associations) of Friends (Quakers) for fellowship and mutual projects. It was formed in the United States in 1902 as the Five Years Meeting of Friends; the name was changed in 1965.
The yearly meetings refused to follow some of the more liberal ideas of the Hicksites (see Friends General Conference), who began breaking away from the orthodox yearly meetings in 1827. The meetings were subsequently influenced by the English Friends minister Joseph John Gurney, a systematic theologian and Evangelical leader who preached in the United States (1837â€“40). As a result, some of the orthodox Friends, the Gurneyites, adopted worship services with ministers presiding, gave more attention to creeds and scripture rather than concentrating on the Inner Light, and developed more active social and mission programs. A reaction to this movement was led by John Wilbur, a Friends minister who stressed traditional Friends teachings and mode of worship. This reaction led to further schism and the forming of Wilburite yearly meetings.
The Gurneyite yearly meetings held a conference in Richmond, Indiana, U.S., in 1887, and subsequent conferences led to the establishment of the cooperative organization in 1902. The organization today includes yearly meetings scattered across the United States and in Canada, the Caribbean, and East Africa.
In 2000 the group claimed more than 400,000 members. Headquarters are in Richmond.
