Burschenschaft,   (German: “Youth Association”), student organization at the German universities that started as an expression of the new nationalism prevalent in post-Napoleonic Europe. The first Burschenschaft was founded in 1815 at the University of Jena, and the movement spread all over Germany. The early groups were egalitarian and liberal and favoured the political unification of Germany.
After joint student demonstrations at the Wartburg Festival in October 1817 and the assassination of August von Kotzebue (a German writer who served the Russian tsar) by the nationalistic Burschenschafter Karl Sand in March 1819, the alarmed German governments passed the Carlsbad Decrees (q.v.; 1819), which in part provided for the official suppression of the Burschenschaften.
Thereafter, the clubs went underground until 1848, when they actively participated in the German Revolution. After German unification (1871), they adopted a new and aggressive nationalism that led many of them to subscribe to anti-Semitism and Pan-Germanism. Suppressed under Hitler, the Burschenschaften were revived in West Germany after World War II but no longer played a significant role in German politics.
