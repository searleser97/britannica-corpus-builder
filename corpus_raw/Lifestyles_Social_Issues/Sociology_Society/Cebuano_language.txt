Cebuano language, also spelled Sebuano, also called Sugbuhanon,  member of the Western, or Indonesian, branch of the Austronesian (Malayo-Polynesian) language family. It was spoken in the early 21st century by roughly 18.5 million people in the Philippines (speakers are spread over eastern Negros, Cebu, Bohol, western Leyte, the Camotes Islands, and the northern and western coasts of Mindanao). Cebuano is closely related to the languages of the Hiligaynon (Ilongo) and Waray-Waray, and it is sometimes grouped with those languages as a dialect of Visayan (Bisayan).
Cebuano speakers constitute about one-fifth of the population of the Philippines and are the second largest ethnolinguistic group in the country. Despite its spoken frequency, Cebuano is little used as a literary language, although newspapers and films both use the language.
