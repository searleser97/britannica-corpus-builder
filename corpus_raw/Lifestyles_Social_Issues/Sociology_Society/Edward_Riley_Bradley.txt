Edward Riley Bradley,  (born 1859, Pennsylvania, U.S.—died  Aug. 15, 1946, Lexington, Ky.), U.S. sportsman, gambler, philanthropist, owner and racer of Thoroughbreds, four of whom won the Kentucky Derby.
As a boy, Bradley worked in steel mills, then went to the Southwest, where he became a cowboy and fought Indians and was briefly a miner before he turned to gambling, which became a lifelong passion. Before the turn of the century, he opened a gambling casino in Palm Beach, Fla., the Oasis Club, which became a favourite haunt of celebrities. His Embassy Club, also in Palm Beach, was patronized and respected by social and industrial leaders who wintered in Florida. Advised by his physician that he needed to spend more time outdoors, Bradley bought the Idle Hour Farm, near Lexington, Ky., and became interested in horse racing, acquiring such outstanding horses as Blue Larkspur—whom Bradley and his trainer Dick Thompson considered his best horse, despite the animal’s losing the Derby in 1929 on a muddy track—Bimelech, Bridal Flower, Bazaar, Black Helen, and Bagenbaggage, in addition to the four who won the Kentucky Derby: Behave Yourself (1921); Bubbling Over (1926); Burgoo King (1932); and Brokers Tip (1933). Known for his blunt and forthright manner and for his superstitions, Bradley gave all his horses names beginning with the letter B. He also forbade his jockeys to carry whips. During the Depression of the 1930s, Bradley bought an interest in Hialeah Park in Miami.
In all, his horses won about 1,000 races and more than $2,500,000 in purses, but his expenses undoubtedly exceeded that amount. Bradley also instituted an annual charity race at the Idle Hour Farm, the proceeds of which went to Kentucky orphans of all races and religions. In 1940 he turned his Oasis Club over to the Catholic Institutum Divi Thomae for the founding of a laboratory of marine biology. Former governor A.O. Stanley of Kentucky gave Bradley the honorary rank of colonel.
