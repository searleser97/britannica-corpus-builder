Caran, also spelled Charan,  Hindu caste of hereditary genealogists, bards, and storytellers located in Gujarat state in western India, historically associated with the Rajput caste of Rajasthan. Many of their customs are similar to those of their northern Indian counterparts, the Bhaá¹­s; both groups had a reputation of preferring death to breaking a promise. The Caran compose their ballad poetry, which treats of warriors and kings, in a special western Rajasthan dialect, called Dingal, that is not used for any other purpose.
