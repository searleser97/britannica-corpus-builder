Thracian language,  language spoken by the inhabitants of Thrace primarily in pre-Greek and early Greek times. Generally assumed to be an Indo-European language, Thracian is known from proper names, glosses in Greek writings, and a small number of inscriptions, some of which appear on coins; these sources date from as early as the 6th century bc. Thracian is thought by many scholars to be related to the ancient Phrygian language spoken in Asia Minor. Compare Phrygian language.
