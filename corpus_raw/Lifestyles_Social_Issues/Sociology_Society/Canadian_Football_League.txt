Canadian Football League (CFL),  major Canadian professional gridiron football organization, formed in 1956 as the Canadian Football Council, created by the Western Interprovincial Football Union (WIFU) and the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union (IRFU). Though the IRFU still referred to their sport as rugby football, the member clubs played a gridiron style of football. The WIFU and IRFU became, respectively, the Western and Eastern conferences of the new league, which changed its name to the Canadian Football League (CFL) in 1958. Trusteeship of the Grey Cup, emblematic of supremacy in Canadian football, was transferred from the Canadian Rugby Union to the CFL in 1966.
