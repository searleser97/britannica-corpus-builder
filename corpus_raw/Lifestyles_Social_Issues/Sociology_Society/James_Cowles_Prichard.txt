James Cowles Prichard,  (born February 11, 1786, Ross, Herefordshire, England—died December 23, 1848, London), English physician and ethnologist who was among the first to assign all the human races and ethnic groups to a single species. He was also responsible for the conception of moral insanity (psychopathic personality) as a distinct disease.
Prichard received his early education at Bristol and early acquired knowledge of European and Oriental languages. After attending St. Thomas’s Hospital, London, he went to the University of Edinburgh, where he took his M.D. in 1808. Settling in Bristol in 1810, he was appointed physician to St. Peter’s Hospital in 1811 and to the Bristol Infirmary in 1814.
His Researches as to the Physical History of Man (1813) was expanded into a five-volume work (1836–47). In his classic Natural History of Man (1843), he concluded that there was but a single human species. His Eastern Origin of the Celtic Nations (1831) established the Celtic languages as a branch of the Indo-European family of languages. Prichard was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1827.
