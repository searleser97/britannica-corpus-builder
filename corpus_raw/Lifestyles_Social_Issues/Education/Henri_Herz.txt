Henri Herz,  (born Jan. 6, 1803, Vienna, Austria—died  Jan. 5, 1888, Paris, France), brilliant Austrian pianist, teacher, and composer.
Herz studied with his father and Daniel Hünten, then went to the Paris Conservatoire, where his teachers included Antonín Reicha and Victor Dourlen. He toured extensively in Europe, Russia, South America, and the United States, where he presented more than 400 concerts. From 1842 to 1874 he served as a professor of piano at the Paris Conservatoire and later founded the École Spéciale de Piano (“Special School of Piano”) in Paris. He was also a noted maker of pianos, taking the first prize at the Paris Exposition of 1855.
Modeling himself on Ignaz Moscheles (1794–1870), Herz became one of the most renowned pianists and composers of the late 19th century. Although his compositions, which resemble those of Johann Hummel, Moscheles, and Karl Czerny, were very popular, they were criticized for shallow virtuosity by commentators such as Robert Schumann.
