Agnes Scott College grew out of Decatur Female Seminary, organized in 1889 by members of Decatur Presbyterian Church, led by Reverend Frank Henry Gaines, who was the school’s first president (1889–1923). The school was named for the mother of Colonel George Washington Scott, a Decatur industrialist who in 1890 donated land, equipment, the first building, and money for a permanent endowment to the school. The development of Christian character combined with high standards of scholarship were among the college’s founding ideals. In 1907 it became the first accredited college or university in Georgia.
