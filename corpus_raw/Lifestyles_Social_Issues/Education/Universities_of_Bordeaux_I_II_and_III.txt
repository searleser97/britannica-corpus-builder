Universities of Bordeaux I, II, and III, French Universités de Bordeaux I, II, et III,  coeducational, autonomous, state-financed institutions of higher learning at Bordeaux, France. The three universities were established in 1970 under the 1968 Orientation Act, reforming French education, to replace the original University of Bordeaux, which was founded in 1441 and confirmed by papal bull during the reign of King Charles VII. The university played an important role in politics and church affairs; it even sent representatives to the great church councils.
From the 15th to the 18th century, the university produced such renowned figures as the essayist Michel de Montaigne (1533–92) and the French jurist and political philosopher Montesquieu. Its faculties of theology, canon and civil law, medicine, and arts were typical of European Renaissance universities. The university was suppressed during the French Revolution and replaced by faculties of the University of France. In 1896 Bordeaux was reconstituted as a university and given autonomy and state financing.
The modern universities have been restructured into study and research units, each having academic and administrative independence. Bordeaux I has units of law, economics, and sciences; it also has an observatory. Bordeaux II has units of medicine and life sciences and affiliated research institutes. Bordeaux III has units of letters and arts and of languages and a technological institute.
