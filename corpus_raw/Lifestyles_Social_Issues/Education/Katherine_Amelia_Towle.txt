Katherine Amelia Towle,  (born April 30, 1898, Towle, Calif., U.S.—died March 1, 1986, Pacific Grove, Calif.), American educator and military officer who became the first director of women’s marines when the regular U.S. Marine Corps integrated women into their ranks.
Towle graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1920. After several years as an administrator at Berkeley and at a private girls’ school, she resumed her studies in political science at Berkeley in 1933, receiving a master’s degree in 1935. From that year to 1942 she was assistant to the manager and a senior editor of the University of California Press.
In February 1943 Towle took a commission as captain in the newly established Women’s Reserve (WR) of the U.S. Marine Corps. Until September 1944 her duties were divided between corps headquarters in Washington, D.C., and the women’s training centres at Hunter College, New York City, and, from June 1943, at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. Promoted to major in February 1944, she became assistant director of the WR in September, advancing to lieutenant colonel in March 1945, and in December 1945 she was promoted to colonel and named director to succeed Colonel Ruth C. Streeter. Towle remained in that post until June 1946, when the WR was inactivated.
During 1946–47 she served as administrative assistant to the vice president and provost of the University of California, Berkeley, and in July 1947 she was appointed assistant dean of women. With the passage of the Women’s Armed Services Integration Act of June 12, 1948, the women’s reserve of the Marine Corps, like those of the other branches of the armed services, was integrated into the active line. Colonel Towle was recalled to active duty as director in October. Retiring from that post in May 1953, she then served as dean of women and associate dean of students at Berkeley from 1953 to 1962 and as dean of students from 1962 to her retirement in 1965. During her tenure as dean of students, she ordered that political activity on the campus be limited. The students reacted with sit-ins and demonstrations and formed a protest group, the Free Speech Movement, which kept student involvement and activism high for months.
