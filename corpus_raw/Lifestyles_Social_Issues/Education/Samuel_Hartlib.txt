Samuel Hartlib,  (born c. 1600, Elbing, Prussia—died  March 12, 1662, London), English educational and agricultural reformer and a tireless advocate of universal education.
After attending the University of Cambridge, Hartlib settled in England (1628) and associated himself with the educational philosopher John Dury, sharing his ideas on the necessity for the unity of the Protestant churches, school reforms, and teacher training. Hartlib presented treatises supporting the views of the churchman–reformer John Amos Comenius, such as A Reformation of Schooles . . . (1642). He also translated many of Comenius’ works, including Pansophiae, after which Comenius visited England (1641). During this time, Hartlib persuaded John Milton to write his pamphlet “Of Education” (1644), which Milton dedicated to him.
Among the more than 30 tracts and treatises published by Hartlib, Macaria (1641) is notable for its outline of a utopia based on the philosophy of Francis Bacon and Comenius. His plan for English education was set forth in Considerations Tending to the Happy Accomplishment of England’s Reformation in Church and State (1647), in which he proposed a labour exchange and an international bureau for the dissemination of religious and educational ideas. Hartlib further showed his concern for universal education in his many treatises on animal husbandry—e.g., his Essay for [the] Advancement of Husbandry (1651). He also advocated the founding of an agricultural college. His True and Readie Way to Learne the Latine Tongue (1654) was an effort to make learning available to all.
For his concern with the education legislation of the Long Parliament (1640–53) and his fight for the reformation of church and school, Hartlib was awarded by Oliver Cromwell an annual pension of £300, which ended with the Restoration (1660).
