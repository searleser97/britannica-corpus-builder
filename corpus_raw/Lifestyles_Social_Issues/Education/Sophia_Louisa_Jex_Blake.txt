Sophia Louisa Jex-Blake,   (born Jan. 21, 1840, Hastings, Sussex, Eng.—died  Jan. 7, 1912, Mark Cross), British physician who successfully sought legislation (1876) permitting women in Britain to receive the M.D. degree and a license to practice medicine and surgery. Through her efforts a medical school for women was opened in London in 1874, and in 1886 she established one in Edinburgh.
Jex-Blake attended Queen’s College, London, and then studied for three years in Boston and New York, returning to England in 1868. She was admitted to classes in medicine at the University of Edinburgh but was not allowed to take a degree. In 1877 she obtained the M.D. of the University of Bern and, through the King’s and Queen’s College of Physicians, Dublin, a license to practice in Great Britain.
