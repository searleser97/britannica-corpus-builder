Tobias Matthay,  (born Feb. 19, 1858, London, Eng.â€”died  Dec. 15, 1945, High Marley, Surrey), English pianist, teacher, and composer noted for his detailed examination of the problems of piano technique, the interpretation of music, and the psychology of teaching.
Matthay studied at the Royal Academy of Music and then taught there from 1876 to 1925, when he left to devote his full attention to the piano school that he had founded in 1900. His teaching method stressed development of proper piano touch and was based on a detailed analysis of arm movements. His books include The Act of Touch in All Its Diversity (1903), The First Principles of Pianoforte Playing (1905), Relaxation Studies (1908), Musical Interpretation (1913), and On Method in Teaching (1921). Together with his own teaching, his books brought him international fame and many pupils of distinction, including Myra Hess.
