George Birkbeck,  (born Jan. 10, 1776, Settle, Yorkshire [now in North Yorkshire], Eng.—died  Dec. 1, 1841, London), British physician who pioneered classes for workingmen and was the first president of Birkbeck College.
In 1799 Birkbeck was appointed professor of natural philosophy at Anderson’s Institution in Glasgow. There he started a course of lectures on science, to which artisans were admitted for a low fee. In 1823 he helped found the London Mechanic’s Institution, of which he was president until his death. In 1907 the institution was renamed Birkbeck College and in 1920 was recognized as a school of the University of London for evening and part-time students. The success of the London institution led to the establishment of similar vocational training schools all over Britain, some of which developed into technical colleges.
