Margaret Warner Morley,  (born Feb. 17, 1858, Montrose, Iowa, U.S.—died Dec. 12, 1923, Washington, D.C.), American biologist, educator, and writer, author of many works for children on nature and biology.
Morley grew up and attended public schools in Brooklyn, New York. She studied at the Oswego Normal School (now State University of New York College at Oswego) and at New York City Normal College (now Hunter College), graduating from the latter in 1878. She conducted postgraduate studies in biology at Armour Institute (now the Illinois Institute of Technology) in Chicago and at the Woods Hole, Massachusetts, marine laboratory. Morley then embarked on a career of teaching, which took her to several schools, including the State Normal School (now part of the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee), Armour Institute, and the Free Kindergarten Association Training Class of Chicago. Her work as an educator was eclipsed, however, by her career as an author of books on nature study and biology for children.
Morley’s pioneering writings, many of which were used as school texts at a time when nature study was beginning to be incorporated into many schools’ curricula, include A Song of Life (1891), Flowers and Their Friends (1897), The Insect Folk (1903), Little Mitchell, the Story of a Mountain Squirrel (1904), The Renewal of Life: How and When to Tell the Story to the Young (1906), The Carolina Mountains (1913), and The Apple-Tree Sprite (1915).
