National Women’s History Project (NWHP),  not-for-profit American organization founded in 1980 to “promote multicultural women’s history awareness.” 
The NWHP originated with the Educational Task Force in Sonoma county, California, the association that instigated the first Women’s History Week, in 1978. The organization’s first act was to coordinate the passing of a congressional resolution designating each March to be National Women’s History Month to promote a more equitable and inclusive version of American history. In addition, the NWHP contributed educational programming in 1995 for the 75th anniversary of the passing of the Nineteenth Amendment and in 1998 for the 150th anniversary of the woman suffrage movement. The organization also coordinates the Women’s History Network and provides training conferences for K–12 history teachers. 
With a focus on educating the American population about women’s history, the NWHP provides suggestions for community organizing that include local celebrations of National Women’s History Month, regional women’s halls of fame designed to honour the achievements of women in and around their hometowns, and the development of stories for local media about aspects of women’s history. The NWHP also coordinates suggestions for educators, librarians, media, local groups, and corporations interested in celebrating National Women’s History Month and increasing awareness about women’s issues.
