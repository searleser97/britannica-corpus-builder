Jacques Barzun,  (born November 30, 1907, Créteil, France—died October 25, 2012, San Antonio, Texas), French-born American teacher, historian, and author who influenced higher education in the United States by his insistence that undergraduates avoid early specialization and instead be given broad instruction in the humanities.
Barzun moved to the United States in 1920. He became a lecturer in history at Columbia University in 1927, obtaining a Ph.D. from there in 1932. Remaining at Columbia, he rose to dean of faculties and provost in 1958, emeritus in 1967. He assisted in the development of a two-year course for the reading and discussion of great books.
His works on education include Teacher in America (1945), essays; The House of Intellect (1959), a work that indicts the American educational system for producing counterfeit intellectuals; and The American University: How It Runs, Where It Is Going (1968, new edition 1993). A related work is Science: The Glorious Entertainment (1964), in which he criticizes what he considers to be an overestimation of scientific thought.
Noteworthy among his books on the arts are Berlioz and the Romantic Century, 2 vol. (1950; 3rd ed. 1969), Pleasures of Music (1951; reissued 1977), The Energies of Art: Studies of Authors, Classic and Modern (1956), Classic, Romantic, and Modern (1961), On Writing, Editing, and Publishing (1971), and The Use and Abuse of Art (1974). Simple and Direct (1975) is a rhetoric for writers, and the Modern Researcher (1962) serves as a primer for historical researchers. From Dawn to Decadence: 500 Years of Western Cultural Life, 1500 to the Present (2000) earned broad public recognition. His commentaries on performances at the Glimmerglass Opera festival in Cooperstown, New York, were collected in Sidelights on Opera at Glimmerglass (2001) and Four More Sidelights on Opera at Glimmerglass: 2001–2004 (2004). A Jacques Barzun Reader was published in 2002.
In 2003 Barzun received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United States. In 2007 he received the Great Teacher Award of the Society of Columbia Graduates.
