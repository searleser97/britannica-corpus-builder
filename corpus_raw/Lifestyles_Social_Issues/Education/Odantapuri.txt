Odantapuri, also spelled Uddandapura,  in ancient times a celebrated Buddhist centre of learning (vihara) in India, identified with modern Bihar Sharif in Bihar state. It was founded in the 7th century ce by Gopala, the first ruler of the Pala dynasty, no doubt in emulation of its neighbour Nalanda, another distinguished centre of Buddhist learning.
Odantapuri served as a model and inspiration for Tibetan Buddhists. Tibetan sources indicate that in 749 the Sam-Ye (Bsam-Yas) monastery was modeled upon it and that several distinguished Tibetan scholars studied there. It fell into decline during the 11th century, and it was probably sacked and destroyed, along with Nalanda, c. 1200, when Muslims under Ikhtiyār al-Dīn Muḥammad Bakhtiyār Khaljī invaded Bihar.
