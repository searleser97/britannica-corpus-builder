Hermann Lietz,  (born April 28, 1868, Dumgenewitz, Rügen, Prussia—died  June 12, 1919, Haubinda, Ger.), German educational reformer.
In 1898 he taught at the progressive Abbotsholme school for boys, founded in Derbyshire, Eng., in 1889 by Cecil Reddie. Lietz was impressed by the Abbotsholme system of education, which combined comprehensive individual instruction with physical exercise and recreation. By 1904 he had founded three Landerziehungsheime (country boarding schools), based on Reddie’s model, for boys of different ages, in Ilsenburg, Haubinda, and Bieberstein. Lietz eventually succeeded in establishing five more Landerziehungsheime.
