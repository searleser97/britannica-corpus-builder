The university was chartered in 1872 as Central University by the Southern branch of the Methodist Episcopal church. When shipping and railroad magnate Cornelius Vanderbilt donated $1,000,000 in 1873, the school was founded as Vanderbilt University, and classes began two years later. Initially, the university was divided into departments of academics, Bible, law, and medicine; preparatory classes were offered through 1887. The first doctorate was granted in 1879, and an engineering department was formed in 1886. The Methodists retained control of the university until 1914. The Graduate School was founded in 1935. In 1979 Vanderbilt acquired George Peabody College for Teachers, which originated in 1785 as Davidson Academy and developed into a leading teacher-training school. The Blair School of Music, founded in 1964, became a part of the university in 1981.
Noted Vanderbilt alumni include astronomer Edward Emerson Barnard, journalists Grantland Rice and Ralph McGill, surgeon Norman E. Shumway, critic Cleanth Brooks, poets Randall Jarrell and James Dickey, and politicians Theodore G. Bilbo and Albert Gore. After World War I the university became the home of the Fugitives literary circle, which included John Crowe Ransom, Allen Tate, Robert Penn Warren, and Donald Davidson.
