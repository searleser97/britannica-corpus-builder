Juilliard School, formerly Juilliard School of Music,  internationally renowned school of the performing arts in New York, New York, U.S. It is now the professional educational arm of the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. The Juilliard School offers bachelor’s degrees in music, dance, and drama and postgraduate degrees in music.
The school’s history began with the foundation of the Institute of Musical Art in 1905. Upon the death of textile merchant Augustus D. Juilliard in 1919, a large bequest was made to the Juilliard Musical Foundation, which was incorporated the following year. The foundation, which was directed to advance musical education in the United States, founded the Juilliard Graduate School in 1924. In 1926 the Institute of Musical Art and the Juilliard Graduate School came under the same board of directors and were combined under the name Juilliard School of Music in 1946. In the 1950s dance was added to the curriculum, and in 1968 the name was changed to the Juilliard School, reflecting its broadened activities, which included instruction in acting at the school’s drama division. The school is also noted for the Juilliard String Quartet, founded in 1946 and important to the development of chamber music in the United States. Total enrollment is approximately 1,400.
