National Congress of Parents and Teachers, byname Parent-Teacher Association (PTA),  American organization concerned with the educational, social, and economic well-being of children. The PTA was founded on Feb. 17, 1897, as the National Congress of Mothers; membership was later broadened to include teachers, fathers, and other citizens. There are 52 state branches, including one in the District of Columbia and one in Europe to serve American dependents on military bases. Within the national framework, local PTAâ€™s have a large measure of autonomy with which to design their own programs.
The stated purposes of the PTA are to bring the home and school into closer relationship so that parents and teachers may cooperate intelligently in the training of the child, and to develop between educators and the general public such united efforts as will secure for every child the highest advantages in mental, social, and physical education. Publications include The PTA Magazine and the National PTA Bulletin.
