Mother Marie Joseph Butler, original name  Johanna Butler,  (born July 22, 1860, Ballynunnery, County Kilkenny, Ire.—died April 23, 1940, Tarrytown, N.Y., U.S.), Roman Catholic nun who founded the Marymount schools in Europe and the United States.
In 1876 Butler became a novice in the Congregation of the Sacred Heart of Mary in Béziers, France. She took the name Marie Joseph. In 1879 she was sent as a teacher to the order’s convent school in Oporto, Portugal, where in 1880 she entered into full membership in the order. In 1881 she was transferred to a convent school in Braga, Portugal, where she became superior in 1893.
In 1903 Butler was directed to take charge of the order’s school in Sag Harbor, Long Island, New York. She also had responsibility for expanding the work of the order in the United States, and to that end, in 1907, she opened Marymount School in Tarrytown, New York. By 1919 the school had developed into a college for Roman Catholic women, and under her guidance it became a leader in Catholic higher education for the modern world. Other Marymount schools were established to spread the work of the original: in 1923 Marymount Academy of Los Angeles (now Marymount College in Palos Verdes Estates), in 1923 Mariemont in Paris, in 1930 Mariamonte in Rome, and in 1936 the two-year Marymount Manhattan College in New York City, which became a four-year liberal arts college in 1948. Marymount in Los Angeles merged with Loyola University to form Loyola Marymount University.
In all, Butler was responsible for the opening of 14 schools, 3 of them colleges, in the United States and 23 schools, novitiates, and other institutions of the order in other countries. She promoted in the Marymount schools an educational policy that emphasized social and physical training, along with religious and intellectual pursuits, and she established courses in political science and law to help train her students to become active and informed citizens.
In 1926 Butler was elected Mother General of the Congregation of the Sacred Heart of Mary, making her the first American head of a European-based Catholic order. In 1927 she became a naturalized U.S. citizen. In addition to educational institutions she founded the Mother Butler Mission Guilds for social service and instituted the retreat movement for laywomen. In 1948 her cause for canonization was opened.
