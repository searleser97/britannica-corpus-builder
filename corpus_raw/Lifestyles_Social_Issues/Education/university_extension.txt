University extension,   division of an institution of higher learning that conducts educational activities for persons (usually adults) who are generally not full-time students. These activities are sometimes called extramural studies, continuing education, higher adult education, or university adult education. Since its inception, group instruction in the form of formal lectures, discussion groups, seminars, and workshops has remained the core of extension courses. One important consequence of the extension movement was that it helped to establish higher education for women.
In 1867 an extension course was being offered by a University of Cambridge professor, and by the 1880s such courses were flourishing in centres throughout England. About 1885 university leaders in the United States became aware of the programs at British universities. The most significant development came at the University of Chicago when extension was included as an integral part of the design for the new university, incorporating provisions for off-campus centres, correspondence instruction, and various other programs.
At many American universities the number of adults engaged in extension programs has become greater than the number of full-time students enrolled on campus, and specialized units offering such programs have proliferated rapidly. Some universities reorganized themselves to give extension an important place as an all-institutional function paralleling that of resident teaching and research.
Elsewhere in the world, university extension has developed most fully in English-speaking countries. In some instances, following British practice, the term extramural studies is used.
