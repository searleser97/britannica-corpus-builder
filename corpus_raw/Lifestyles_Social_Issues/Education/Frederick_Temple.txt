Frederick Temple,  (born November 30, 1821, Levkás, Greece—died  December 23, 1902, London, England), archbishop of Canterbury and educational reformer who was sometimes considered to personify, by his rugged appearance and terse manner as a schoolmaster and bishop, the ideal of “manliness” fashionable during the Victorian era (1837–1901) in Britain.
Ordained a priest in 1847, Temple left his position as a lecturer at the University of Oxford, where he had been educated, in 1848 to work in the national Education Office. From 1850 to 1855 he was principal of Kneller Hall Training College and from 1855 to 1857 was a government inspector of schools. On the recommendation of the English poet Matthew Arnold, whose father, Thomas Arnold, had been a reformer at Rugby, Temple was appointed headmaster of the school in 1857. While serving simultaneously as Queen Victoria’s chaplain, he expanded the Rugby curriculum, especially in the areas of history, science, and music, and commissioned several new buildings.
Despite the controversy aroused by his contribution “The Education of the World” to Essays and Reviews (1860), which was considered too liberal in its religious views, Temple went on to establish his reputation as an educational reformer in his work for the Schools Enquiry Commission (1864–67). An Anglican convocation in 1864, however, censured his essay, and, upon his appointment as bishop of Exeter in 1869, the earlier opposition was renewed; Temple agreed after his consecration to withdraw his essay from future editions of the 1860 volume. Temple was named bishop of London in 1885. In 1896 he was made archbishop of Canterbury and thereby spiritual head of the Anglican Church. A year later, with the archbishop of York, W.D. Maclagan, he issued an emphatic rebuttal to Pope Leo XIII’s bull denying the validity of Anglican priestly orders. The two archbishops spoke together again in 1899 in a pronouncement that processional lights and the use of incense were illegal practices in Anglican liturgics. Frederick Temple’s son William was also archbishop of Canterbury (1942–44) and helped to further his father’s goals of educational reform, reflected in particular by the Education Act of 1944.
