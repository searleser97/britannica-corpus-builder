Philipp Emanuel von Fellenberg,  (born June 27, 1771, Bern [Switzerland]—died  Nov. 21, 1844, Hofwyl, near Bern), Swiss philanthropist and educational reformer.
In 1799 Fellenberg purchased an estate in Hofwyl, where he founded a self-supporting agricultural school for poor children that combined manual training with agricultural and academic instruction. He added a Classical institute for middle-class children, constructed gardens, established a printing press, and founded schools for girls and for the education of teachers. His social aim, to be achieved through education, was to try to raise the living conditions of the poor and to weld them and the upper classes together. Although he first worked with Johann H. Pestalozzi, the two men eventually separated over personal differences. Fellenberg’s socially oriented educational scheme initially provoked ridicule, but gradually pupils came to him from all over Europe, both for agricultural training and for the high moral training associated with his system.
