Team teaching,  approach to teaching dating from the late 1950s in which two or more teachers regularly share responsibility for the same group of students. It is usually practiced in elementary or secondary schools. There are two basic systems: hierarchic and cooperative. In the hierarchic system, a master teacher supervises one or more junior or assistant teachers. In the cooperative system, the teachers work together as equals, and leadership is determined not by status but by the requirements of the situation or the subject.
