Open University,   British experiment in higher education for adults. It opened in January 1971 with headquarters at the new town of Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire. There are no academic prerequisites for enrollment in Open University, the aim of which is to extend educational opportunities to all. Courses, centrally organized by a distinguished faculty, are conducted by various means, including television, correspondence, study groups, and residential courses or seminars held at centres scattered throughout Great Britain. The correspondence course, however, is the principal educational technique. Televised lectures and seminars merely supplement it.
