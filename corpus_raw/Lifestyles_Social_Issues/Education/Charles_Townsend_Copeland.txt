Charles Townsend Copeland,  (born April 27, 1860, Calais, Maine, U.S.—died  July 24, 1952, Waverly, Mass.), American journalist and teacher, who was preeminent as a mentor of writers and as a public reciter of poetry.
Copeland was educated at Harvard University (A.B., 1882), and, after a year as a teacher at a boys’ school in New Jersey and another at Harvard Law School, he was a drama critic and book reviewer for the Boston Advertiser and the Boston Post for nine years. In 1893 he returned to Harvard as an instructor in the English department, becoming assistant professor (1917) and Boylston professor (1925) until his retirement in 1928.
In his writing course at Harvard from 1905 Copeland had as students such later famous writers as poets T.S. Eliot and Conrad Aiken; historians Van Wyck Brooks and Bernard De Voto; journalists Heywood Broun, John Reed, and Walter Lippmann; playwrights S.N. Behrman and Robert Sherwood; novelists Oliver La Farge and John Dos Passos; critics Gilbert Seldes, Brooks Atkinson, and Malcolm Cowley; and editor Maxwell Perkins, who later edited Copeland. So great was Copeland’s popularity that his students founded an alumni association for him in 1907, which persisted until 1937. His Monday evening socials for students, with unannounced guests such as John Barrymore, Robert Frost, Ernest Hemingway, and Archibald MacLeish, became legendary. From 1906 to 1926 he lectured at Lowell Institute, Boston, in university extension courses on English literature.
His The Copeland Reader (1926), an anthology of selections from his favourite works, indicated the scope of his interests and was extremely popular.
