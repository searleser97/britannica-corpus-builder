University of Glasgow,  state-supported university in Glasgow, Scot. The university was founded in 1451 by a bull of Pope Nicholas V on the petition of King James II of Scotland. From 1460, lands granted by Lord Hamilton on High Street formed the site of the university until its removal to the west end of Glasgow in 1870/71. The Reformation caused the university to decline until Andrew Melville, the great Presbyterian scholar, revived it and drew up a new constitution for it that was confirmed in 1577. In the 18th century the university had among its teachers such eminent figures as the economist Adam Smith and the scientist Joseph Black. In the 19th century the university’s medical school became internationally famous with such teachers as Joseph Lister, professor of surgery, who did his pioneering work in antisepsis there. William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), the celebrated physicist, was professor of natural philosophy at the university in 1846–99. There are eight faculties: arts, divinity, law and financial studies, medicine, science, social sciences, veterinary medicine, and engineering. The Hunterian Museum is located on campus.
