Muskingum University,  private, coeducational institution of higher education in New Concord, Ohio, U.S., about 15 miles (24 km) east of Zanesville. It emphasizes an undergraduate curriculum in the liberal arts and sciences; a limited number of master’s degrees are also offered. There are four academic divisions—arts and humanities, science, social science, and education—and several interdisciplinary, pre-professional, and teacher licensure programs. Muskingum students are able to receive engineering and nursing degrees through Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, and a medical technology certificate is available through Southwest General Hospital in Middleburg Heights. Noteworthy facilities at Muskingum include the Boyd Science Center, the Louis O. Palmer Art Gallery, and the McAllister Biology Research Station near Otsego.
Muskingum College, which takes its name from a Delaware Indian word, was chartered in 1837 by a group of New Concord residents. Women were first enrolled in 1854. The institution grew in the decades following the American Civil War, and its initial classical orientation evolved into a liberal arts curriculum. In 1877 Muskingum became associated with the Ohio synod of the United Presbyterian Church. Since 1983 Muskingum’s affiliation has been with the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.). Muskingum attracted the former students of nearby Franklin College when that institution closed in 1927. In 2009 it changed its chartered status from college to university.
William Rainey Harper, the first president of the University of Chicago, and John H. Glenn, Jr., astronaut and U.S. senator, are among Muskingum’s alumni.
