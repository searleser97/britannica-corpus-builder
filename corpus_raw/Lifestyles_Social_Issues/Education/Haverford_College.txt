Haverford College,  private coeducational institution of higher learning in Haverford, Pennsylvania, near Philadelphia. Founded by the Society of Friends (Quakers) in 1833 as a men’s school, the Haverford School Association, it was the first institution of high education to be established by them. Non-Quakers were first admitted in the late 1850s, when it became a college; the school no longer has formal connections with the society. Haverford maintained close relations with nearby Bryn Mawr College, a women’s college, also founded by Quakers. In 1980 Haverford began admitting women as first-year students. Cooperative programs are still maintained with Bryn Mawr as well as with Swarthmore College and the University of Pennsylvania.
The college awards bachelor’s degrees only, and studies are primarily academic, with required courses in natural science, history, social science, literature, and aesthetics. A substantial percentage of graduates go on to postgraduate study. Total enrollment is approximately 1,100.
