Universities of Montpellier I, II, and III, French Universités De Montpellier I, Ii, Et Iii,  autonomous, state-financed universities in Montpellier, France, founded in 1970 under France’s Orientation Act of 1968, providing for reform of higher education.
They replaced the former University of Montpellier, founded in 1220. In the 13th century Montpellier was one of the great studia of Europe and maintained its high rank until the mid-14th century. Though founded as a centre of Roman Catholic learning, the university soon came under Jewish and Arabic influence and began to emphasize the secular studies of law and medicine. Placentius, a noted medieval jurist, is thought to have founded in 1160 the school that became Montpellier’s law school. The medical school was world renowned during the medieval period, and Gui de Chauliac developed the scientific method of surgery at Montpellier.
Montpellier was suppressed by the Revolution of 1789 and reconstituted as a university in 1896. Today, the three constituent universities are state-financed and academically autonomous.
