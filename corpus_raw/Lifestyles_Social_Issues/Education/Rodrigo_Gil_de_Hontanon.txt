Rodrigo Gil de Hontañón,  (born c. 1500, Burgos, Spain—died May 31, 1577, Segovia), celebrated Spanish architect who is perhaps best known for his treatise on architecture. He also designed several notable buildings in the Spanish style known as Plateresque.
Gil de Hontañón’s father, Juan, was the maestro mayor (official architect) of the Segovia cathedral and in 1525 laid the building’s cornerstone. After Juan’s death, Rodrigo took command of the project and executed his father’s plans. The cathedral of Segovia—as well as that of Salamanca, which he worked on after 1538—are both designed in a mixture of late medieval and Plateresque styles; both spaces have relatively  simple roofing. The mature Plateresque can be seen in Gil de Hontañón’s masterpieces: the Monterrey Palace in Salamanca and the University of Alcalá de Henares (completed 1553). The palace, only partially completed, is a richly ornamented and ponderous structure. The university, free of the few medieval and Mudéjar (Spanish Muslim) traces that still remain in the palace, is a work of remarkable elegance and harmony.
Gil de Hontañón’s treatise (c. 1538) is a compilation of medieval work on the computation of thrusts and the calculation of proportions. It reveals that, as late as the 16th century, architects had no standard system for calculating vault thrusts and buttress requirements.
