Kirsten Ralov, née Kirsten Gnatt,  (born March 26, 1922, Baden bei Wien, Austria—died May 30, 1999, Copenhagen, Den.), Danish dancer, ballet teacher, and, from 1978 to 1988, associate artistic director of the Royal Danish Ballet.
Ralov began studying in Vienna but soon moved with her Danish parents to Copenhagen, where she was accepted (1928) into the Royal Danish Ballet School with her brother, Poul Gnatt. Ralov joined the company (1940) and was one of its leading dancers until 1962. While there, she restaged a number of the ballets of the company’s one-time director, August Bournonville, for which she was made a Knight of the Order of Dannebrog (1952). In 1955, after accepting an invitation from Ted Shawn to appear in the Jacob’s Pillow Festival (an annual dance festival held in the Berkshires, Massachusetts), she toured the world, spreading the Bournonville technique—dancing and mime.
Upon Flemming Flindt’s resignation as director of the Royal Danish Ballet (1977), Ralov became the company’s associate artistic director, working with artistic director Henning Kronstam (1978–85). Under the joint direction of Ralov and Kronstam, the company flourished, visiting China in 1979 and the United States in 1980. Ralov released a record, The Bournonville School, and wrote a four-volume book of the same title (1979).
