Talmud Torah,   (Hebrew: Study of the Torah), since late medieval and early modern times, an elementary school under Jewish auspices that places special emphasis on religious education. Some Talmud Torahs concentrate on Talmudic studies as a preparation for entrance into a yeshiva (school of higher rabbinic learning), but others have broadened their curricula to provide a more general education in an atmosphere that is still predominantly religious.
