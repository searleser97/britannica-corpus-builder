Wilbur Fisk,  (born Aug. 31, 1792, Brattleboro, Vt., U.S.—died  Feb. 22, 1839, Middletown, Conn.), American educator and Methodist clergyman, principal founder of Wesleyan Academy and Wesleyan University in Connecticut.
Fisk studied at Peacham Academy and the University of Vermont and graduated from Brown University in 1815 (he received an M.A. in 1818). Licensed as a local preacher at Lyndon, Vt., in 1818, he was received into the New England Conference of the Methodist church in June of that year. While stationed at Charlestown, Mass. (1819–20), Fisk attended a camp meeting, where—according to his statement—he experienced “a supernatural work of grace leading him into a higher Christian life.” From 1823 to 1826 he was presiding elder of the Vermont district, becoming chaplain of the Vermont legislature in 1826. He was elected bishop of the Methodist Episcopal church (May 1836) but declined consecration.
His high repute as an educator did much to raise the estimate of Methodism in New England. He was a founder and principal of Wesleyan Academy, Wilbraham, Mass. (1825–30), and a founder and first president of Wesleyan University, Middletown, Conn. (1831–39).
