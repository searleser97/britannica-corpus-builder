Ljubomir Davidović,  (born Dec. 24 [Dec. 12, old style], 1863, Vlaško Polje, Serbia—died  Feb. 19, 1940, Belgrade), twice prime minister (1919–20, 1924) of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (later called Yugoslavia).
Entering the Serbian Parliament in 1901, Davidović helped found the Independent Radical Party in the same year. He was elected leader of his party in 1912 and served as minister of education (1914–17) in Nikola Pašić’s coalition Cabinet and in the first Yugoslav government (1918). As leader of the newly formed Democratic Party (1919), an office he held until his death, he presided over the Democratic–Socialist coalition government (1919–20). In July 1924 he again became prime minister at the head of a short-lived coalition of Democrats, Slovene Clericals, and Bosnian Muslims, supported by the Croatian Peasant Party. Davidović believed that a truly democratic government within a centralist constitution would gradually weld Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes into one nation, but his political experiences led him to promote a popular movement advocating a federalist state organization based on Serbian-Croatian-Slovene agreement and a parliamentary constitution.
Following his terms as prime minister, Davidović remained active in politics. In 1931, during the dictatorial premiership of Gen. Petar Živković, Davidović was one of the leaders of the United Opposition. This group stood against Živković’s Yugoslav National Party and, after 1935, the Yugoslav Radical Union of Prime Minister Milan Stojadinović.
