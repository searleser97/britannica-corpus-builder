Grammar school,   in Great Britain, secondary school that offers an academic course in preparation for university entrance and for the professions. Students usually begin attendance at age 12.
Before 1902, there was no system of publicly funded secondary education in Great Britain, and those students who were educated beyond the primary level attended either privately endowed grammar schools or public schools (which were also privately endowed, but were usually much older than the other grammar schools). The Education Act of 1902 established a system of new, publicly funded grammar schools and also provided government aid for some existing grammar schools. Technical training courses, attended mostly by those students who were not academically qualified for admission to the grammar schools, were also begun.
During the period between the two world wars, this system was modified. Students completing primary school at age 11 were required to take a series of examinations called the eleven-plus (q.v.). Results of these tests determined a student’s placement in a three-track secondary system. The highest scoring students were admitted to grammar schools and were likely to go on to university studies. The other students attended either modern schools, where they completed a course of higher level elementary studies and did not go on to university, or technical schools, whose most promising graduates were sometimes admitted to university.
Some British educators thought this system to be overly rigid, and after World War II many “comprehensive” schools, which combined elements of grammar, modern, and technical schools, were established, although many highly respected grammar schools survive. By the late 20th century the eleven-plus exams had become defunct and the vast majority of secondary-school students attended comprehensive schools, with a much smaller proportion attending grammar schools or technical schools.
