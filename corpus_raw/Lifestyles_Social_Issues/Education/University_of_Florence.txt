University of Florence, Italian Universit√† Degli Studi Di Firenze,  university that originated in Florence in 1321 and became later in the century, through the activities of the writer Giovanni Boccaccio, an early centre of Renaissance Humanism. Boccaccio secured a post there for Leonzio Pilato, whose rough Latin translations of the Iliad and the Odyssey introduced Homer to Italian scholars. In 1396 the first university chair in Greek was established there for the scholar Manuel Chrysoloras. The university later declined and in 1473 was transferred to Pisa. The large, modern University of Florence dates from 1859.
