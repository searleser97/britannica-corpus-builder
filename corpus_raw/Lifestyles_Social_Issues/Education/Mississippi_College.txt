Founded as Hampstead Academy in 1826, it was renamed Mississippi Academy in 1827 and became a college in 1830. In 1831 it became the nation’s first private college to award a woman a degree. The Presbyterian church purchased the school in 1842, but ensuing financial problems forced its return to the original owners in 1850—the same year that ownership passed to the Mississippi Baptist Convention. The Baptist church disallowed women at Mississippi College but, in 1853, founded the nearby Central Female Institute, which was renamed Hillman College in 1891. In 1942 Mississippi College subsumed Hillman College and again became coeducational. Graduate-level courses were offered from 1950, and the Graduate School was formed in 1975.
