Antioch University,  private coeducational institution of higher learning founded in 1852 as Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, U.S. It is noted for its experimental curricula and work-study programs. Horace Mann was its first president, serving from 1853 until his death in 1859.
Although the college from its outset was coeducational, nonsectarian, and committed to equal opportunity for blacks, its real innovations began in 1921 when its president, Arthur E. Morgan, undertook what has been called the first progressive venture of consequence in higher education, an attempt to combine “a liberal college education, vocational training, and apprenticeship for life.” Students were required to alternate their time between traditional subjects and full-time jobs, to give them experience of “actual living in actual society.” Antioch conducts cooperative and work-experience programs in many U.S. states and in foreign countries. The school has branches throughout the United States that offer liberal-arts courses of study. Campuses are located at Yellow Springs (the McGregor School for graduate work); Los Angeles and Santa Barbara, Calif.; and Seattle, Wash. The Antioch New England Graduate School is at Keene, N.H. In 1978 Antioch consolidated all its programs and adopted the name Antioch University. Notable alumni include social activists Olympia Brown and Coretta Scott King, television dramatist Rod Serling, anthropologist Clifford Geertz, and paleontologist and writer Stephen Jay Gould. In June 2008 Antioch College, the original flagship campus of the Antioch University system, closed its doors because of long-standing financial difficulties.
