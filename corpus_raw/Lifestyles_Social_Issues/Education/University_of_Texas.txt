Lawmakers of the republic and the state of Texas made several attempts to establish a state university, beginning in 1837. The state constitution of 1876 provided an endowment, and the state legislature in 1881 established a campus at Austin and a medical branch at Galveston. The University of Texas at Austin opened in 1883, and the Medical Branch opened at Galveston in 1891. The tower of the Main Building, a distinguishing feature of the campus, was erected in 1937. In 1966 a student atop the tower shot and killed 16 people and wounded 31 before he himself was killed by a police officer. Oil was discovered on university lands in west Texas in the early 1920s.
