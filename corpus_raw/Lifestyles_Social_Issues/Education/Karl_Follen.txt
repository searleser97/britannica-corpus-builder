Karl Follen, in full Karl Theodor Christian Follen,  also called Charles Follen,  (born Sept. 4, 1796, Romrod, Brandenburg, Prussia [Germany]—died  Jan. 13/14, 1840, aboard a ship on Long Island Sound, New York, U.S.), educator who was Harvard University’s first professor of German language and literature. He also was instrumental in establishing the first U.S. college gymnasium.
Graduated from the University of Giessen as a doctor of civil and canonical law (1818), Follen taught there and in the universities of Jena in Germany and of Basel in Switzerland between 1818 and 1824. His activity in revolutionary movements for German national unity and civic freedom precluded any extended academic career.
Follen went to the United States in 1824 and became an instructor in German at Harvard (1825) and professor (1830). He was a strong advocate of the new educational theories of J.H. Pestalozzi and F.W.A. Froebel, except in higher education.
Follen’s appointment as professor was not renewed, apparently because of his antislavery agitation; he resigned in 1835 and became a Unitarian minister. He was the author of several celebrated patriotic liberal songs, including “Horch auf, ihr Fürsten! Du Volk, horch auf!” (“Listen, You Princes! You People, Listen!”).
