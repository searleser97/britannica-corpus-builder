Christopher Columbus Langdell,  (born May 22, 1826, New Boston, N.H., U.S.—died  July 6, 1906, Cambridge, Mass.), American educator, dean of the Harvard Law School (1870–95), who originated the case method of teaching law.
Langdell studied law at Harvard (1851–54) and practiced in New York City until 1870, when he accepted a professorship and then the deanship of the Harvard Law School. American legal education at that time was a leisurely process, with no examinations or fixed requirements for the bachelor of laws (LL.B.) degree. Langdell raised the law program to university standards by instituting a regular progression of mandatory courses and tests. Later he devised the case method, so that students might read and discuss original authorities and derive for themselves the principles of the law.
A book by Langdell, Selection of Cases on the Law of Contracts (1871), was the first case-method text. Most of the early casebooks, however, were edited by James Barr Ames (1846–1910), a law professor at Harvard from 1873 and Langdell’s successor as dean. Eventually the method became universal in American law schools.
