Roger Ascham,  (born 1515?, Kirby Wiske, near York, Eng.—died  Dec. 30, 1568, London), British humanist, scholar, and writer, famous for his prose style, his promotion of the vernacular, and his theories of education.
As a boy of 14, Ascham entered the University of Cambridge, where he earned his M.A. (1537) and one year later was elected a fellow of St. John’s and appointed reader in Greek. The new Renaissance enthusiasm for the classics, especially Greek, was at its height.
Ascham’s Toxophilus (“Lover of the Bow”), written in the form of a dialogue, was published in 1545 and was the first book on archery in English. In the preface Ascham showed the growing patriotic zeal of the humanists by stating that he was writing “Englishe matter in the Englishe tongue for Englishe men.” He became Princess Elizabeth’s tutor in Greek and Latin (1548–50), then served as secretary to Sir Richard Morison (1550–52), English ambassador to the Habsburg emperor Charles V, traveling widely on the European continent. Thereafter, he was appointed Latin secretary to Queen Mary, a post he held until her death in 1558. He continued in this position for Queen Elizabeth I until his death. He served her by composing her official letters to foreign rulers and by helping her pursue the study of Greek.
The Scholemaster, written in simple, lucid English prose and published posthumously in 1570, is Ascham’s best-known book. It presents an effective method of teaching Latin prose composition, but its larger concerns are with the psychology of learning, the education of the whole person, and the ideal moral and intellectual personality that education should mold. His success in tutoring three females—Lady Jane Grey, Queen Mary, and Queen Elizabeth—has led some to consider Ascham an early proponent of education for girls.
