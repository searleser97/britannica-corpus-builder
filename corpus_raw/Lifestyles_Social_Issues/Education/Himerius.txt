Himerius,  (born ad 315, Prusa, Bithyniaâ€”died ad 386), Greek rhetorician, influential teacher and practitioner of the florid style popular in the 4th century.
Educated in Athens, he for a time conducted a school there, which attracted numerous pupils, many of whom (e.g., Gregory of Nazianzus and Basil of Caesarea) later became famous. The emperor Julian called Himerius to Antioch in 362 to reside at his court, and he returned to Athens in 368. He wrote 80 orations and declamations of which only 24 survive complete. His prose, richly decorated with ornaments borrowed from the lyric poets, preserves many ancient quotations. His literary descriptions of cities, paintings, or scenes of nature are valuable sources for the history of art.
