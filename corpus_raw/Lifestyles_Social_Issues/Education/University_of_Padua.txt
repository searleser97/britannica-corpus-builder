University of Padua, Italian Università Degli Studi Di Padova,  autonomous coeducational state institution of higher learning in Padua, Italy. The university was founded in 1222 by a secession of about a thousand students from the University of Bologna, reinforced by additional migrations from Bologna in 1306 and 1322. Like Bologna, it was a student-controlled university, with students electing the professors and fixing their salaries. In 1228 a number of students seceded from Padua to Vercelli, but the university survived the secession and the vicissitudes of local despotism to achieve its greatest distinction in the 15th and 16th centuries, becoming one of the two or three leading universities of Europe. Among its professors were famous Renaissance philosophers, humanists, and scientists, including Galileo.
In the Middle Ages Padua was mainly a school of civil and canon law, and its faculties of philosophy, law, theology, and medicine grew only gradually. The university’s students were originally organized into four groups according to their geographic origin. In 1399 the university was divided into two separate schools, one for the arts and medicine and one for law. The two schools were not reunited under one administration until the early 19th century.
The university’s botanical garden, founded in 1545, is the oldest in Europe. Its astronomical observatory was founded in 1761. Modern faculties include law, political science, arts and literature, philosophy, education, mathematics, physics and natural sciences, economics and commerce, statistics, pharmacy, agriculture, engineering, and medicine. The Geologic Institute contains a geological museum.
