New Lincoln School,  private experimental coeducational school in New York City enrolling students from kindergarten through grade 12. Its predecessor was founded as Lincoln School in 1917 by the Rockefeller-funded General Education Board as “a pioneer experimental school for newer educational methods,” under the aegis of Columbia University’s Teachers College. In 1941 Teachers College merged Lincoln School with Horace Mann School, which it operated as a demonstration school. When Teachers College closed down the combined school in 1946, parents of Lincoln School enrollees established the New Lincoln School in 1948 to carry on the tradition of progressive, experimental education, concentrating on the individual child, offering an interdisciplinary core program as well as electives in elementary grades, and emphasizing the arts.
