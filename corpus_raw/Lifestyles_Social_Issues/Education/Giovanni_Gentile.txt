Giovanni Gentile,  (born May 30, 1875, Castelvetrano, Italy—died  April 15, 1944, Florence), major figure in Italian idealist philosophy, politician, educator, and editor, sometimes called the “philosopher of Fascism.” His “actual idealism” shows the strong influence of G.W.F. Hegel.
After a series of university appointments, Gentile in 1917 became professor of the history of philosophy at the University of Rome. While writing La filosofia di Marx (1899; “The Philosophy of Marx”), a Hegelian examination of Karl Marx’s philosophy, he met Benedetto Croce, and from 1903 to 1922 the two men coedited the periodical La Critica. Gentile influenced Croce’s philosophy and remained his friend until 1924, when a lasting disagreement arose over Gentile’s embrace of Fascism.
As minister of education in the Fascist government of Italy from October 1922 to July 1924, Gentile carried out wide reforms. In 1925 he served as president of two commissions on constitutional reform, thus helping to lay the foundations of the Fascist corporate state. After acting as president of the Supreme Council of Public Education (1926–28) and as a member of the Fascist Grand Council (1925–29), he saw his political influence steadily decline. Perhaps his most important achievement was the Enciclopedia Italiana (first edition completed in 1936), which he began to plan in 1925 and edited until 1943. After the fall of Benito Mussolini in 1943, Gentile supported the Fascist Social Republic established by the Germans at Salò and was made the president of the Academy of Italy, in which post he served until his death at the hands of anti-Fascist communists.
Gentile’s idealist philosophy denied the existence of individual minds and of any distinction between theory and practice, subject and object, past and present. According to him, all of these categories are merely mental constructs. Mind is the Absolute, and education is the process of revelation of the Absolute.
Gentile was highly esteemed by his students, whose views he helped to publicize through Giornale critico della filosofia italiana (“Critical Journal of Italian Philosophy”).
In addition to his editions of Italian philosophers (including Giordano Bruno, Tommaso Campanella, Giambattista Vico, and Vincenzo Cuoco), Gentile wrote prolifically in education and philosophy. Among his works are Le origini della filosofia contemporanea in Italia, 4 vol. (1917–23); La riforma dell’educazione (1920; The Reform of Education); La filosofia dell’arte (1931; The Philosophy of Art); and La mia religione (1943; “My Religion”). His “actual idealism” is the subject of Teoria generale dello spirito come atto puro (1916; The Theory of Mind as Pure Act).
