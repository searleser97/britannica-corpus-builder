Union College,  private, coeducational institution of higher education located in Schenectady, New York, U.S. Comprising about 20 academic departments, it offers a curriculum in liberal arts and engineering, with an emphasis on undergraduate education. Union College cooperates with Albany Medical College and Albany Law School in joint-degree programs and is a member of a 15-school consortium that permits cross-registration. The Union campus (known as College Grounds) was designed by French architect and landscape planner Joseph Jacques Ramée in 1813. Historic landmarks include Jackson’s Gardens, which opened in the 1830s, and Nott Memorial, a 16-sided Gothic Revival building that was designed by Edward T. Potter in 1858 and completed in 1875. Enrollment is approximately 2,000.
The movement to establish a college in the region began during the American Revolution. Union College, founded in 1795, is one of the oldest nondenominational colleges in the country and the first college to receive a charter from the Regents of the State of New York. Course work went beyond the typical classical curriculum of the time and incorporated history, science, mathematics, and modern languages as well. In 1845 Union College became one of the first liberal arts colleges to offer study in engineering. The original collegiate chapters of six social fraternities were founded at Union College, including the three oldest: Kappa Alpha (founded 1825), Sigma Phi (1827), and Delta Phi (1827). Women were first admitted as students in 1970.
Distinguished graduates of Union College include U.S. President Chester A. Arthur, U.S. Secretary of State William H. Seward, secessionist Robert A. Toombs, theologian Henry James, civil engineer Squire Whipple, agriculturist Seaman Asahel Knapp, and Nobel Prize-winning physician Baruch S. Blumberg.
