University of the District of Columbia,  public, coeducational institution of higher learning in Washington, D.C., U.S. It is the only public institution of higher education in the district, and it was the first exclusively urban land-grant university. There are three campuses—the Georgia/Harvard Street campus, the Mount Vernon Square campus, and the Van Ness campus. The university consists of the University College, which all students attend until they declare their majors, and the colleges of Business and Public Management; Education and Human Ecology; Liberal and Fine Arts; Life Sciences; and Physical Science, Engineering, and Technology. The Graduate Studies Division offers master’s degree programs in business administration, urban policy, and other areas. Total enrollment is approximately 14,000.
The University of the District of Columbia had its beginnings in Miner Normal (teacher-training) School, founded as a “school for colored girls” in 1851, and in Washington Normal School, founded for white female students in 1873. Both schools became four-year teachers colleges in 1929. In 1955 the colleges merged into District of Columbia Teachers College. Federal City College and Washington Technical Institute, which had been founded in 1966 and had received land-grant status in 1968, merged with the teachers college in 1977 to form the University of the District of Columbia. The District of Columbia Water Resources Research Center and the district’s Agricultural Experiment Station are operated by the university, which also conducts research on social and economic urban problems at the Center for Applied Research and Urban Policy.
