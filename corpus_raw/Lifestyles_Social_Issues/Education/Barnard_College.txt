Barnard College,  a private liberal arts college for women in the Morningside Heights neighbourhood of New York, New York, U.S. One of the Seven Sisters schools, it was founded in 1889 by Annie Nathan Meyer in honour of Frederick Augustus Porter Barnard, then president of Columbia University.
Though Barnard partners with its across-the-street neighbour Columbia, the women’s college is a separate institution both legally and financially, with its own admissions process, curriculum, board of trustees, and endowment. Students at Barnard may take courses and participate in athletics and organizations at Columbia (and vice versa), and graduates of Barnard receive a diploma from Columbia University that is signed by the presidents of both institutions. Though Columbia began admitting women in 1983 and wanted to incorporate the women’s college into its student body, Barnard maintained its commitment to single-sex education. Its student population totals approximately 2,500.
Barnard offers bachelor’s degrees in nearly 50 areas of study, and students may earn special degrees in cooperation with Columbia, the Manhattan School of Music, the Juilliard School, the Jewish Theological Seminary, and others. Barnard is particularly well known for its dance department. Since 2000 Barnard has structured its curriculum around the Nine Ways of Knowing—nine lenses through which to learn, namely Ethics and Values, Social Analysis, Historical Studies, Cultures in Comparison, Laboratory Science, Quantitative and Deductive Reasoning, Language, Literature, and Visual and Performing Arts. Women make up approximately 65 percent of the college’s faculty.
Notable alumnae of Barnard College include Joan Rivers, Martha Stewart, Eileen Ford, Margaret Mead, Jhumpa Lahiri, Laurie Anderson, Twyla Tharp, Zora Neale Hurston, and Ntozake Shange. In 2012 U.S. Pres. Barack Obama was Barnard’s commencement speaker.
