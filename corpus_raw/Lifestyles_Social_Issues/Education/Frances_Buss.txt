Frances Buss, in full Frances Mary Buss,  (born August 16, 1827, London, England—died  December 24, 1894, London), English educator, pioneer of women’s education, and founder of the North London Collegiate School for Ladies (now North London Collegiate School for Girls).
Buss was educated in London and, from age 14, taught school with her mother. At age 18 Buss, together with her mother, opened a school in Kentish Town, London. While teaching, Buss began attending classes at Queen’s College in the evening. She had high standards for her students and believed in sound intellectual training for girls, encouraging them to take examinations. Buss founded the North London Collegiate School in 1850 in Camden Town, London. In 1864 she appeared before the Schools Enquiry Commission to testify to the need for secondary schools for girls.
With the assistance of funds from the Brewers’ and Clothworkers’ companies, she was able to open the Camden Lower School in 1871, and that same year the North London Collegiate School gained recognition as a “public” (i.e., privately endowed) school for girls. Buss supported the foundation of women’s colleges at the universities and the improvement of teachers’ training. She founded the Association of Headmistresses in 1874 and was its first president (1874–94). She was succeeded in that post by her associate Dorothea Beale (1831–1906), another pioneer in women’s education. Their widespread reputations for single-minded dedication to the cause of female education gave rise to the verse
