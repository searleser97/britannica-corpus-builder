Eastman School of Music,  conservatory of music in Rochester, N.Y., U.S. Founded in 1913, the D.K.G. School of Musical Art (so named for Messrs. Dossenbach, Klingenberg, and Gareissen, the three directors of the institute) was soon after purchased by George Eastman, who donated it to the University of Rochester with an endowment fund. The new Eastman School of Music opened in 1921. Howard Hanson, its principal director (1924–64), built it into a world-renowned institution. Eastman’s annual festival of American music (1925–71), instituted by Hanson, performed works by some 700 composers over the years, and more than a third of those programs were recorded live. Today, about 500 undergraduate and 400 graduate  students are enrolled. Eastman’s student orchestra has been considered of professional quality. The school’s faculty has included many well-known musicians, and many of its graduates have had stellar musical careers.
