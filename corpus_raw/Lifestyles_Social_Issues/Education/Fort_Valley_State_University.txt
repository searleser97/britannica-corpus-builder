Fort Valley State College was created in 1939 by the merger of Fort Valley Normal (originally High) and Industrial School and the State Teachers and Agricultural College of Forsyth. The high school had been chartered in 1895, and the State Teachers and Agricultural College, founded about 1900, initially operated out of a church in Forsyth. In 1922 the Forsyth school had been designated a state agricultural and mechanical school. In 1949, 10 years after the merger that formed Fort Valley State College, the Georgia legislature designated the college the state’s land-grant institution for blacks. The school acquired university status in 1996.
