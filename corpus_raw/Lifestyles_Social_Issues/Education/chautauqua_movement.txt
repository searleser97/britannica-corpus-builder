Chautauqua movement,  popular U.S. movement in adult education that flourished during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The original Chautauqua Lake Sunday School Assembly in western New York, founded in 1874 by John H. Vincent and Lewis Miller, began as a program for the training of Sunday-school teachers and church workers. At first entirely religious in nature, the program was gradually broadened to include general education, recreation, and popular entertainment. In later years the summer lectures and classes were supplemented by a year-round nondenominational course of directed home reading and correspondence study. William Rainey Harper, later the founding president of the University of Chicago, directed the Chautauqua educational system for several years starting in 1883.
The success of the Chautauqua, N.Y., assembly led to the founding of many similar “chautauquas” throughout the United States patterned after the original institution. By 1900 there were hundreds of “tent” chautauquas and nearly 150 independent chautauquas with permanent lecture halls, many of which continued the tradition of the lyceum movement. Although the remote chautauquas began to decline after their peak year in 1924, the original institution at Chautauqua remained in existence, offering a diversified program that included symphony concerts, operas, plays, university summer school courses, and lectures.
