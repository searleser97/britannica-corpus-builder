Maternal school, French École Maternelle,  a French school for children between two and six years old. Private schools for young children were founded in France around 1779, under the influence of Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s Émile. The central government took over most of them in 1833 and named them maternal schools, hoping that the care would be like that of a mother. Pauline Kergomard, general inspector of schools from 1879 to 1917, abolished fees in 1881. In 1886 she issued guidelines advocating that children should be offered challenging toys and games and allowed to move about. By 1911 every French child had access to either a specially housed maternal school or to an infants school in a primary-school building, and about 60 percent attended such a school or a similar private school.
Maternal schools are voluntary and are open six days a week for many hours each day. Most private maternal schools charge no fees and adhere closely to government guidelines in return for generous subsidies. Children are supervised in games, exercises, and other recreational activities and are given rudimentary instruction in speaking, singing, drawing, general knowledge, and basic ethics. Efforts are made to improve perception and language skills, to broaden experience, and to instill moral sensitivity. Researchers have found that maternal schools help poor children greatly with exercise and nutrition but are hampered in raising intellectual skills, because of a high pupil-teacher ratio.
