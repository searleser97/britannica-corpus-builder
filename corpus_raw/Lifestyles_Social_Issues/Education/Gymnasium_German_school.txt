Gymnasium,   in Germany, state-maintained secondary school that prepares pupils for higher academic education. This type of nine-year school originated in Strassburg in 1537. Although the usual leaving age is 19 or 20, a pupil may terminate his studies at the age of 16 and enter a vocational school. In Germany the Gymnasium is differentiated into three main types, according to curriculum: classical, which includes Latin, Greek, and one modern language; modern (Realgymnasium), with Latin and two modern languages; and mathematical and scientific (Oberschule), with two modern languages and optional Latin. Senior departments of elementary schools, middle schools (Mittelschulen), and teachers’ training, commercial, and senior girls’ colleges also provide general secondary or postprimary education.
