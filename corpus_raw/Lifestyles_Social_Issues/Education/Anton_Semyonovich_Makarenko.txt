Anton Makarenko, in full Anton Semyonovich Makarenko,  (born March 1 [March 13, New Style], 1888, Belopolye, Ukraine, Russian Empire [now Bilopillya, Ukraine]—died April 1, 1939, Moscow, Russia, U.S.S.R.), teacher and social worker who was the most-influential educational theorist in the Soviet Union.
Makarenko studied at the Poltava Pedagogical Institute and graduated in 1917 with honours. In the 1920s he organized the Gorky Colony, a rehabilitation settlement for children who had been made homeless by the Russian Revolution and who roamed the countryside in criminal gangs. In 1931 he was appointed head of the Dzerzhinsky Commune, a penal institution for young offenders.
Makarenko wrote several books on education. His most-popular work, Pedagogicheskaya poema (1933–35; “Pedagogical Poem”; Eng. trans. The Road to Life; or, Epic of Education), recounts his educational work at Gorky Colony. Kniga dlya roditeley (1937; A Book for Parents) and Flagi na bashnyakh (1939; “Flags on the Battlements”; Eng. trans. Learning to Live) explore the theory of collective education. Makarenko regarded work as basic to intellectual and moral development: all children should be assigned tasks requiring labour and should be given positions of responsibility in order to learn the limitations of their individual rights and privileges. Thus, his first principle of socialist upbringing was: “The maximum possible demands with the maximum possible respect.”
