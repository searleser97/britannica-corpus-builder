Sarah Pierce,  (born June 26, 1767, Litchfield, Connecticut [U.S.]—died January 19, 1852, Litchfield), American educator, noted for the school that she developed from a small group of pupils studying in her home into one of the first major U.S. institutions for women, Litchfield Female Academy.
The school Pierce opened in her home in 1792 was so successful that in 1798 a group of Litchfield citizens presented her with a building to house the rapidly growing institution. Alongside Tapping Reeve’s already famous Litchfield Law School, Pierce’s school helped make Litchfield a leading centre of education in the United States.
In addition to basic subjects, Pierce taught composition, geography, history, needlework, painting, and dance. She also saw to it that her charges received physical exercise. In 1814 she took her nephew, John P. Brace, a Williams College graduate, into the school, and he instituted classes in logic, philosophy, and the sciences. In 1825 she relinquished the principalship to him, but she continued to teach the course that was her particular love, universal history. Her interest prompted her to compile four volumes of history, which were published between 1811 and 1818 under the title Sketches of Universal History Compiled from Several Authors, for the Use of Schools.
At its peak the school enrolled some 130 students, some of them boys. Among them were Catharine Beecher, Harriet Beecher (Stowe), and Henry Ward Beecher, children of the Reverend Lyman Beecher, who provided religious instruction at the school in return for his children’s tuition. In 1827 the school was incorporated as the Litchfield Female Academy. Pierce retired from teaching in 1833, and the school closed about a decade later.
