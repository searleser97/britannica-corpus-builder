Mary Salome Cutler Fairchild, née Mary Salome Cutler,  (born June 21, 1855, Dalton, Mass., U.S.—died Dec. 20, 1921, Takoma Park, Md.),  American librarian, a central figure in the establishment and teaching of the field of library science in the United States.
Salome Cutler graduated from Mount Holyoke Female Seminary (now Mount Holyoke College) in South Hadley, Massachusetts, in 1875 and taught there from 1876 to 1878. After a period of ill health, she became interested in the relatively new field of librarianship. After cataloging a small country library in 1884, she sought the assistance of Melvil Dewey, the librarian of Columbia College in New York City, in finding a library-related position. Dewey hired her as a cataloger in the Columbia library, and in January 1887, when he opened his pioneering School of Library Economy, the first U.S. institution for training librarians, Cutler became an instructor in cataloging. In 1889 she was named head cataloger of the Columbia library, but shortly afterward she went with Dewey and the school to Albany, New York.
Cutler became vice director of what was reorganized as the New York State Library School and, with Dewey deeply involved in other work, was its chief administrator and guiding spirit for the 16 years of her association with it. Under her direction a strong curriculum was made stronger, entrance requirements included a difficult examination and, from 1902, a bachelor’s degree, and the scope of library training was broadened to meet her ideal of the librarian as a professional educator in the public service. From 1889 she also served as librarian of the New York State Library for the Blind in Albany. In 1891 the University of the State of New York awarded her a bachelor’s degree in library science. From 1892 to 1898 (and again from 1909 to 1914) she was a member of the council of the American Library Association, and in 1893 she chaired a committee of the association that established a 5,000-volume model library and compiled a catalog for it at the World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago. In 1894–95 and again in 1900–01 she was vice president of the association. In 1897 she married Edwin M. Fairchild.
In 1905, following closely upon Dewey’s rancorous resignation, Fairchild fell ill and was forced to retire from her position with the library school and the library for the blind. Her professional activities were limited thereafter. She was a frequent contributor of articles to professional journals.
