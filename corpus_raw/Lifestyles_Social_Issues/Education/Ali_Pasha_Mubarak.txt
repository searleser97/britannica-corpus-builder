ʿAlī Pasha Mubārak,  (born c. 1823, Birinbāl, Egypt—died  Nov. 14, 1893, Cairo), administrator and author, who was responsible for the creation and modernization of a unified system of education in Egypt.
A product of the military schools created by Muḥammad ʿAlī Pasha (ruled 1805–48), Mubārak was sent in 1844 to France to complete his education, and on his return in 1849/50 was appointed to the ministry of war. Shortly afterward he became the head of the military training college at Mafruza. During the reign of Muḥammad Saʿīd (ruled 1854–63) he found himself out of favour and was dismissed from office.
With the accession of Ismāʿīl Pasha (ruled 1863–79), Mubārak joined the government as a member of the Public Works Commission and worked, among other projects, on a scheme for the beautification of Cairo. In his next post as assistant director of education (1867) he separated the military schools from the government-operated civilian schools. In 1870 he created the Dār al-ʿulūm (“The Abode of Learning”), a teacher training college modelled on the French École Normale Supérieure. He also improved conditions in the village schools, changed the curriculum of the traditional religious schools to emphasize foreign languages and science, and encouraged the translation, publication, and adaptation of technical textbooks. After serving another five years as minister for public works, he became minister of education (1888–91) and succeeded in unifying Egypt’s system of education, integrating all military, secular, and religious schools under the responsibility of the minister of education.
Mubārak’s most famous work was Khiṭāṭ at-tawfīqīyah al-jadīdah, 20 vol. (1886), an encyclopaedia which dealt with all aspects of Egyptian culture and history.
