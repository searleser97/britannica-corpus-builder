Winnetka Plan,   widely imitated educational experiment in individualized ungraded learning, developed in 1919 under the leadership of Carleton Washburne in the elementary school system of Winnetka, Ill., U.S. The Winnetka Plan grew out of the reaction of many educators to the uniform grading system that held all children to the same rate of progress. Children participating in the Winnetka Plan might be working in several grades at once. The curriculum was set up in two sections: the common essentials, which was grade work divided into specific tasks to be learned by each child individually; and creative activities, which included art, literature, music appreciation, crafts, drama, and physical activities. In the common-essentials section of grade work, a pupil could move on as soon as the material had been mastered. The second section had no achievement standards: each pupil did as much or as little as he wished.
