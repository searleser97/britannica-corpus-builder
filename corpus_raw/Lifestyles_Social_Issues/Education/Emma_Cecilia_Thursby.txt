Emma Cecilia Thursby,  (born Feb. 21, 1845, Williamsburg [now in Brooklyn], N.Y., U.S.—died July 4, 1931, New York, N.Y.), American singer and educator who enjoyed a popular concert career in both Europe and the United States in the 1870s and ’80s.
Thursby began singing in church at the age of five. Her musical training began at the Bethlehem (Pennsylvania) Female Seminary (now Moravian College) in 1857. In 1859 her schooling ended when her father died, and the family’s financial difficulties required her to give private music lessons. She continued her own vocal studies with a number of instructors and frequently sang in church choirs in Brooklyn and Boston.
A concert performance with Patrick S. Gilmore’s 22nd Regiment Band at the Philadelphia Academy of Music in 1874 began Thursby’s rise to national and international acclaim. She made a tour of several cities with Gilmore. A year later she appeared in a joint concert with Hans von Bülow at New York’s Chickering Hall, and she toured California and appeared on the Redpath Lyceum circuit with Mark Twain in 1876. She soon gave up church singing in favour of the concert stage. Under the management of Maurice Strakosch she made a concert tour of the United States and Canada in 1877–78, and in May 1878 she made her London debut. After an American tour in 1879–80, Thursby made a tour of Germany. In 1881 she was awarded the medal of the Société des Concerts of the Paris Conservatory. Her European following was large and enthusiastic, attracted by a voice of bell-like clarity, flexibility, and remarkable range.
After 1884 she appeared infrequently, and her last major performance occurred in Chicago in December 1895. She devoted herself thereafter to teaching, from 1905 to 1911 as professor of music at the Institute of Musical Art in New York City. Among her pupils was American soprano Geraldine Farrar.
