Edward Thring,  (born November 29, 1821, Alford, Somerset, England—died October 22, 1887, Uppingham, Rutland), schoolmaster whose reorganization of Uppingham School influenced public school education throughout England.
Educated at Eton and King’s College, Cambridge, Thring was ordained in 1846. Seven years later he was appointed headmaster of Uppingham (founded 1584). He transformed it from a small country grammar school into a large and important public school. At Uppingham, Thring opened (1859) the first school gymnasium in England, introduced wood and metal workshops, and provided a swimming pool. In academic matters he stressed sound training in mathematics, the classics, and music. In 1869 he founded the Headmasters’ Conference, an organization that had a great influence in English public school education. His major work, Theory and Practice of Teaching (1883), offered critical advice on teaching and teacher education.
