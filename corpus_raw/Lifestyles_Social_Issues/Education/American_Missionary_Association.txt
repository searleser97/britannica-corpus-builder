American Missionary Association (AMA),  nondenominational society that worked to develop educational opportunities for blacks and other minorities in the United States. The society originally grew out of a committee organized in 1839 to defend a group of African slaves who had mutinied against their Spanish owners and had brought their slave ship (Amistad) into U.S. waters to seek protection there. The AMA itself was incorporated in 1846 by the merger of three missionary antislavery societies whose goal was to establish missions for freed slaves overseas. After 1850 the AMA turned primarily to abolitionist activities. When the Union armies began freeing slaves during the American Civil War, the AMA opened schools and churches for them. The AMA founded more than 500 schools for freed slaves in the South in the decades following the Civil War. These schools were actually open to all students and often operated as integrated institutions during the Reconstruction period.
As the South recovered from the effects of the war and developed public school systems, the AMA turned over its elementary and secondary schools to the public systems and instead concentrated on improving and expanding colleges for blacks in the South. The AMA founded nine predominantly black colleges: Atlanta University, Dillard University, Fisk University, Hampton Institute (now Hampton University), Howard University, Huston-Tillotson College, LeMoyne College (now LeMoyne-Owen College), Talladega College, and Tougaloo College; it was also instrumental in founding the racially integrated Berea College. The AMA ceased operations as an independent body in the mid-20th century, and its papers and other collections became part of the Amistad Research Center at Tulane University.
