Alternative education,  Education that diverges in some way from that offered by conventional schools. Examples may be found in publicly funded schools, private schools, and homeschooling curricula. The focus might be on alternative structures (e.g., open classrooms), alternative subject matter (e.g., religious instruction), or alternative relationships (e.g., more informal relations between students and teachers or between students of different ages). Each of these approaches aims to supply what is seen to be lacking in conventional education, whether moral or ethical principles or recognition of childrenâ€™s individual learning styles and innate creativity.
