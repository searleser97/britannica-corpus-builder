University of Geneva,  Institution of higher learning in Geneva, Switzerland. It was founded by John Calvin and Théodor de Bèze (1519–1605) in 1559 as Schola Genevensis (later called the Academy), a theological seminary. The natural sciences, law, and philosophy were later added to the curriculum, and in the 19th century a medical faculty was established. In the 1930s the Institut Jean-Jacques Rousseau, a private school of education founded in 1912, became part of the university. Many foreign students are attracted by its strong reputation in international studies, botany, and education.
