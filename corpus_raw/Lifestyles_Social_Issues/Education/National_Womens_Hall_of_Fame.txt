National Women’s Hall of Fame,  not-for-profit educational institution founded in 1969 to honour the accomplishments of outstanding American women. The Hall of Fame is located in Seneca Falls, New York, the site of the first Women’s Rights Convention, in 1848. It contains information and exhibits about each of its inductees and also sponsors traveling exhibits, poster and essay contests, and other educational events relating to American women’s achievements. 
As of 1999 more than 150 American women had been elected to the National Women’s Hall of Fame in acknowledgment and remembrance of their achievements as artists, athletes, educators, humanitarians, legislators, philanthropists, and scientists. New inductees are selected annually on the basis of the value of their contributions to society and their fields and the enduring merit of their accomplishments.
