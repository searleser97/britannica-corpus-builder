Hiram College was founded by Christian Church members in 1850 as Western Reserve Eclectic Institute. James A. Garfield, 20th U.S. president, was a student, English teacher, and, in 1857–60, principal of the institute. The school became Hiram College in 1867. In 1934 it pioneered a single-course plan, in which a student studied each subject exclusively for nine weeks. In 1977 Weekend College, for adult students, was initiated. Poet Vachel Lindsay attended Hiram College.
