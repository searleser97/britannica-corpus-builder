Nakamura Utaemon,  notable line of actors in the kabuki theatre of Japan.
Nakamura Utaemon I (b. 1714—d. Nov. 23, 1791, Ōsaka, Japan) became well known for his performance of villains’ roles. His student Utaemon II (who, as is customary in Japanese tradition, assumed the name as well as the role of his master) later discarded that name, but Utaemon I’s son (b. March 31, 1778—d. Sept. 12, 1838, Ōsaka) assumed the name Utaemon III a few years after his father’s death. An extremely versatile player who was a talented dancer and who could brilliantly perform the entire spectrum of male and onnagata (female impersonator) roles, Utaemon III became one of the most famous kabuki actors of his day. His student and successor, Utaemon IV (b. 1798, Edo [now Tokyo]—d. March 8, 1852, Ōsaka), also showed remarkable versatility and was well known in his time.
Utaemon V (b. Feb. 12, 1866, Edo—d. Sept. 12, 1940, Tokyo) became a leading actor in onnagata roles during the Meiji period and worked to ensure the artistic continuity of the kabuki theatre, which was threatened during that period of intense westernization. He also performed in the innovative plays of dramatist and scholar Isubouchi Shōyō, which incorporated Western theatrical elements. Utaemon V eventually became the dean of all kabuki actors of his time. His son, Utaemon VI (b. Jan. 20, 1917, Tokyo), became a leading performer of onnagata roles in the mid-20th century. He tried to preserve the classical style in the kabuki theatre, and to this end he encouraged the novelist Mishima Yukio and others to write new kabuki plays in a style that conformed to traditional practices. Utaemon VI also helped revive old kabuki plays that were seldom performed. He was designated a Living National Treasure by the Japanese government.
