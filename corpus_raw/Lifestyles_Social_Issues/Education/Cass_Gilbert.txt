Cass Gilbert,  (born November 24, 1859, Zanesville, Ohio, U.S.—died May 17, 1934, Brockenhurst, Hampshire, England), architect, designer of the Woolworth Building (1908–13) in New York City and of the United States Supreme Court Building (completed 1935) in Washington, D.C. Conscientious and prosperous, he was an acknowledged leader of the architectural profession in the United States during a period in which monumental architecture predominated.
After attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for one year, Gilbert worked briefly as a draftsman for the noted New York City architectural firm of McKim, Mead, and White. In 1882 he entered a partnership in St. Paul, Minnesota. Having attracted national attention by his design for the Minnesota state capitol, St. Paul (built 1896–1903), he moved to New York City. In addition to the Woolworth Building, his major works in New York included the U.S. customhouse (1899–1905; in a Renaissance style with Germanic detail) and the federal courthouse (completed 1936). For some years the 60-story (792-foot) Woolworth skyscraper, with its lacy Gothic detail in terra-cotta over a steel frame, was regarded as a model of tall commercial building design and is still a favourite with the public.
In Washington, D.C., Gilbert built the U.S. Treasury Annex (1918–19), as well as the Supreme Court Building, the monumentality of which is sometimes felt to be oppressive. He also planned the campuses of the Universities of Minnesota (Minneapolis) and Texas (Austin).
