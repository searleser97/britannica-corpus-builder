Sālimīyah,   school of Muslim theologians founded by the Muslim scholar and mystic Sahl at-Tustarī (d. ad 896). The school was named after one of his disciples, Muḥammad ibn Sālim (d. ad 909). Even though the Sālimīyah were not a Ṣūfī (mystic) group in the strict sense of the word, they utilized many Ṣūfī terms and ideas in their doctrines.
The Sālimīyah spoke of God’s tajallī (appearance) on the day of judgment in human form for all his creatures to see. When this happens, God’s light will overwhelm the scene, and salvation will be granted to everyone and everything. They held also that ittiḥād (mystical union) with God can be achieved through man’s contemplation of his own personality until he achieves complete consciousness of it. They based this view on the well-known concept that God created man after his image. Consequently, the Sālimīyah maintained that every man has an element of divinity that he must try to realize through constant contemplation.
