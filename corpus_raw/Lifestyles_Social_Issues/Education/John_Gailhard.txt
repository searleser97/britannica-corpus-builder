John Gailhard,  also called Jean Gailhard,  (flourished  17th century), English author of an educational treatise on proper training for the English nobility that is noteworthy for its insights into the educational goals and techniques of the 17th-century English upper classes. Gailhard seems to have spent a number of years as tutor abroad to “several of the nobility and gentry,” but nothing is really known of his life.
In his Compleat Gentleman (1678), Gailhard supported a broad curriculum, with the emphasis to be placed on education to develop character and noble bearing. In the second part of his two-part book, Gailhard detailed the educational advantages of foreign travel and prescribed a tutorial program for use abroad. He recommended prior knowledge of the native language, the keeping of a diary, regular religious devotions and Bible reading, physical exercise, and music. He suggested a three-year grand tour including stops at specific schools to learn the general principles of medicine and law.
