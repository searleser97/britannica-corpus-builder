Black Alliance for Educational Options (BAEO),  organization launched in 2000 to advocate for initiatives including private school vouchers, charter schools, tuition tax credits, and public school choice and to build support for those initiatives among African Americans.
The groundwork for the Black Alliance for Educational Options (BAEO) was laid at Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1999 during a symposium convened by Howard Fuller, a former Milwaukee Public Schools superintendent. An organizational meeting to set up the BAEO was held in Washington, D.C., at the end of 1999 and was followed by a second meeting during which participants elected Fuller the first chairman of the board. Kaleem Caire became the BAEOâ€™s first president when it officially launched in 2000.
In 2002 the BAEO received an initial grant from the U.S. Department of Education to develop Project Clarion, a public information campaign to inform parents of their available options under the federal No Child Left Behind Act of 2001; another federal grant followed in 2004. The BAEO also received a $4 million grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to oversee the opening of small project-based high schools in low-income urban African American communities.
 The BAEO has been criticized by organizations such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the National Alliance of Black School Educators, which argue that the BAEO has disguised efforts to privatize the public school system as advocacy for African American students.
