Eleven-plus,   in England, competitive examination given between primary and secondary school at about age 11. It evolved after 1944 as a means of determining in which of the three types of secondary school—grammar, technical, or modern—a child should continue his education. Originally the eleven-plus excluded unsuccessful contenders from grammar school, which would prepare them for university entrance. After the emergence in some areas of unselective comprehensive schools during the 1950s and ’60s, the importance of the eleven-plus in determining who could eventually enter universities declined. Provision was also made for pupils to transfer from secondary modern to grammar schools at the age of 13, if their progress merited such a change, or to take a further two-year course in preparation for the university matriculation examinations.
The eleven-plus has been sharply criticized for determining at age 11 a child’s scholastic future, a decisive factor in his vocational prospects. It also has been charged with replacing the social barrier of fee paying with one that tends to create an educational elite. Others counter, however, that the practice of streaming in the comprehensive schools has a similar elitist tendency. The most damaging criticism of the eleven-plus emerged after surveys were conducted that demonstrated that it was inefficient and placed a large proportion of students in the wrong type of school.
