Helen Magill White, née Helen Magill,  (born November 28, 1853, Providence, Rhode Island, U.S.—died October 28, 1944, Kittery Point, Maine), educator who was the first woman in the United States to earn a Ph.D. degree.
Helen Magill grew up in a Quaker family that valued education for both women and men. In 1859 the family moved to Boston, where Helen enrolled as the only female student in the Boston Public Latin School, of which her father was a submaster. In 1873 she was a member of the first class to graduate from Swarthmore College, of which her father was then president. She continued studies in the classics at Swarthmore and then at Boston University, where her dissertation on Greek drama in 1877 earned her a Ph.D. From 1877 to 1881 she studied in England at the University of Cambridge, placing third in her tripos (honours examinations) at Newnham College in the latter year.
After a year as principal of a private school in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, Magill was selected in 1883 to organize Howard Collegiate Institute in West Bridgewater, Massachusetts. She remained director of Howard until 1887, when she resigned in a dispute with the trustees. She then taught briefly at Evelyn College, a short-lived women’s annex to Princeton University. Illness clouded the next few years, during which she taught high school for a time. In September 1890 she married Andrew D. White, the retired president of Cornell University and a college classmate of her father’s, whom she had first met in 1887. White accompanied her husband to his diplomatic posts in St. Petersburg (1892–94) and Berlin (1897–1903). She took no part in public or educational affairs thereafter except, in 1913, to publicly oppose woman suffrage.
