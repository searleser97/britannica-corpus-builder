Henry Peacham,  (born c. 1576, North Mimms, Hertfordshire, England—died c. 1643), English author best known for his The Compleat Gentleman (1622), important in the tradition of courtesy books. Numerous in the late Renaissance, courtesy books dealt with the education, ideals, and conduct befitting a gentleman or lady of the court.
Peacham was educated at the University of Cambridge and was successively a schoolmaster, a traveling tutor, and an author. Of his time as master of the free school at Wymondham, Norfolk, he wrote, “Whiles that it was free, Myselfe, the Maister, lost my libertie.” He wrote on a variety of themes and also published some of his pen-and-ink drawings, but his chief work remained The Compleat Gentleman. It was a full expression of his theories on education, and its table of contents exhibits the wide range of his interests: cosmography, geometry, poetry, music, sculpture, drawing, painting, and heraldry. Samuel Johnson drew the heraldic definitions for his Dictionary from the 1661 edition.
