Moses Coit Tyler,  (born Aug. 2, 1835, Griswold, Conn., U.S.—died  Dec. 28, 1900, Ithaca, N.Y.), U.S. literary historian whose use of literary documents in the history of pre-Revolutionary American ideas was a major contribution to U.S. historiography.
The descendant of an old New England family, Tyler was taken west in 1837 by his parents, who eventually settled in Detroit in 1842. In 1852 he entered the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, transferring a year later to Yale University. After graduating, he attended both Yale and Andover Theological seminaries. He served as a pastor in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., from 1860 to 1862, when, in disillusionment, he abandoned the ministry. The following year he travelled to England, where he lectured, wrote, and helped to found the London School of Physical Education. Returning to the United States, he became in 1867 the sole professor of English literature at the University of Michigan, working throughout the next five years to improve teaching methods and curricula for literature courses. In 1873 he left Michigan for New York to become literary editor of The Christian Union, a politically liberal and reformist religious weekly. The same year he wrote Manual of English Literature in England. Unhappy in the field of journalism, he returned to the University of Michigan in 1874, creating the first course on American literature and working on his projected History of American Literature, 1607–1765, 2 vol. (1878). The work was well received by scholars, particularly because of its stress on basically historical and sociopolitical documents.
In 1881 Tyler was given the newly created chair of American history at Cornell University, Ithaca, N.Y. He was active in founding the American Historical Association in 1884 and published a biography of the U.S. patriot and orator Patrick Henry in 1886. After studying the language and university system of Germany in 1888, he began the next year the monumental Literary History of the American Revolution, 2 vol. (1897). A trailblazing intellectual history of the period between 1763 and 1783, it concentrated on essayists, pamphleteers, and satirists, thus broadening the scope of historical research. In part influenced by the German school of cultural history, the history was the product of a full and scholarly use of the primary sources of the period. Jessica Tyler Austen’s Moses Coit Tyler (1911) and Howard M. Jones’s Life of Moses Coit Tyler (1933) are excellent biographies.
