Amherst College,  private, independent liberal-arts college for men and women in Amherst, Massachusetts, U.S., established in 1821 and chartered in 1825. The lexicographer Noah Webster was one of the founders of the college, which was originally intended to train indigent men for the ministry. It offers flexible programs of study in which students complete two years of courses in the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences, after which they take seminars; they may also spend their third or fourth year doing independent research. Amherst is a member of the Five Colleges consortium, which also includes Hampshire, Mount Holyoke, and Smith colleges and the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. Originally a menâ€™s college, Amherst admitted women as transfer students in 1975 and as first-year students beginning in 1976. Campus facilities include the Robert Frost Library, the Mead Art Museum, the Kirby Theatre, and the Pratt Museum of Natural History. The college administers the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C., named for Amherst alumnus Henry Clay Folger. Total enrollment is about 1,600.
