Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Hebrew Ha-universiṭa Ha-ʿivrit Bi-yerushalayim,  state-subsidized institution of higher learning in Jerusalem. The foremost university in Israel, it attracts many Jewish students from abroad. Originally inaugurated (1925) on Mount Scopus, it was transferred to Givʿat Ram in the Israeli-controlled sector of Jerusalem after 1948, when Mount Scopus became a demilitarized Israeli area within Jordanian territory. After the Israeli reoccupation of Mount Scopus in 1967, the university used both campuses, and Arab students began attending. It has faculties of humanities, science, social sciences, law, agriculture, dental medicine, and medicine, and schools of education, social work, pharmacy, home economics, and applied science and technology and a graduate library school.
