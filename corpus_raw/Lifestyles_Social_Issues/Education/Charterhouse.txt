Charterhouse,   a well-known school and charitable foundation that is now in Godalming, Surrey, Eng. The name Charterhouse is a corruption of the French Chartreuse (the location of the first Carthusian monastery). The name is found in various places in England—e.g., Charterhouse in the Mendip Hills, near Cheddar, and, notably the London Charterhouse in the City of London, near Aldersgate—where religious houses of the Carthusian Order had been established in the Middle Ages. After the London Charterhouse was dissolved in 1535, the property changed hands several times until, in 1671, the owner endowed a hospital on the site and bequeathed money for a chapel, hospital (almshouse), and school. Charterhouse school provided an education for poor but scholarly youths. The school was removed in 1872 to Godalming in Surrey. Famous pupils of Charterhouse school include Roger Williams, founder of Rhode Island (U.S.); the literary critic Joseph Addison; Sir Richard Steele; John Wesley; Sir William Blackstone; William Makepeace Thackeray; and Robert Baden-Powell, founder of the Boy Scout movement.
