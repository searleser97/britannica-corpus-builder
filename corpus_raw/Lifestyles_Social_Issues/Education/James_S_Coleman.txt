James S. Coleman, in full James Samuel Coleman,  (born May 12, 1926, Bedford, Indiana, U.S.—died March 25, 1995, Chicago, Illinois), American sociologist, a pioneer in mathematical sociology whose studies strongly influenced education policy in the United States.
Coleman received a B.S. from Purdue University (1949) and a Ph.D. from Columbia University (1955), where he was a research associate in the Bureau of Applied Social Research (1953–55). While there he was influenced by the style and ability of Paul Lazarsfeld to stimulate creative problem solving, an influence demonstrated in two major works: Introduction to Mathematical Sociology (1964) and Mathematics of Collective Action (1973).
Coleman was a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study of Behavioral Science in Palo Alto, California (1955–56), and then served as assistant professor of sociology at the University of Chicago (1956–59). He was an associate and then a full professor in the department of social relations at Johns Hopkins University from 1959 to 1973 and then returned to Chicago as professor and senior study director at the National Opinion Research Center, which is the University of Chicago’s counterpart to the Bureau of Applied Social Research at Columbia University.
Coleman’s work had a far-reaching impact on government education policy and sparked repeated controversy. In 1966 Coleman presented a report to the U.S. Congress in which he concluded that poor black children did better academically in integrated middle-class schools. His findings provided the sociological underpinnings for the widespread busing of students to achieve racial balance in schools, a practice that met with strong resistance from parents in many areas. In 1975 Coleman rescinded his support of busing, concluding that it had encouraged the deterioration of public schools by encouraging white flight to avoid integration. In 1981 Coleman published a study of 75,000 high school students that stated that private and Catholic schools, with more emphasis on discipline and with higher expectations of performance, provided an education superior to that of public schools.
Coleman’s writings include Union Democracy (1956; with Seymour Lipset); The Adolescent Society (1961); Adolescents and the Schools (1965; with others); Youth: Transition to Adulthood (1973); Models of Change and Response Uncertainty (1964), which is concerned with community themes; Resources for Social Change (1971); Power and Structure of Society (1973); Equality of Educational Opportunity (1966; with others); Longitudinal Data Analysis (1981); The Asymmetric Society (1982); High School Achievement (1982; with others); and the work he considered his most important contribution to sociology, Foundations of Social Theory (1990), an examination of the formation and behaviour of communities.
