Dominican University, formerly Rosary College,  private, coeducational university in the Chicago suburb River Forest, Illinois, U.S. It is affiliated with the Sinsinawa Dominican Sisters, a religious order of the Roman Catholic Church. The school was initially founded in 1848 in Wisconsin as St. Clara Academy, a frontier school for women, by a Dominican educator who rejected the course of study conventionally offered to young women during the period and instead included sciences, history, and philosophy in the school’s curriculum. The academy’s staff were the Sinsinawa Dominican Sisters, who established St. Clara’s College in Sinsinawa, Wisconsin, in 1901. At the request of Archbishop George William Mundelein of Chicago, the college moved to River Forest (10 miles [16 km] west of Chicago) in 1922 and was renamed Rosary College. The library-science school opened in 1930 and was then the only Rosary program that accepted men. In 1970 the college adopted a coeducational policy. In 1997 the school was renamed Dominican University. Total enrollment exceeds 2,500.
Dominican University offers a range of undergraduate majors in business, education, and arts and sciences. Master’s degree programs in business, education, and library and information science are also available. Students enjoy access to facilities at Argonne National Laboratory, the Shedd Aquarium, and the Morton Arboretum.
