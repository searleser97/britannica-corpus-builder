Danshaku Motoda Nagazane, also called Motoda Eifu,  (born Oct. 30, 1818, Kumamoto, Japan—died  Jan. 21, 1891, Tokyo), imperial tutor responsible for the conservative tone of the Japanese Imperial Rescript on Education (Oct. 30, 1890). Placed in every school throughout Japan until 1945, it started the trend toward political indoctrination of the nation’s young people.
Motoda was a Confucian instructor who joined the imperial household in 1870. He became imperial tutor, a court councillor, and in 1877 privy councillor to the emperor Meiji (reigned 1868–1912), whom he greatly influenced. He insisted on the Confucian tone of the rescript, emphasizing filial piety, social harmony, and loyalty to the emperor.
