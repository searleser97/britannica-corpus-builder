University of Milan, Italian Universit√† Degli Studi Di Milano,  coeducational state institution of higher learning in Milan founded in 1924 by Luigi Mangiagalli as the Royal University of Milan. Two existing scientific institutions, the Royal Scientific and Literary Academy (founded under the Casati Law of 1859) and the Clinical Institutes (1906), formed the foundation of the new university. By 1934, 60 different scientific institutes, clinics, and schools of advanced study had been established within the university, including a school whose graduates were sent to practice in rural districts. Brought under state control by the Fascists, the university remains under government jurisdiction but enjoys administrative autonomy. In the decade following 1969, when admission requirements to Italian universities were relaxed, student enrollment at Milan rose from about 11,000 to more than 60,000. A laurea, or degree, is offered in 19 disciplines requiring four to six years of study.
