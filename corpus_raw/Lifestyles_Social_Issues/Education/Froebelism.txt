Froebelism,  pedagogic system of German educator Friedrich Froebel (1782–1852), founder of the kindergarten in 1837. Froebel’s methods, based on Johann Pestalozzi’s ideas, were rooted in the premise that man is essentially active and creative rather than merely receptive. His belief in self-activity and play in child education resulted in the introduction of a series of toys, or learning apparatuses, devised to stimulate learning through well-directed play accompanied by songs and music. The toys, which he called gifts, consisted of six sets, or groups, arranged in ascending order of complexity, beginning with coloured worsted balls and progressing to such objects as blocks, squares, and cubes. These objects provided a series of exercises in useful, artistic, and geometric constructions and lessons in numbers for preschool children.
