Horace Mann School,  private elementary and secondary school in New York, New York, U.S. It was founded in 1887 as a coeducational experimental school by the Teachers College of Columbia University to test progressive educational theories under the observation of Teachers College students. It acquired its name (for the 19th-century American educator Horace Mann) in the early 1890s. In 1914 the boys’ division of the school moved to the Riverdale section of the Bronx, where it became a pioneer in the country day school movement, but the girls’ division remained in the same location. In 1940 Teachers College took over the Lincoln School, an experimental school previously operated by the Rockefeller-funded General Education Board, and merged it with the girls’ division of Horace Mann. Teachers College discontinued the combined school in 1946, after which the elementary and girls’ divisions closed down and the boys’ division continued under a separate charter. Horace Mann absorbed the New York School for Nursery Years in 1968 and the Barnard Elementary School in 1972; in 1975 the high school again became coeducational. The school also operates the John Dorr Nature Laboratory in Washington, Connecticut.
