Lucy Wheelock,  (born Feb. 1, 1857, Cambridge, Vt., U.S.—died Oct. 2, 1946, Boston, Mass.),  American educator who was an important figure in the developmental years of the kindergarten movement in the United States.
Wheelock graduated from high school in 1874 and taught for two years in her native village. In 1876 she enrolled in the Chauncy Hall School in Boston to prepare for college, but her discovery of the school’s kindergarten altered her plans. On the advice of Elizabeth Peabody she entered the Kindergarten Training School in Boston in 1878, and on receiving her diploma in 1879 she became a kindergarten teacher at Chauncy Hall.
In 1888, following the introduction of kindergartens into the Boston public school system, Wheelock instituted a one-year training course for teachers at Chauncy Hall. The course proved a remarkable success, and in 1893 it was lengthened to two years. In 1896 Wheelock left the Chauncy Hall School to form the independent Wheelock Kindergarten Training School. The training of teachers for primary grades was begun in 1899, and training of nursery school teachers began in 1926. In 1929 the kindergarten course was further lengthened to three years. Students were given training in fundamental Froebelian methods and in various innovative additions to kindergarten pedagogy. They also were taught to consider the kindergarten classroom as only one element in a larger process of socialization that they should direct.
In the kindergarten movement Wheelock occupied a mediating position between the orthodox Froebelians led by Susan Blow and the progressive innovators led by Patty Smith Hill. From 1905 to 1909 she chaired the Committee of Nineteen appointed to study the areas of disagreement in kindergarten methodology, and she edited the committee’s report, The Kindergarten, in 1913.
Wheelock served on the committee on education of the National Congress of Mothers (later the National Congress of Parents and Teachers) from 1899 and was its head from 1908. She also was active in community work in Boston, establishing free kindergartens in various poor neighbourhoods and contributing to the work of settlement houses and other organizations.
Among Wheelock’s published works are Red-Letter Stories (1884) and Swiss Stories for Children (1887), both translated from the writings of Johanna Spyri, and Talks to Mothers (1920; with Elizabeth Colson); she edited Pioneers of the Kindergarten in America (1923), Kindergarten Children’s Hour (1924; five volumes), and The Kindergarten in New England (1935). In 1929 she was appointed to the education committee of the League of Nations. She retired as director of the Wheelock School in 1939. The school, which then had 325 students and 23 faculty members, was incorporated in that year, and in 1941 it became Wheelock College.
