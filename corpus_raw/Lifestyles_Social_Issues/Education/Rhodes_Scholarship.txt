Rhodes scholarship,  educational grant to the University of Oxford established in 1902 by the will of Cecil Rhodes for the purpose of promoting unity among English-speaking nations. The scholarship’s requirements were revised over the years, and by the early 21st century students from all countries were eligible. The scholarships are for two years, with a third year at the discretion of the trustees.
Until 1976, candidates had to be unmarried males between the ages of 19 and 25 and citizens of, and have at least five years’ residency in, the British Commonwealth or colonies, the Republic of South Africa, or the United States. Candidates from Germany were considered in 1903–14 and 1930–39, and from 1970 two candidates were chosen each year from the Federal Republic of Germany. Students from additional countries subsequently became eligible, and in 2018 the scholarships were opened to students of all nations. Beginning in 1976, women were accepted as candidates. It was Rhodes’s wish that while at Oxford the scholars be distributed among all the colleges, as far as possible in accordance with their own inclinations; acceptance of any scholar, however, is determined by the colleges themselves.
