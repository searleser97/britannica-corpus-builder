Sir Henry Cole, pseudonym Felix Summerly,  (born July 15, 1808, Bath, Somerset, England—died April 18, 1882, London), English public servant, art patron, and educator who is significant in the history of industrial design for his recognition of the importance of combining art and industry.
At the age of 15 Cole started clerking for the public-records historian, and eventually he became assistant keeper of the public-records office. In 1845 the Society of Arts, the new patron of which was Queen Victoria’s consort, Prince Albert, announced a competition that resulted in “Summerly’s” tea service, designed by Cole and manufactured by Minton’s pottery works. Cole explained that its design “had as much beauty and ornament as is consistent with cheapness.” Much thought was given to fitting form to function. The tea service sold well, and in 1847 Cole founded Summerly’s Art Manufactures, through which painters and sculptors designed for industries. In 1849 Cole and the painter Richard Redgrave founded The Journal of Design and Manufactures, a publication dedicated to the promotion of “the germs of a style which England of the nineteenth century may call its own.” In 1848 Cole proposed an unprecedented Great Exhibition of the industry of all nations. It opened in 1851 and was a resounding triumph, featuring “art applied to industry.”
The success of the Great Exhibition encouraged better design schooling in England. In 1852 the Board of Trade set up a department of practical art (later, of science and art) with Cole as secretary; in this capacity he formed the nucleus of the Victoria and Albert Museum. In 1873 he resigned his secretaryship and in 1875 was made Knight Commander of the Bath.
