The college was founded in 1861 by Matthew Vassar, but the American Civil War delayed its opening until 1865. It was then a college for women, dedicated to providing women with the high calibre of education previously only available to men. In 1898, Vassar became the first women’s college to have a chapter of the Phi Beta Kappa honorary society. For a brief time following World War II, the college admitted a small number of male students (all of them being war veterans); however, a permanent coeducational policy was not in place until 1969. Noteworthy alumnae include poets Edna St. Vincent Millay and Elizabeth Bishop, novelist Mary McCarthy, computer technology pioneer Grace Hopper, scientist Christine Ladd-Franklin, publisher Katherine Graham, and actress Jane Fonda.
