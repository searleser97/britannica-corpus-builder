Coe College,  private, coeducational institution of higher learning in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, U.S. It is affiliated with the Presbyterian Church (USA), though it maintains an ecumenical outlook. Coe offers an undergraduate curriculum in the liberal arts that includes off-campus programs in Washington, D.C., and New York City, in addition to study-abroad opportunities in Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Total enrollment is approximately 1,300.
The college was established in 1851 by Presbyterian minister Williston Jones, and its first classes were conducted in his home. A gift from Daniel Coe, a farmer in upstate New York, paved the way for the school to be incorporated as the Cedar Rapids Collegiate Institute in 1853. It subsequently was renamed Parsons Seminary and Coe Collegiate Institute and became Coe College in 1881. The college absorbed Leander Clark College in 1919. The Stewart Memorial Library contains an art collection that includes works by such Iowa natives as Grant Wood and Marvin Cone.
