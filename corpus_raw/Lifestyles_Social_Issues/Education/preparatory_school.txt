Preparatory school,   school that prepares students for entrance to a higher school. In Europe, where secondary education has been selective, preparatory schools have been those that catered to pupils wishing to enter the academic secondary schools. In North America, where secondary education has been less selective and entry to it less competitive, the term generally refers to private secondary schools that prepare students for universities.
In England, for example, the preparatory (or prep) schools, which began in the 19th century, form an integral part of the private or independent school system. Boys or girls enter the preparatory schools at about the age of 8 and usually leave between the ages of 11 and 13, often to attend one of the private secondary institutions (see public school). In Germany this type of elementary private preparatory school (see Vorschule) was abolished shortly after World War I. In France the preparatory classes (classes préparatoires) attached to the state secondary schools (see lycée), were formerly fee-paying; the differences between these and elementary classes in other schools, however, have been abolished so that French elementary education has become identical everywhere.
In the United States a very high proportion of preparatory school graduates enter college or university. The age of enrollment in preparatory school is about 14, and the four- or five-year course is usually geared to meet the requirements of either the college entrance examination board or a particular institution. This kind of secondary private preparatory school is found in only a few other countries, such as Japan.
