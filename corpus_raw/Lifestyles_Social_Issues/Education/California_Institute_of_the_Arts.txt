California Institute of the Arts, byname CalArts,  private coeducational institution of higher learning in Valencia, California, U.S., dedicated to the visual and performing arts. It consists of six schools: art, critical studies, dance, film/video, music, and theatre. An integrated media program provides graduate study in digital media. Bachelor and master of fine arts degrees are awarded. Special programs—including world music, puppetry, and video art—cross traditional disciplines. The institute includes a computer animation laboratory, and the music school features computer music studios. Theatre students are urged to participate in all aspects of the production and presentation of works, from conception to realization. The film/video school is among the leading institutions of its kind in the country. Total enrollment is approximately 1,200.
The Los Angeles Conservatory of Music was founded in 1883, and the Chouinard Art Institute was established in 1921. The Disney Company was the catalyst in the two schools’ merger in 1961 to form the California Institute of the Arts. CalArts was conceived as a community of artists; almost all of its facilities—classrooms, studios, theatres, workshops, galleries, library, and administration offices—are housed in a single 500,000-square-foot (46,450-square-metre) building in the midst of a 60-acre (24-hectare) campus. In addition, there are several annexes and graduate art studios. The school’s Community Arts Partnership teaches young students throughout the Los Angeles area. Jazz artist Charlie Haden founded CalArts’ jazz program, and actor Ed Harris and director Tim Burton are among the school’s noted graduates.
