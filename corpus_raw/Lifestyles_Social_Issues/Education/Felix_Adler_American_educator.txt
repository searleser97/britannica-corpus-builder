Felix Adler,   (born Aug. 13, 1851, Alzey, Hesse-Darmstadt [Germany]—died  April 24, 1933, New York, N.Y., U.S.), American educator and founder of the Ethical Movement.
The son of a rabbi, Adler immigrated to the United States with his family in 1856 and graduated from Columbia College in 1870. After study at the Universities of Berlin and Heidelberg, he became professor of Hebrew and Oriental literature at Cornell University, Ithaca, N.Y. In 1902 he was appointed professor of political and social ethics at Columbia University.
In 1876 Adler established in New York City the Society for Ethical Culture. This marked the beginning of the Ethical Movement, the aim of which was to assert the importance of the moral factor in all life’s relations, without regard to considerations of a supreme being.
Adler took a prominent part in social reform movements, such as the erection of model tenement houses and the abolition of child labour. Among his writings are Creed and Deed (1877), The Moral Instruction of Children (1892), The World Crisis and Its Meaning (1915), An Ethical Philosophy of Life (1918), and The Reconstruction of the Spiritual Ideal (Hibbert lectures at Oxford, 1923).
