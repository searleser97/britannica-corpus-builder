Eton College,   near Windsor, Berkshire, one of England’s largest independent secondary schools and one of the highest in prestige. It was founded by Henry VI in 1440–41 for 70 highly qualified boys who received scholarships from a fund endowed by the king. Simultaneously, Henry founded King’s College, Cambridge, to which scholars from Eton were to proceed. That connection is no longer in place.
Today, as throughout the school’s history, Eton names about 14 King’s Scholars, or Collegers, each year, for a schoolwide total of 70. The selection is based on the results of a competitive examination open to boys between 12 and 14 years of age. King’s Scholars are awarded scholarships ranging from 10 to 100 percent of fees and are boarded in special quarters in the college.
The other students, called Oppidans, now number more than 1,200 and are housed in boardinghouses under the care of house masters. The Oppidans have traditionally come from England’s wealthiest and most prestigious families, many of them aristocratic. Boys enter Eton about age 13 and continue there until they are ready to enter university.
