Bryn Mawr was the first institution of higher learning in the United States to offer graduate instruction to women; men were first admitted to the graduate program in 1931. Under the leadership of Martha Carey Thomas (president from 1894 to 1922) the standard for the education of women rose dramatically. Notable alumnae include poets H.D. (Hilda Doolittle) and Marianne Moore, actress Katharine Hepburn, and geneticist Nettie Stevens. The faculty has included U.S. President Woodrow Wilson and Nobel Prize-winning geneticist Thomas Hunt Morgan.
