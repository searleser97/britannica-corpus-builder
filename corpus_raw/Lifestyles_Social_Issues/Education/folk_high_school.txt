Folk high school,  type of residential school for adults that is standard in Scandinavian countries and has also been adopted elsewhere in Europe. The concept of the folk high school was originated in Denmark by the theologian N.F.S. Grundtvig as a means of providing the common people with a knowledge of their history, religion, and cultural heritage. The model school for the movement was established by the young educator Kristen Kold in 1851 and was soon extensively imitated. Following Denmarkâ€™s military defeat by Prussia in 1864, these folk high schools served as a powerful instrument of national regeneration. There are no entrance qualifications, grades, or leaving examinations. The schools are private but receive state subsidies. Courses are short in duration, lasting from several weeks to one year, and are offered in vocational training, physical education, foreign language, the arts, and subjects of general interest in literature and social science. Informal group discussions, cultural enrichment activities, and recreational outings supplement the classroom curriculum. Residential life is also a cornerstone of the learning experience; students and teachers live, work, and play together. Most students are young adults, and many folk high schools attract an international body of students.
