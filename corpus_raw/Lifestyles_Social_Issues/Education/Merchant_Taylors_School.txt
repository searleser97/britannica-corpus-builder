Merchant Taylors’ School,  one of the major public (privately endowed) schools in England. Since 1933 it has been located at Sandy Lodge, at the northwestern extreme of London. The school was founded (1561) by the Merchant Taylors’ Company of London, an incorporated group of craftsmen tailors. It was located at Suffolk Lane until 1875, when it was moved to Charterhouse Square. Richard Mulcaster was the first headmaster, and one of his pupils was Edmund Spenser. The school’s library (1662) is known for its collection of rare old books. Other schools with the same name, founded by other trade or craft associations, have existed elsewhere in England.
