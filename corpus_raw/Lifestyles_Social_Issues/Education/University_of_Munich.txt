University of Munich, in full Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, German Ludwig-Maximilians Universität München,  autonomous coeducational institution of higher learning supported by the state of Bavaria in Germany. It was founded in 1472 at Ingolstadt by the duke of Bavaria, who modeled it after the University of Vienna. During the Protestant Reformation, Johann Eck made the university a centre of Roman Catholic opposition to Martin Luther. In 1799 schools of economics and political science were established, and the following year King Maximilian Joseph moved the school to Landshut, giving it the name Ludwig Maximilian. The dukes of Bavaria continued their strong support for the school, and in 1826 King Louis I moved it to Munich. A technical school with courses in agriculture and forestry was founded in 1868. The university’s faculty of Catholic theology continues to be influential, although a faculty of Protestant theology has been added. Affiliated with the University of Munich are more than 200 constituent institutes, seminars, and clinics.
