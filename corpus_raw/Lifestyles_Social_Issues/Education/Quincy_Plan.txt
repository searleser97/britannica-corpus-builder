Quincy Plan, also called Quincy Method,  experimental, progressive, child-centred approach to education introduced in 1875 in Quincy, Mass., U.S., by superintendent of schools Francis W. Parker. Parker eliminated the rigid formalities of traditional school routine, arranged interrelated subjects around a central core, and emphasized socialized activities and creative self-expression. The curriculum included field trips, art, music, crafts, science, and physical training, with the purpose of developing each childâ€™s individual personality. In 1883, when Parker became principal of the Cook County Normal School in Chicago, he further elaborated on the Quincy Plan, actively campaigned against the methods of traditional schools, and trained teachers who introduced modern educational methods.
