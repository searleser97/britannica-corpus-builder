William Moon,  (born December 18, 1818, Horsmonden, England—died October 10, 1894, Brighton), British activist and inventor of Moon type, a system of embossed typography for the blind based on simplified forms of the Latin alphabet.
Moon’s vision was severely damaged by scarlet fever when he was a child and worsened throughout his adolescence, in spite of several surgeries. Although he faced considerable challenges in reading and writing, Moon was an excellent student and went on to study for the ministry. He became familiar with several existing systems of embossed type for the blind. After his sight deteriorated to the point of total blindness in 1840, Moon committed himself to teaching other blind people to read by touch. Within two years he had opened a day school for the blind in Brighton.
Many of Moon’s students, especially adults and those who had become blind later in life, failed to master the existing systems of embossed scripts, leading him to the conclusion that those systems were too complex to ever be widely adopted. In 1845 he devised his own, which he based on Latin (Roman) letters—the standard script for the English language—and could be learned by blind adults in a few days. Moon began developing a literature in his new script. The first publications appeared in 1847. From the 1850s onward, the script was transferred to India, China, Egypt, Australia, and West Africa by missionaries.
Moon’s script was the first reading system for the blind to be widely adopted across the world, but it was costly to print. It was overtaken in the late 19th century by Braille, which was cheaper and could be produced by blind individuals for themselves. Moon’s system is still used by some people whose fingertips lack the sensitivity to use Braille.
