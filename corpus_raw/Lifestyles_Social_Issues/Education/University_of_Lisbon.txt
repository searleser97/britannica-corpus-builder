University of Lisbon, Portuguese Universidade De Lisboa,  coeducational state institution of higher learning at Lisbon. The modern university, restored in 1911, traces its history, together with that of the University of Coimbra, to the medieval University of Lisbon founded in 1288. King Dinis of Portugal endowed a studium generale, a place of study accepting scholars from all over Europe and conferring a recognized degree. The university subsequently was moved several times to Coimbra and back to Lisbon. It remained in Lisbon from 1377 to 1537, when it again migrated, this time permanently, to Coimbra.
In 1911 the present sister university was founded in Lisbon. Modern faculties include science, letters, law, pharmacy, medicine, and psychology and educational science.
