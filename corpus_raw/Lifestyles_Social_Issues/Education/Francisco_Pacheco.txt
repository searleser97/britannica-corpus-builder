Francisco Pacheco,  (born 1564, Sanlúcar de Barrameda, Spain—died 1654, Sevilla), Spanish painter, teacher, and scholar. Although an undistinguished artist himself, he is remembered as the teacher of both Diego Velázquez and Alonso Cano and as the author of Arte de la pintura (1649), a treatise on the art of painting that is the most important document for the study of 17th-century Spanish art.
Moving to Sevilla (Seville) early in his life, Pacheco studied painting under Luis Fernández, learning primarily by copying the work of Italian Renaissance masters. After visiting (1611) Madrid and Toledo, where he studied the work of El Greco, he returned to Sevilla and opened an academy. His instructions were marked by an emphasis on academic correctness. The official censor of the Inquisition in Sevilla, Pacheco concerned himself with the proper way of depicting religious themes and images.
Such paintings as the Last Judgment (1614) in the convent of Santa Isabel and the Martyrs of Granada are highly imitative and rigid works, monumental but unimpressive. Although Velázquez became Pacheco’s son-in-law, he was uninfluenced by his father-in-law’s art.
Pacheco’s Arte de la pintura, in addition to chapters on iconography and the theory and practice of painting, includes a series of biographies of contemporary Spanish painters that is most valuable to scholars.
