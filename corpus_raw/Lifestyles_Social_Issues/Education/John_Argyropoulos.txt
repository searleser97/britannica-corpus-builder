John Argyropoulos,  (born 1415, Constantinople [now Istanbul, Turkey]—died  June 26, 1487, Rome, Papal States [Italy]), Byzantine humanist and active promoter of the revival of Classical learning in the West.
As a teacher in Constantinople, Argyropoulos had among his pupils the scholar Constantine Lascaris. Argyropoulos divided his time between Italy and Constantinople; he was in Italy (1439) for the Council of Florence and spent some time teaching and studying in Padua, earning a degree in 1443. When Constantinople fell in 1453 he left it for the Peloponnese and in 1456 took refuge in Italy. He was professor of Greek in Florence for 15 years before moving to Rome, where he continued to teach Greek until his death. He left a number of Latin translations, including many of Aristotle’s works, but his real importance lies in his work as a teacher in Italy.
