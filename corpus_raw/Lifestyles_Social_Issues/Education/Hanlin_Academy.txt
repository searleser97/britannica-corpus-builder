Hanlin Academy, Chinese (Pinyin) Hanlin Yuan, (Wade-Giles romanization) Han-lin Yüan,  elite scholarly institution founded in the 8th century ad in China to perform secretarial, archival, and literary tasks for the court and to establish the official interpretation of the Confucian Classics, which were the basis of the civil-service examinations necessary for entrance into the upper levels of the official bureaucracy. The academy lasted until 1911.
The academy was created by the emperor Xuazong (reigned ad 712–756) of the Tang dynasty. Although at first membership in the academy was not confined to scholars and included court favourites, jugglers, and musicians, by the time of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) admittance to the body had become an honour bestowing great prestige and was granted only to the outstanding recipients of the jinshi degree, the highest level of the examination system. Under the subsequent Qing dynasty (1644–1911/12), the Hanlin Academy, as the highest academic institution in China, was often referred to by westerners as the National, or Imperial, Academy or the Board of Academicians.
Hanlin scholars functioned as the emperor’s close advisers and confidential secretaries. They recorded the emperor’s words and deeds, drafted and compiled the imperial edicts, tutored members of the imperial family and the palace eunuchs, worked on new interpretations of the Confucian Classics, edited historical records, and prepared encyclopaedias of world knowledge. But the orientation of the academy was so traditional that in the imperial encyclopaedia of 1747 the Hanlin scholars were able to call the description of the five continents by the Jesuit missionary Matteo Ricci a “wild fabulous story” that was obviously not in accord with China’s position as the centre of the world. The academy ended when the Qing dynasty was overthrown.
