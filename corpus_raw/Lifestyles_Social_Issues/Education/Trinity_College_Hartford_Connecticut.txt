The first campus opened in 1825; it was sold in 1872 to become the site of the state capitol. In 1845 the college received its present name, and in 1878 it moved to its current campus, which was designed in the Gothic Revival style by British architect William Burges. Trinity College added a graduate degree program in 1888. Thereafter it also began to separate itself from the Episcopal church. Women were first admitted as undergraduates in the late 1960s.
