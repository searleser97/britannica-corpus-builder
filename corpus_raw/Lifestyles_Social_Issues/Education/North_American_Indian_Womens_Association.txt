North American Indian Women’s Association (NAIWA),  organization created in 1970 by Marie Cox and others to foster fellowship between American Indian women. NAIWA was the first organization established expressly to address the unique role of its members as both women and American Indians. The nonprofit organization, whose founding was sponsored by the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs, has for several years had a sizable contingent of Canadian members. 
NAIWA’s members are women from federally recognized American Indian tribes. Though much of the organization’s agenda focuses on promoting the status of and opportunities for American Indian women in the country at large, its underlying aims are to improve communication between American Indians on the individual and tribal levels and to increase knowledge of American Indian culture. To further these aims, local and regional sodalities throughout the United States and Canada hold an annual convention. There members discuss such issues as proper medical treatment, education, and economic and social advancement.
