James Cleland,  (flourished  17th century, England), English author whose 1607 book, The Institution of a Young Nobleman, advocated an all-round rather than strictly classical education.
Little is known of Cleland’s life except that he was a Scotsman living in England. The book was published at Oxford, but he was apparently neither educated at Oxford nor connected with the university in any other way.
Cleland’s book is notable for its emphasis upon and praise of English vernacular; the young nobleman is urged to speak English well before attempting to speak Latin. Reading history, according to Cleland, is the nobleman’s most important study, but mathematics, architecture, law, geography, philosophy, languages (especially French), and the humanities are also necessary to a proper education.
Cleland departed from tradition in viewing education in a broad context of learning experiences rather than as limited to strict training in the classics. In his book he advocated foreign travel and emphasized learning correct behaviour and manners, the duty of parents toward children, wise teaching techniques, the training of sound judgment, and even physical exercises.
