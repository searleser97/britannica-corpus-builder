Barbara Leigh Smith Bodichon, née Smith,  (born April 8, 1827, Watlington, Norfolk [now Oxfordshire], Eng.—died June 11, 1891, Robertsbridge, Sussex [now East Sussex]), English leader in the movement for the education and political rights of women who was instrumental in founding Girton College, Cambridge.
In 1857 Barbara Smith married an eminent French physician, Eugène Bodichon, continuing, however, to lead the movements that she had initiated on behalf of English women. In 1854 she had published her Brief Summary in Plain Language of the Most Important Laws Concerning Women, which had a useful effect in helping forward the passage of the Married Women’s Property Act. In 1866, cooperating with Emily Davies, she proposed a plan for the extension of university education to women, and the first small experiment, a college at Hitchin, developed into Girton College, Cambridge, to which Bodichon gave liberally of her time and money. She studied under the English artist William Henry Hunt, and her watercolours showed originality and talent.
