Herman Harrell Horne,  (born Nov. 22, 1874, Clayton, N.C., U.S.—died  Aug. 16, 1946, Leonia, N.J.), American educational philosopher who represented the idealistic viewpoint in contrast to the pragmatism of John Dewey and his followers.
Horne earned his undergraduate and master’s degrees at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill (1895) and received his doctorate in philosophy at Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass. (1899). Horne’s teaching career spanned nearly half a century. He taught philosophy at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H., from 1899 to 1909 and then taught at New York University (NYU) in New York City from 1909 to 1942.
Horne wrote more than 20 books, along with numerous articles, and he was the first professor to broadcast a lecture over the radio. A recognized spokesperson for the idealistic point of view, he analyzed and criticized Dewey’s Democracy and Education in a book entitled The Democratic Philosophy of Education (1932), Horne’s best-known work. Others of his books presenting the idealistic position in education include The Philosophy of Education (1904), Psychological Principles of Education (1906), Idealism in Education (1910), and This New Education (1931).
