Guillaume Budé, Latin Guglielmus Budaeus,  (born Jan. 26, 1467, Paris, Fr.—died  Aug. 20, 1540, Paris), French scholar who brought about a revival of classical studies in France and helped to found the Collège de France, Paris; he was also a diplomat and royal librarian.
Educated in Paris and Orléans, he became especially proficient in Greek, learning philosophy, law, theology, and medicine as well. In 1502 King Louis XII sent him to Rome as French ambassador to the coronation of Pope Julius II. He later returned to Paris, served as a king’s secretary until 1515, then traveled again to Rome as ambassador to Pope Leo X. When the new king, Francis I, appointed him royal librarian upon his return to Paris from this second mission, Budé directed the assembling in the Fontainebleau Palace of various royal manuscript collections; the library that he built formed the nucleus of today’s French national library, the Bibliothèque Nationale. To his king, Budé suggested the creation of a college for the study of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew. After some difficulties, this institution opened in 1530; it became a centre for higher studies in France and reawakened interest in classical languages and literature.
Budé’s Commentarii linguae Graecae (1529; “Commentaries on the Greek Language”), one of his many books, was instrumental in the classical revival. See also France, Collège de.
