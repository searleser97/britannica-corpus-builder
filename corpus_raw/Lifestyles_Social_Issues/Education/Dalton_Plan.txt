Dalton Plan,   secondary-education technique based on individual learning. Developed by Helen Parkhurst in 1919, it was at first introduced at a school for the handicapped and then in 1920 in the high school of Dalton, Mass. The plan had grown out of the reaction of some progressive educators to the inadequacies inherent in the conventional grading system, which ignored individual variables in learning speed.
The Dalton Plan divided each subject in the schoolâ€™s curriculum into monthly assignments. Although pupils were free to plan their own work schedules, they were responsible for finishing one assignment before starting another. Pupils were encouraged to work in groups. Although popular for a time in the United States, Great Britain, Europe, and the Western colonial world, the Dalton Plan was criticized for being too individualistic and was finally given up.
