Northwestern University,  private, coeducational university in Evanston, Illinois, U.S. Northwestern University is a comprehensive research institution and a member of the Association of American Colleges and Universities. Northwestern’s undergraduate, graduate, and professional degree programs are among the most highly regarded in the United States. Total enrollment is approximately 21,000.
The university was founded in 1851 by a group of businessmen and professionals, led by physician John Evans. It was created to serve the area of the Northwest Territory—an area that now includes the states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin and part of Minnesota. Instruction began in 1855, and women were first admitted in 1869. When the university merged with the Evanston College for Ladies in 1873, educator and reformer Frances Willard became its first dean of women.
Northwestern is divided into 11 schools and colleges: the Judd A. and Marjorie Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences (1851), the Feinberg School of Medicine (1859), the J.L. Kellogg Graduate School of Management (1908), the Robert R. McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science (1909), the Graduate School (1910), the Medill School of Journalism, Media, Integrated Marketing Communications (1921), the Henry and Leigh Bienen School of Music (1859), and the Schools of Communication (1878), Law (1859), Education and Social Policy (1926), and Continuing Studies (1933). The university’s campus in Chicago is the site of its law and medical schools. In 2008 the university opened a campus in Qatar, which offers degree programs in journalism and communications. Research facilities include the Center for Learning and Organizational Change, the Institute for Policy Research, the Center for Public Safety, and the Materials Research Science and Engineering Center.
U.S. Senator George McGovern, U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice John Paul Stevens, Nobel Prize-winning economist George J. Stigler, and author Saul Bellow are among Northwestern’s notable alumni.
