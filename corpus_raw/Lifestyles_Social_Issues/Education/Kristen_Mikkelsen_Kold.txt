Kristen Mikkelsen Kold,  (born March 29, 1816, Jutland, Den.—died  April 6, 1870, Dalem), educator who did more than anyone else of his time to promote the folk high-school movement in Denmark.
Kold was a shoemaker’s son and was educated as a teacher, but he found himself unable to adapt to the highly formal educational system. Instead, he founded a residential school in 1851 at Ryslinge, where, living frugally with his students, he carried on most of his instruction orally and stressed moral development more than intellectual teachings. Many leaders of the modern Danish state were educated in his folk high schools and those modeled after them. The adaptations of these schools that eventually appeared throughout the world usually reflected Kold’s intensely personal approach to education.
