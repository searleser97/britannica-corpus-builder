Evelyn Wood, née Evelyn Nielsen,  (born January 8, 1909, Logan, Utah, U.S.—died August 26, 1995, Tucson, Arizona), American educator who developed a widely used system of high-speed reading.
The daughter of Mormon parents, she graduated from the University of Utah in 1929 and married Myron Douglas Wood that same year. In the 1930s she helped her husband in his missionary activities and then began teaching in a high school in Utah. She received a master’s degree from the University of Utah in 1947. While teaching remedial reading at various high schools in the 1950s, she began developing techniques to help slow readers read more quickly with increased comprehension. She undertook a systematic study of high-speed reading and its associated skills, and by 1958 she was teaching students at the University of Utah to read at speeds of several thousand words per minute.
The key technique in her system, which she called Reading Dynamics, was the use of the hand as a pacer as the eyes followed its rapid zigzag motion down each page. In 1959 she opened the first Evelyn Wood Reading Dynamics Institute, in Washington, D.C. It was followed by many more such learning centres. Wood’s system, useful in school and business environments, stressed overall improvements in reading efficiency, including comprehension and word retention, as well as large increases in reading speeds.
