Elizabeth Harrison,  (born Sept. 1, 1849, Athens, Ky., U.S.—died Oct. 31, 1927, San Antonio, Texas), American educator, a major force in establishing standards and a college for the training of kindergarten teachers.
Harrison encountered the fledgling kindergarten movement on a visit to Chicago in 1879, and she promptly enrolled in a training class for teachers. She taught in kindergartens in Chicago and Marshalltown, Iowa, and received professional training in St. Louis, Missouri, and New York. She settled in Chicago in 1883 and became the city’s most active organizer of kindergarten activities and teachers. She helped found the Chicago Kindergarten Club, a discussion association of kindergarten teachers, and she was soon lecturing regularly to groups of interested parents.
Harrison began training teachers in 1885, and two years later she led in formally establishing a school for kindergarten teachers and mothers that in 1891 was incorporated as the Chicago Kindergarten College. From 1887 to 1894 the school and the club together, under the name Chicago Literary Schools, sponsored an annual lecture series, and in 1894, 1895, and 1896 Harrison organized national conferences of mothers that helped pave the way for the National Congress of Mothers (now the National Congress of Parents and Teachers, or PTA), founded in 1897.
The Chicago Kindergarten College was her principal concern, and although the high standards she set for it—notably requiring a high-school diploma for entrance and a three-year training course—created a permanent threat of insolvency, the college became a model for others throughout the country. (After several changes of name it became in 1930 the National College of Education, now part of National-Louis University.)
Among Harrison’s writings were A Study of Child Nature, which went through more than 50 editions after its first publication in 1890, In Storyland (1895), Some Silent Teachers (1903), Misunderstood Children (1908), When Children Err (1916), and The Unseen Side of Child Life (1922). In 1913, after inspecting the work of Maria Montessori in Rome, Harrison wrote an influential report, Montessori and the Kindergarten, for the U.S. Bureau of Education.
Harrison retired from teaching and from the presidency of her National Kindergarten and Elementary College in 1920.
