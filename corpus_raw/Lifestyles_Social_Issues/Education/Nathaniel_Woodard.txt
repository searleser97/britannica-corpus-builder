Nathaniel Woodard,  (born March 21, 1811, Basildon, Essex, Eng.—died  April 25, 1891, Henfield, Sussex), Anglican priest and founder of middle class public schools. An Oxford graduate (1840), he was ordained a priest in 1842. Although he was not an outstanding scholar, he possessed a genius for organization and for attracting funds. He saw the need for good schools for the middle classes, schools that would combine Anglican teaching with the advantages of English public school education at a moderate cost.
His first schools, called the Woodard Schools, were St. Nicolas at Lancing for the upper middle class, St. John’s at Hurstpierpoint for the middle class, and St. Saviour’s at Ardingly for the lower middle class. Later he opened a number of boys’ and girls’ schools in different parts of the country.
In 1870 Woodard was appointed canon residentiary of Manchester. His tomb is in the chapel of Lancing College.
