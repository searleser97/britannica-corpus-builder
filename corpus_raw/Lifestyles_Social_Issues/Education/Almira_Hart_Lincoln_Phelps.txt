Almira Hart Lincoln Phelps, née Almira Hart,  (born July 15, 1793, Berlin, Connecticut, U.S.—died July 15, 1884, Baltimore, Maryland), 19th-century American educator and writer who strove to raise the academic standards of education for girls.
Almira Hart was a younger sister of Emma Hart Willard. She was educated at home, in district schools, for a time by Emma, and in 1812 at an academy in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. After a year of teaching at the Berlin Academy, she briefly conducted a school of her own in her family’s home and then in 1816 became principal of an academy in Sandy Hill, New York. In 1817 she married Simeon Lincoln, editor of the Connecticut Mirror of Hartford. After his death in 1823 she became a teacher in New York in her sister’s Troy Female Seminary, where she remained for eight years.
In 1829 Lincoln published a textbook, Familiar Lectures on Botany, which enjoyed wide use and went through nine editions in 10 years. She married John Phelps in 1831. Over the next several years she published Lectures to Young Ladies (1833), Botany for Beginners (1833), Geology for Beginners (1834), Chemistry for Beginners (1834), Natural Philosophy for Beginners (1836), Lectures on Natural Philosophy (1836), and Lectures on Chemistry (1837). She also wrote a novel, Caroline Westerly (1833). In 1838 she became principal of the Young Ladies’ Seminary in West Chester, Pennsylvania. When the school closed the next year, she became head of the Female Institute of Rahway, New Jersey.
In 1841 Phelps became principal and her husband business manager of the Patapsco Female Institute in Ellicott’s Mills, Maryland. In her 15 years at that school, Phelps created an institution of high academic standards, with a curriculum rich in the sciences, mathematics, and natural history and designed in particular to train highly qualified teachers. The polite attainments that passed for education in most girls’ schools of the time were not entirely ignored but were considered to be of secondary importance.
In 1856 Phelps retired and settled in Baltimore. In her remaining years she wrote frequently for national periodicals. Her other books include Ida Norman (1848), a novel; Christian Households (1858); and Hours with My Pupils (1859). In 1859 she became the second woman to be elected to the American Association for the Advancement of Science, following Maria Mitchell.
