University of Nantes, French Universit√© De Nantes,  autonomous, state-financed coeducational institution of higher learning at Nantes, in western France. Founded in 1970 under the 1968 law reforming French higher education, the university replaced the former University of Nantes founded in 1962, which in turn had its origins in the University of Nantes established by papal bull in 1460, and the University of Angers authorized by Charles V in 1364.
The university is organized into a series of teaching and research units, each academically and administratively independent. It offers programs in law and economics, business administration, medicine, the sciences, pharmacy, and liberal arts, among other fields. An Institute of Technology offers two-year courses.
