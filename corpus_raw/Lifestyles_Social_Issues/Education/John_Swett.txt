John Swett,  (born July 31, 1830, Pittsfield, New Hampshire, U.S.—died August 22, 1913, Alhambra, California), American educator known as the father of the California public school system.
Swett was educated at the Pittsfield and Pembroke academies and at the Merrimack Normal Institute. He had become a teacher at the age of 17, but he left New England in 1852, spending most of the next year working in California mines and on a ranch. When Swett took a job as principal of San Francisco’s Rincon School, he immediately began organizing the city’s public schools, and in 1862 he was elected California superintendent of public instruction. He served in that post until 1867, during which time he organized teachers’ institutes, established a teacher-certification system, won legislative support for school taxes, wrote a revised school law, and provided for uniform textbooks throughout the California public school system.
Defeated for reelection in 1867, Swett became principal of the Denman girls’ school in San Francisco in 1868 and stayed there until 1876, except for a brief stint (1870–73) as deputy superintendent of the San Francisco public schools. He finished his long career in public education as superintendent of San Francisco schools (1892–96).
Swett wrote many books, addresses, and magazine articles. His works include Common School Readings (1867), A History of the Public School System of California (1876), Methods of Teaching (1880), School Elocution (1884), American Public Schools (1900), and Public Education in California (1911).
