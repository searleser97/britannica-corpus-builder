University of Calcutta,  state-controlled institution of higher learning founded by the British in India in 1857. Modeled on the University of London, Calcutta was originally a purely affiliating university that offered no actual instruction but was the examining and degree-granting authority for colleges scattered over most of northern India. Since 1904 it has gradually added teaching to its supervisory functions. By the mid-1970s Calcutta was one of the largest universities in the world, with 13 colleges under its direct control and more than 150 affiliated colleges, as well as 16 postgraduate faculties. The faculties of ancient Indian history and culture and of applied mathematics and the institute of radiophysics and electronics are the state-designated centres of advanced study in those fields. The language of instruction is English.
