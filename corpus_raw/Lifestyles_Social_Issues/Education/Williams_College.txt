Williams College,  private, coeducational institution of higher learning opened in 1791 and founded as a college in 1793 at Williamstown, Massachusetts, U.S. Like many other New England colleges, Williams was established by the Congregational church, but it is now nondenominational. It offers undergraduate liberal arts and graduate programs in fine and applied arts and social sciences. There are special accelerated and honours programs, as well as opportunities for independent study and study abroad. Williams participates in the Twelve College Exchange program, and cross-registration arrangements are maintained with Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts (formerly North Adams State College) and Bennington College.
Notable campus buildings include Hopkins Hall, named for former college president Mark Hopkins; Chapin Hall, housing the Chapin Library of Rare Books; and Lawrence Hall, home of the Williams College Museum of Art. Among its prominent former students are the poet William Cullen Bryant (who is said to have written his “Thanatopsis” there) and President James A. Garfield. Total enrollment is about 2,000.
