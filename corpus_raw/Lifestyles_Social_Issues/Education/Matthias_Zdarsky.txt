Matthias Zdarsky,  (born Feb. 25, 1856, Trebitsch, Moravia, Austrian Empire [now in Czech Republic]—died  June 20, 1940, Sankt Pölten, Austria), ski instructor who was considered the father of Alpine skiing and who was probably the first regular ski instructor in Austria.
Zdarsky became interested in skiing after reading Fridtjof Nansen’s Auf Schneeschuhen durch Grönland (1891; Across Greenland on Snowshoes) and taught himself to ski as the easiest way to reach the market village of Lilienfeld in winter from his mountain pastures of Habernreith, which he had bought in 1889. He had to adapt the Nordic skiing techniques used on relatively flat ground to the Alpine terrain. In 1897 he published Die alpine Lilienfelder Skifahrtechnik, the first ski instruction book. In it he publicized the technique of requiring one ski to be extended at an acute angle to the fall line, a line from an upper point to a lower directly below on a slope. He first used a single pole to help in steering and turning, and he remained committed to the practice even after the use of two poles became standard. Stemming, as his steering moves were called, was performed by turning one ski to the side, in whichever direction the turn was intended, and quickly bringing the other ski into parallel position, a maneuver known as the stem Christiania. Zdarsky also improved ski design and ski bindings and organized downhill races. He was a ski instructor for the Austrian Army during World War I and survived an avalanche that caused 80 fractures and dislocations. He invented devices that allowed him to ski again.
