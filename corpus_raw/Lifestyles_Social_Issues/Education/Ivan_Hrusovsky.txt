Hrušovský studied composition at the Bratislava Conservatory and the Academy of Musical Arts, graduating in 1957. As a theoretition, he was concerned with the development of Slovak music since the 19th century, and he wrote a number of articles on the subject. He is best known, however, for his lyrical musical compositions, most of which are firmly rooted in the eastern European musical tradition. His compositions include a piano sonata, a violin sonata, several orchestral works, works for chorus, and two works for electronic tape.
