Jean-Joseph Jacotot,  (born March 4, 1770, Dijon, France—died  July 30, 1840, Paris), French pedagogue and innovator of a universal method of education.
Jacotot began his career as a teacher and mathematician and was appointed subdirector of the Polytechnic School in Dijon (1795), where he became, in succession, professor of the method of sciences, of Latin and Greek literature, and of Roman law. During the Napoleonic Wars he entered the army and rose to the rank of captain of artillery; he then became military secretary and director of the military École Normale and was elected a member of the Chamber of Deputies. In 1818 he became lecturer on French language and literature at the Catholic University of Leuven (Louvain).
On the basis of his unusually diverse experience, Jacotot wrote Enseignement universel (1823; “Universal Teaching Method”), in which he advanced an egalitarian view of humanity in such maxims as “All human beings are equally capable of learning” and “Everybody can be proficient in anything to which he turns his attention.” He also maintained that all knowledge is related, so that, knowing one thing well, one could apply it to other fields of knowledge.
