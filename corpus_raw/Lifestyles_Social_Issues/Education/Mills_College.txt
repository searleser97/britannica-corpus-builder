Mills College grew from the Young Ladies’ Seminary established at Benicia, California, in 1852. Teaching missionaries Cyrus Mills and his wife, Susan Lincoln Tolman Mills, bought the school in 1865, obtained farmland at Oakland for the campus, and in 1877 deeded the school to a board of trustees. In 1885 the school became a college, claiming to be the first women’s college west of the Rocky Mountains. It began offering graduate courses in 1920. Among its notable teachers were Dean Rusk, later U.S. secretary of state, and composer Darius Milhaud. Milhaud’s students at Mills included composer William Bolcom and jazz pianist Dave Brubeck.
