Oglethorpe University,  private, coeducational institution of higher learning in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S. The university comprises nine divisions offering undergraduate study in the arts, humanities, business, and sciences. It also offers a masterâ€™s degree program in early childhood education. The campus is distinguished by its English Gothic architecture. At the turn of the 21st century, total enrollment was more than 1,000.
The university was founded by a group of Presbyterians in 1835, and it was named for James Edward Oglethorpe, founder of the Georgia colony. The university was then located in Midway, Georgia, and featured a curriculum of classics and natural sciences. The American Civil War forced the closing of the university in 1862. It reopened in 1870 in Atlanta, with business and law courses added, but it was forced to close after two years. Oglethorpe was rechartered in 1913, and the cornerstone of its new campus was laid two years later. In that reincarnation Oglethorpe became a nonsectarian institution. Poet Sidney Lanier and baseball player Luke Appling were graduates of Oglethorpe. The university hosted the Georgia Shakespeare Festival from its inception in 1986 to its demise in 2014.
