Dickinson College originated as a grammar school that had been founded in 1773. At the urging of physician and political leader Benjamin Rush, it was chartered as a college in 1783 and was named for then-governor of Pennsylvania John Dickinson. Benjamin Latrobe, architect of the original U.S. Capitol in Washington D.C., designed the school’s first permanent building (completed 1804). Two of the nation’s oldest continuous literary societies, Belles Lettres (founded 1786) and Union Philosophical (1789), were founded at Dickinson. The college began admitting women in 1884. Notable alumni include Roger Brooke Taney, chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court (1836–64), and James Buchanan, 15th president of the United States.
