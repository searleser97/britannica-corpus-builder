Its buildings, which range in style from Gothic to modern, include the Davis Museum and Cultural Center (1993), designed by Rafael Moneo, and Jewett Arts Center (1955–58), designed by Paul Rudolph. Art historian Alice Van Vechten Brown taught at Wellesley, as did geographer Ellen Churchill Semple, archaeologist Esther Boise Van Deman, and Spanish poets Carlos Bousoño, Jorge Guillén, and Pedro Salinas y Serrano.
