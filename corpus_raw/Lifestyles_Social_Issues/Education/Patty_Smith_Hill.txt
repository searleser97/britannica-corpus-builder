Patty Smith Hill,  (born March 27, 1868, Anchorage, Kentucky, U.S.—died May 25, 1946, New York City, New York), U.S. educator who introduced the progressive philosophy to kindergarten teaching, stressing the importance of the creativity and natural instincts of children and reforming the more structured programs of Friedrich Froebel.
Hill began her kindergarten work as a teacher and then became director of the Louisville Free Kindergarten Association in Kentucky in 1893. In 1906 she was appointed to the faculty of Columbia University Teachers College, where she taught for the next 30 years. There she developed a curriculum that emphasized the importance of a child’s firsthand contact with nature for creative expression.
Hill developed the large “Patty Hill blocks,” big sets of blocks widely used in kindergartens. In 1924 Hill helped to found the Institute of Child Welfare Research at Columbia and also promoted the extension of nursery schools through her work with the National Association for Nursery Education, which she helped to organize in 1925. In 1908 she was elected president of the International Kindergarten Union.
She wrote the introduction for A Conduct Curriculum for the Kindergarten and First Grade (1923), a volume in the childhood-education series she edited. Hill also cowrote Song Stories for the Kindergarten (1893) with her sister, Mildred J. Hill. The collection includes “Good Morning to All,” which later became the melody for “Happy Birthday to You.”
