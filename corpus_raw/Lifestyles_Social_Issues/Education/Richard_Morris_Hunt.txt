Richard Morris Hunt,  (born October 31, 1827, Brattleboro, Vermont, U.S.—died July 31, 1895, Newport, Rhode Island), architect who established in the United States the manner and traditions of the French Beaux-Arts (Second Empire) style. He was instrumental in establishing standards for professional architecture and building in the United States; he took a prominent part in the founding of the American Institute of Architects and from 1888 to 1891 was its third president. His eclectic work was almost equally successful in the ornate style of the early Renaissance in France, the picturesque villa style, and the monumental Classical style of the Lenox Library.
Hunt studied in Europe (1843–54), mainly at the École des Beaux-Arts (“School of Fine Arts”) in Paris, where he was the first American to be trained. In 1854 he was appointed inspector of works on the buildings connecting the Tuileries with the Louvre. Under Hector Lefuel he designed the Pavillon de la Bibliothèque (“Library Pavilion”), opposite the Palais-Royal.
In 1855 Hunt returned to New York and was employed on the extension of the Capitol in Washington, D.C. He designed the Lenox Library (1870–77; destroyed), the Tribune Building (1873–76), and the facade of the Metropolitan Museum of Art (1894–1902) in New York City; the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor; the theological library and the Marquand Chapel at Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey; the Divinity College and the Scroll and Key Club at Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut; the Vanderbilt Mausoleum on Staten Island, New York City; and the Yorktown Monument in Yorktown, Virginia. For the administration building at the World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893, Hunt received the gold medal of the Royal Institute of British Architects.
Among the most noteworthy of his domestic buildings were the residences of W.K. Vanderbilt (1879–82; destroyed), J.J. Astor (1891–95; destroyed), and Henry G. Marquand (1881–84; destroyed) in New York City; George W. Vanderbilt’s country house at Biltmore, North Carolina, near Asheville (1888–95; the largest American house ever built); and several of the large opulent summer houses in Newport, Rhode Island, including Marble House (1888–92) and The Breakers (1892–95).
