Robert Balfour, Latin Robertus Balforeus,  (born 1550?, Forfarshire [now Angus], Scotland—died after 1625), philosopher accomplished in Latin and Greek who spent his career teaching these languages in France.
Balfour was educated at the University of St. Andrews. When the Reformation gained momentum in Scotland, he, a Roman Catholic, left for France. There he taught at the University of Paris and the Collège de Guyenne at Bordeaux and was soon recognized as a brilliant teacher of the classics. He also published editions of certain important works, including Gelasius of Cyzicus’s work on the Council of Nicaea (1599), Theodore of Rhaithu’s treatise on the incarnation (1599), and Cleomedes’ Meteora (1605).
