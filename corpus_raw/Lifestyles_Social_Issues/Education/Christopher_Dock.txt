Christopher Dock,  (born 1698?, Germany—died  1771, Skippack, Montgomery county, Pa. [U.S.]), Mennonite schoolmaster in colonial Pennsylvania whose teaching methods gave rise to publication of the first known book dealing with education in America.
Drawn from Germany to Pennsylvania by the religious freedom accorded Mennonites, Dock opened a school at Skippack about the year 1718, and—with the exception of the interval from 1728 to 1738, during which he devoted himself to farming—he taught there and at a second school in Salford for the rest of his life.
Pious and humble, Dock in 1750 reluctantly wrote a description of his teaching methods. Originally intended for posthumous publication, his manuscript, Schulordnung (“School Management”), was published in 1770, a year before his death. The volume proved very influential and went into a second edition the same year; it was republished as late as 1861 in German, and it continued to be published in English well into the 20th century.
Dock advocated gentleness and encouragement in the teacher-student relationship. He counseled that discipline should grow from love, and he encouraged teachers to be simple, direct, and understanding, rather than harsh and overbearing. He prayed each evening that he might be forgiven for any injustices or neglect he might have committed that day. In that posture he died and was found the next morning in the schoolhouse.
In addition to his book, Dock also wrote a children’s rule book, A Hundred Rules of Conduct for Children (c. 1750), and a number of Mennonite hymns.
