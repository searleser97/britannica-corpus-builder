Fulbright scholarship,  educational grant under an international exchange scholarship program created to increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States and the people of other countries through the medium of educational and cultural exchange. The program was conceived by Sen. J. William Fulbright of Arkansas and carried forward by the Fulbright Act of 1946. It was subsequently consolidated and expanded in the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961, commonly known as the Fulbright-Hays Act.
The Fulbright program is based on a series of bilateral diplomatic agreements that place ultimate responsibility for operations with the U.S. Department of State. Overseas administration, however, is turned over to educational foundations in which signatory governments and their academic communities participate; some other governments share the programâ€™s costs with the United States.
A candidate for a Fulbright grant must have a Bachelor of Arts degree or its equivalent, be proficient in the language of the country in which he proposes to study, and have general maturity and scholastic competence. Most of the exchanges have been students, but teachers, advanced researchers, trainees, and observers have also qualified. Fulbright grants have funded academic study, research pursuits, artistic projects, and teaching opportunities, especially in language instruction.
