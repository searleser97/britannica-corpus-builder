Bank Street College of Education,  privately supported coeducational teachers college in New York, New York, U.S. It offers graduate courses only, operating a laboratory (elementary) school and conducting basic research in education. Established in 1916 by Lucy Sprague Mitchell, first dean of women at the University of California and a disciple of philosopher and educator John Dewey, the institution was originally called the Bureau of Educational Experiments; it incorporated a nursery school in which child development was studied. In 1930 the bureau opened an elementary school and a teacher-training school at 69 Bank Street, where new curriculums were developed, classroom material was produced, and children’s books were written.
In 1950 the school’s name was changed to the Bank Street College of Education. In 1964 Bank Street helped launch the National Head Start Program for disadvantaged preschool children; beginning in 1965 the school published the Bank Street Readers, an early contribution to multiracial, urban-oriented teaching materials. It acted as a consultant for children’s television and for school and child-care facilities throughout the world and developed mainstreaming programs for handicapped children. Total enrollment in the graduate school is about 900.
