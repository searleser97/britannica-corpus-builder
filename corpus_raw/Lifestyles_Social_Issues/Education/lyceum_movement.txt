Lyceum movement,  early form of organized adult education, of widespread popular appeal in the northeastern and midwestern United States. The first lyceum was founded in 1826 in Millbury, Massachusetts, by Josiah Holbrook, a teacher and lecturer. The lyceum movement, named for the place where Aristotle lectured to the youth of ancient Greece, was led by voluntary local associations that gave people an opportunity to hear debates and lectures on topics of current interest. The American lyceums multiplied rapidly, numbering 3,000 by 1834.
As conceived by Holbrook, each lyceum was to contribute to the spread of learning, especially of the natural sciences. In communities hungry for knowledge, the idea caught fire and soon expanded to include home-talent productions of essays, discussions, debates, and lectures. A major topic in early years was the establishment of public schools.
At first the lyceums were local ventures with speakers supplied by the community, but by 1840 they had become professionalized institutions with outside lecturers to whom fees were paid. Among the well-known speakers who traveled from state to state were Ralph Waldo Emerson, Frederick Douglass, Henry David Thoreau, Daniel Webster, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Susan B. Anthony. Many of Emersonâ€™s essays were originally written as lyceum lectures.
Lyceums flourished up to the American Civil War and thereafter blended indistinguishably into the chautauqua movement, which had begun in the 1870s. In their heyday the American lyceums contributed to the broadening of school curricula and the development of local museums and libraries in the United States.
