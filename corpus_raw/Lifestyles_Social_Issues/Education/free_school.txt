Free school, also called Informal School, or Open Classroom,  school in which the teaching system is based on an environment structured to encourage the child to become actively involved in the learning process. The free school stresses individualized rather than group instruction, and children proceed from one step to another at their own rate of development. The school day is not divided into rigid timetables as in a traditional classroom. At the teacherâ€™s discretion and under his guidance, children are engaged individually or in small groups in a wide variety of activities for longer periods of time than the usual class meeting. Talking and moving about are not forbidden; in fact, physical activity and conversation are necessary to this type of learning.
In Great Britain the method has become common since the end of World War II. It is also widely used in the United States, where such schooling is known as open classroom.
