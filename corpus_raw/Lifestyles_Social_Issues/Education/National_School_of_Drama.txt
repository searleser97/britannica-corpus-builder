National School of Drama (NSD),  educational institution in New Delhi founded in 1959 for the study of theatre and providing training in acting, stagecraft, and related subjects. It is considered the foremost school of its kind in India.
The NSD was established under the aegis of the Sangeet Natak Akademi (India’s national academy of music, dance, and drama). Under the direction (1962–77) of Ebrahim Alkazi, the school emerged as India’s premier theatre-training institute. It became administratively autonomous in 1975, although it continued to be fully funded by the Indian government.
In addition to its training program, the NSD engaged with the public through such entities as the Repertory Company (formed 1964), which mounted various professional stage productions, and the Theatre in Education Company (1989), which promoted children’s theatre through performances and workshops. Throughout its existence, the NSD has contributed significantly to the realm of Indian performing arts. Notable alumni include the actors Anupam Kher, Om Puri, Naseeruddin Shah, and Anil Kapoor.
