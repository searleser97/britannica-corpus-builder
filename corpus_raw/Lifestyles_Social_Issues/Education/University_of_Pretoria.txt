University of Pretoria, Afrikaans Universiteit Van Pretoria,  state-supported coeducational institution of higher learning at Pretoria, South Africa. It was founded in 1908, when the arts and science courses of Transvaal University College in Johannesburg were transferred to Pretoria. In 1910 the two institutions were separated, the Johannesburg section being reincorporated as the South African School of Mines and Technology, while the Pretoria section retained the name of Transvaal University College. Originally offering courses in languages, sciences, and law, the college added faculties of agriculture (1917), theology (1918), economics and political science (1919), veterinary science (1920), and music (1923). In 1930 it assumed the name of University of Pretoria, subsequently establishing faculties of education, medicine, dentistry, and engineering. The languages of instruction are Afrikaans and English.
