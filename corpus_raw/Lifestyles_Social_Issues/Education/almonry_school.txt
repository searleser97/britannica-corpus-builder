Almonry school,   medieval English monastic charity school supported by a portion of the funds allocated to the almoner (q.v.). The practice began in the early 14th century when a form of scholarship was established that provided attendance at the cathedral school, housing, and food for boys at least 10 years old who could sing and read. They sang in the cathedral choir and acted as page boys to the monks. Their teachers were the secular clerks of the monastery. Such schools have now largely disappeared, although a few survived into the 20th century.
