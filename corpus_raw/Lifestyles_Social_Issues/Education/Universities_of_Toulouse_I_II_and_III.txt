Universities of Toulouse I, II, and III, French Universit√©s De Toulouse I, Ii, Et Iii,  three autonomous coeducational state institutions of higher learning founded at Toulouse, Fr., in 1970 under the 1968 law reforming higher education, to replace the former University of Toulouse founded in 1229: the University of Social Sciences, specializing in law and economics; the University of Toulouse-le-Mirail, a liberal arts institution; and the University Paul-Sabatier, specializing in science and technology, including medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, and engineering.
The University of Toulouse had its origins in a Dominican school set up to combat heresy in the early 13th century, and reinforced by migrations of scholars from the University of Paris after Pope Honorius III forbade the study of Roman law at Paris in 1219. Its founding as a university 10 years later, by Pope Gregory IX (the first founding of a university by a pope), followed the peace treaty ending the war against the Albigensians. After a struggle to shake off its reputation as an instrument for repression and persecution, the university gradually attained distinction as a law school.
Suppressed by the French Revolution, it was replaced by separate faculties of law, theology, science, and letters; a medical faculty was added in 1808, and the faculties were reconstituted as a university in 1896.
