Oaxaca, in full Oaxaca de Juárez,  city, capital of Oaxaca estado (state), southern Mexico, lying in the fertile Oaxaca Valley, 5,085 feet (1,550 metres) above sea level. The city site, which has been inhabited for thousands of years, was important to numerous pre-Columbian civilizations, as evidenced by the Zapotec ruins at Monte Albán, lying adjacent to Oaxaca, and the nearby Mixtec ruins at Mitla. Occupied by the Aztecs from the 15th century, Oaxaca subsequently was conquered by the Spaniards and officially designated a city by Hernán Cortés in 1529. Some of the city’s 16th-century art and architecture still survives, most notably in the Church of Santo Domingo, which includes Indian influences. Oaxaca’s large Indian population continues to leave its imprint on the city’s traditional festivals, colourful handicraft markets, and daily life.
Oaxaca was the home of two of Mexico’s most famous presidents, Porfirio Díaz and Benito Juárez (a Zapotec from the nearby village of Guelatao). The Benito Juárez Autonomous University of Oaxaca was founded there in 1827 (university status 1955), and the Regional Museum of Oaxaca (1933) exhibits the world-renowned treasures from Tomb No. 7 at Monte Albán. The colonial centre of Oaxaca and the Monte Albán archaeological zone were collectively designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1987.
The city’s economy is based largely on services, including education, government administration, and tourism associated with the pre-Columbian remains. Light manufactures include construction materials, processed foods, and beverages. Oaxaca is accessible by highway, railroad, and air. Pop. (2000) 251,846; metro. area, 489,562; (2010) 255,029; metro. area, 593,698.
