Tutub,   modern Khafājī, ancient Sumerian city-state located in the Diyālā Valley east of Baghdad, Iraq. Tutub was of greatest significance during the Early Dynastic Period (c. 2900–2334 bc), and important remains have been found dating to that period—particularly the temple oval. Tutub was excavated between 1930 and 1938 by investigators from the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago.
