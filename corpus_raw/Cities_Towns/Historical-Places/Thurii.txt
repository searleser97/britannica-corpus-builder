Thurii, also called Thuria, or Thurium,  ancient Greek city of southern Italy, near the mouth of the Crathis River, in the province of Cosenza. After Sybaris was destroyed by Croton (448 bce), its citizens founded a new Sybaris with Athenian aid; the Athenians subsequently expelled the Sybarites, repopulated the city with colonists from Greece, and renamed the city Thurii after a nearby spring (443). Thurii flourished until after a severe defeat by the Lucanians (390â€“389), when it turned to Rome for help and accepted a Roman garrison. A Latin colony was founded at Thurii in 193: first known as Copia, it later reassumed the name of Thurii. Excavations begun in 1960 disclosed Greek and Roman remains.
