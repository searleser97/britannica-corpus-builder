Stokesay,  village (“parish”), administrative and historic county of Shropshire, Eng., best known for its castle (1240), one of the most notable fortified manor houses of England. It was fortified against Welsh marauders, and the south tower was added by the Ludlows, a landowning family who purchased the castle in 1291. In the 16th century a half-timbered gatehouse replaced the ancient entrance tower.
