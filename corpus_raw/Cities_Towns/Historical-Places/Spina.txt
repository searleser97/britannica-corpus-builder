Spina,   ancient Etruscan port on the Adriatic coast of Italy, now about 6 miles (10 km) inland. Spina was founded at the mouth of the Po River toward the end of the 6th century bc and was one of two main ports of entry for the rich Greek commerce with northern Etruria. Soon after 400 bc Spina was sacked by the Gauls, and, with the collapse of its market and the silting of its port, it rapidly lapsed into obscurity.
Excavations since 1922 in the cemeteries of Valle Trebba and of Valle Pega have yielded many fine bronzes and an unrivaled collection of Greek pottery.
