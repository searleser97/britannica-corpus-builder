Zacatecas,  city, capital of Zacatecas estado (state), north-central Mexico. Located in the southern part of the state, it lies in a deep narrow ravine, about 8,200 feet (2,500 metres) above sea level. The city’s name means "place where zacate grass grows."
The historic centre of Zacatecas was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1993. The cathedral, noted for its highly carved portico, was begun in 1612 and completed in the mid-1700s. It contained European paintings and elaborate silverwork and goldwork until the 1850s and ’60s, when most of them were confiscated by reformists. The extensive pre-Columbian ruins of La Quemada (Chicomóztoc) are about 30 miles (50 km) south-southwest of the city.
The site of the present-day city had long been an indigenous mining centre when a Spanish town was founded there in 1548 by Juan de Tolosa, Cristóbal de Oñate, Diego de Ibarra, and Baltasar Tremiño. It was designated a city in 1585, two years after silver was discovered in the area by Spaniards. During the  colonial era the mines around Zacatecas yielded as much as one-fifth of the world’s silver production. Mining is still important, and the city is also a commercial and manufacturing centre for an agricultural hinterland that produces wheat, corn (maize), and livestock. Among its light manufactures are motor vehicle components and clothing. Zacatecas has an airport and is linked by highway and railroad with Ciudad Juárez and Mexico City.  Pop.
