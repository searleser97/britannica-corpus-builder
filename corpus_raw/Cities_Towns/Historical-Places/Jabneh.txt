Jabneh, (Hebrew: “God Builds”) Greek Jamnia, modern Yibna, also called Yavne,  ancient city of Palestine (now Israel) lying about 15 miles (24 km) south of Tel Aviv–Yafo and 4 miles (6 km) from the Mediterranean Sea. Settled by Philistines, Jabneh came into Jewish hands in the time of Uzziah in the 8th century bc. Judas Maccabeus (d. 161 bc) attacked the harbour of Jabneh in his anger at the inhabitants’ hostility. On the destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem by the Romans in ad 70, the academy of Jabneh—established by Johanan ben Zakkai—became one of the most important centres of Jewish learning. At a meeting of rabbis held there about ad 100, the final canon of the Hebrew Bible was fixed. The crusaders built a fortress there in the 12th century.
