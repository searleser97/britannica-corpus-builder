Olinda,  city, eastern Pernambuco estado (state), northeastern Brazil. It is located atop a low hill on the Atlantic coast, immediately north of Recife, the state capital.
Olinda was founded by the Portuguese Duarte Coelho Pereira as the colonial capital of Pernambuco captaincy in 1537. By 1600 its economy was based on sugar, and imported African slave labour had made it a feudal and ecclesiastical stronghold; slavery was abolished in 1888. In 1630 the Dutch captured the city, occupying it until 1654. By that time it had declined, its place of leadership being passed to Recife, which became the capital.
Olinda now houses much of the suburban population of the Greater Recife metropolitan area. It, rather than Recife, is the seat of a Roman Catholic bishopric. The city is home to a large colony of artists who produce wood carvings and pottery. The city centre of Olinda is noted for its 16th- and 17th-century ornate churches and monasteries and for other colonial buildings; the area was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1982. Pop. (2010) 377,779.
