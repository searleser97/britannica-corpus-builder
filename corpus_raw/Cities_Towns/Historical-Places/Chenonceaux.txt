Chenonceaux,  village, Indre-et-Loire département, Centre région, west-central France, on the right bank of the Cher River. Chenonceaux is famous for its château, which bridges the Cher. Founded on the pilings of a mill in 1513 or 1515 by Thomas Bohier, financial minister in Normandy, the château was completed in 1522 and represents a type of architecture transitional between Gothic and Renaissance. An isolated tower flanking a drawbridge is part of an earlier building of the 15th century. The château was confiscated by Francis I in 1535. Henry II presented it to his mistress Diane de Poitiers, who on his death was forced by his queen, Catherine de Médicis, to exchange it for Chaumont-sur-Loire. Catherine built the gallery that leads to the left bank of the Cher. Son et lumière (French: “sound and light”) displays, using varicoloured lights and historical sound track, are now produced at the château. Chenonceaux was extensively restored in the 19th century. The village was occupied by the Germans and slightly damaged in World War II. It lies amid a region of viticulture. Pop. (1999) 325; (2014 prelim.) 355.
