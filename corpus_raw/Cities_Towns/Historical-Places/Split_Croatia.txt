Split, Italian Spalato,  seaport, resort, and chief city of Dalmatia, southern Croatia. It is situated on a peninsula in the Adriatic Sea with a deep, sheltered harbour on the south side.
A major commercial and transportation centre, the city is best known for the ruins of the Palace of Diocletian (built 295–305 ce). Collectively with the historic royal residences, fortifications, and churches in the city, the palace was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1979. Pop. (2001) 188,694; (2011) 167,121.
From 812 Split developed as a major Byzantine city. In 1105, after brief incursions by Venice (998) and Croatia (1069), the city acknowledged the nominal suzerainty of Hungary-Croatia and fought sporadically with its rival Trogir; from 1420 to 1797 it was held by Venice. The Austrians ruled from 1797 to 1918 with a brief French interregnum in 1808–13. Split became part of Yugoslavia in 1918 and of independent Croatia in 1992.
The growth of the port facilities dates from the temporary loss of Rijeka (Fiume) to Italy in 1924 (recovered 1945). During World War II those facilities were wrecked by the Germans and by Allied bombing, but the old town was little damaged, and repairs were subsequently made. In 1995 the city celebrated the 1,700th anniversary of the initiation of construction of the Roman palace.
Built within the palace is the nucleus of the “old town.” The immense complex has walls 7 feet (2 metres) thick and 72 feet (22 metres) high on its seaward side and 60 feet (18 metres) high on the northern side. Originally it had 16 towers (of which 3 remain) and 4 gates. A tree-lined promenade now keeps the Adriatic from lapping against the south walls as it once did. The palace was damaged by the Avars, who sacked nearby Solin (Salona) about 614; its inhabitants first fled to the islands but then returned to seek refuge in the palace (c. 620), calling the settlement Spalatum. They built their homes within the seven-acre (three-hectare) palace compound, incorporating its walls and pillars.
The area within the walls of the palace has been continuously inhabited since it was built. It contains buildings and embellishments of medieval, Renaissance, and Baroque periods, as well as fine examples of Roman architecture. Efforts have been made not only to excavate further the Roman remains and identify and elucidate remains of the early medieval period but also to preserve the eclectic architecture of the complex. The palace is still thought of by the inhabitants of Split as the city centre and not a museum: The cathedral and baptistery are in use, the peristyle court is a popular meeting place, shops occupy the Roman arcades, and the main market is just outside the east gate of the palace. Tourists can see architectural remains of all periods from Roman times onward while walking under the laundry lines of the modern citizens.
Split has a university (1974) and an oceanographic institute. Museums include the Meštrović Gallery (opened 1952), devoted to the works of the Croatian sculptor Ivan Meštrović; the Archaeological Museum (founded 1820), housing artifacts from the ruins of Solin and other nearby sites; the Museum of Croatian Archaeological Monuments (1893, in Knin), which has notable exhibits on the Early Middle Ages; the City Museum (1946); the Art Gallery (1931); and the Ethnographic Museum (1910), which is housed in the Venetian Gothic town hall. The Croatian National Theatre, built from 1891 to 1893, was gutted by fire in 1971 but reconstructed by 1979. The belfry (c. 1100) of Our Lady of the Belfry church is the oldest in Dalmatia.
The city’s harbour and port, combined with its central position on the Adriatic coast and its good rail and road connections to the northern parts of the country, have made it important commercially. There is a large shipyard, and plastics, chemicals, aluminum, and cement are produced. Several island ferries depart from Split, and the city has an international airport.
