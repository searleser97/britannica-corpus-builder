Bubastis, modern Tall Basṭah,  ancient Egyptian city in the Nile River delta north of Cairo. It became important when the pharaohs of the 19th dynasty (1292–1190 bce) moved their capital from Thebes to the delta, and it reached its peak of prosperity when its prince, Sheshonk I (the biblical Shishak, reigned 945–924 bce), became pharaoh. The city’s god was the cat-headed Bastet, whose festival was among the most revelrous in Egypt.
