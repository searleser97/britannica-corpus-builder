El Paraíso, also called Chuquitanta,  Late Preceramic site in the present-day Chillón Valley on the central Peruvian coast, generally believed to date just before the beginning of the Initial Period (c. 2100–1800 bc). It is notable for its large mud and rock apartment-like dwelling units. It is believed to be roughly contemporaneous with the Preceramic Period structures of Kotosh, in the Peruvian highlands. El Paraíso buildings show a similar level of population density and architectural sophistication. The inhabitants of El Paraíso presumably depended upon both fishing and plant cultivation (probably not including corn [maize]) for their subsistence.
