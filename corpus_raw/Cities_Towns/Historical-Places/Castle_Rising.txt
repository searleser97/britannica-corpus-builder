Castle Rising,  village (“parish”), King’s Lynn and West Norfolk borough, administrative and historic county of Norfolk, England. A great Norman castle with a massive square keep stands within a 12-acre (5-hectare) enclosure formed by artificial ramparts of earth and a ditch, which is crossed by an ancient bridge. The incorporated town that grew in its shelter in the Middle Ages, with important fairs and markets, later decayed and was disfranchised in 1832; it is now a mere village with a late Norman church.
