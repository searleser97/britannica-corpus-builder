Daphnae, also spelled Daphnai, biblical Tahpanhes, modern Tall al-Dafana,  ancient fortress town (Fortress of Penhase), situated near Qaná¹­arah in northeastern Egypt. Excavations by Sir Flinders Petrie in 1886 uncovered a massive fort and enclosure surrounded by a wall 40 feet (12 metres) thick, built by Psamtik I in the 7th century bce. A garrison of mercenaries, mostly Carians and Ionian Greeks, was established in the fort. After the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem (587 bce), many Jewish fugitives, including the prophet Jeremiah, fled to Tahpanhes. Its decline began in the 6th century bce when Amasis gave Naukratis the monopoly of Greek trade.
