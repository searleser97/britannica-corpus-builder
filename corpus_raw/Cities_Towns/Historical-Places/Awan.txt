Awan,   ancient city and region of the land of Elam, prominent throughout early Mesopotamian history and especially in the second half of the 3rd millennium bc. Although it was probably situated near Susa, in southwestern Iran, Awan’s exact location is unknown. A coalition of four rulers of southwestern Persia, led by the king of Awan, provided vigorous resistance to the eastern campaigns of King Sargon of Akkad (reigned 2334–2279 bc). The coalition was eventually defeated, however, and it was perhaps at that time that the centre of Elamite power was transferred from Awan to Susa.
