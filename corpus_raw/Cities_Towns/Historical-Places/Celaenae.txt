Celaenae,  ancient fortress city of Phrygia (in present Turkey), the starting point of the march of the “Ten Thousand” under Cyrus (401 bc) against Artaxerxes (recounted in Xenophon’s Anabasis). In 333 Celaenae was conquered by Alexander the Great. The city was later renamed Apamea Cibotus (q.v.) by Antiochus I Soter, who refounded it on a more open site in order to benefit from the growing commerce on the great eastern trade route. The site is occupied by the modern town of Dinar, Tur.
