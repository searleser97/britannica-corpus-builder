Bantam,  former city and sultanate of Java, Indonesia. It lay near the site of the present-day city of Banten, on Banten Bay, at the extreme northwest of the island, just north of Serang. Now in ruins, Bantam was the most important port on Java for the spice trade with Europe from the 16th century until the end of the 18th, when its harbour silted up. Its site is now more than 1 mile (1.6 km) from the sea. Ruined buildings include the Pakuwonan palace (1680), Fort Speelwijk, and several mosques, the oldest of which dates from 1562. Under Dutch occupation the sultanate of Bantam was dissolved to become the westernmost residency of Java, comprising the districts of Pandeglang, Serang, and Lebak. In 1950 the residency joined the Republic of Indonesia as part of the province of West Java (Jawa Barat), and in 2000 it became the separate province of Banten.
