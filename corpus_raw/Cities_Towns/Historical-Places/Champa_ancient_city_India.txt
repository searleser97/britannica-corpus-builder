Champa, also spelled Campa,  city of ancient India, the capital of the kingdom of Anga (a region corresponding with the eastern part of present-day Bihar state). It is identified with two villages of that name on the south bank of the Ganges (Ganga) River east of Munger.
Champa is often mentioned in early Buddhist literature as a city of importance and was one of the six great cities of northern India in the Buddha’s time (6th–4th century bce). Several Buddhist remains and ruins have been excavated at Champa. It was a centre for foreign trade, and it gave its name to a kingdom later founded in Annam (now in Vietnam).
