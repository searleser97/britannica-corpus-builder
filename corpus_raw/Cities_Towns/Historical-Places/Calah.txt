Calah, also spelled Kalhu or Kalakh, modern Nimrūd,  ancient Assyrian city situated south of Mosul in northern Iraq. The city was first excavated by A.H. (later Sir Austen) Layard during 1845–51 and afterward principally by M.E.L. (later Sir Max) Mallowan (1949–58).
Founded in the 13th century bce by Shalmaneser I, Calah remained unimportant until King Ashurnasirpal II (reigned 883–859 bce) chose it as his royal seat and the military capital of Assyria. His extensive work on the Acropolis—which covered about 65 acres (26 hectares)—and the outer walled town was completed by his son Shalmaneser III and other monarchs. The most-important religious building, founded in 798 by Queen Sammu-ramat (Semiramis of Greek legend), was Ezida, which included the temple of Nabu (Nebo), god of writing, and his consort Tashmetum (Tashmit). The temple library and an annex contained many religious and magical texts and several “treaties,” including the last will and testament of Esarhaddon (reigned 680–669). In the outer town the most-important building is Fort Shalmaneser, an arsenal that occupied at least 12 acres. This and other buildings have yielded thousands of carved ivories, mostly made in the 9th and 8th centuries bce, now one of the richest collections of ivory in the world.
In the 7th century bce Calah declined in importance because the Sargonids tended to use Nineveh as their residence. Nonetheless, it continued to be extensively occupied until the fall of Nineveh in 612 bce.
In March 2015 a video emerged that appeared to show militants belonging to the extremist Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant destroying artifacts with power tools and then using explosives to level the site. The extent of the damage could not be independently confirmed.
