Yaroslavl,  city and administrative centre of Yaroslavl oblast (region), west-central European Russia. It lies on the right bank of the Volga River, 175 miles (282 km) northeast of Moscow.
Yaroslavl is believed to have been founded in 1010 by Prince Yaroslav I (the Wise), and it served as the capital of an independent principality from 1218 until 1471, when it came under the rule of Moscow. Yaroslavl was sacked by the Tatars in 1238 and by Ivan I Kalita in 1332 and was captured by Novgorod in 1371, but on each occasion its recovery was swift. The opening of trade with the West during the 16th century brought prosperity to the town, which lay at the intersection of the great Volga River and Moscow–Arkhangelsk trade routes. The Yaroslavl Great Manufactory, one of the earliest and largest textile mills in Russia, was established in 1722, and by the late 18th century Yaroslavl had become an important industrial centre.
Yaroslavl’s industries now produce heavy machinery (particularly diesel engines and electrical equipment), refined petroleum products, textiles, and synthetic rubber and tires. Power is produced by coal-burning electric plants and by the Rybinsk and Uglich hydroelectric stations, located upstream on the Volga.
Many fine churches survive in Yaroslavl, including the Transfiguration Cathedral (1505–16) of the Saviour Monastery. The churches of Elijah the Prophet, Nikola Nadein, and St. John the Baptist all date from the 17th century. Yaroslavl has a university, several institutes of higher education, four theatres (including Russia’s first public theatre, founded in 1750), an art gallery, several museums, and a symphony orchestra. Pop. (2010) 591,486; (2014 est.) 602,400.
