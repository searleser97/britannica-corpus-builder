Anazarbus, in full Caesarea ad Anazarbus, modern Aǧaçli, formerly Çeçenanavarza,  former city of the ancient province of Cilicia in Anatolia that was important in the Roman and Byzantine periods. It was located in what is now south-central Turkey. The original native settlement was refounded by the Romans in 19 bc, following a visit by Augustus. It rivaled Tarsus, the Cilician capital, in the 3rd century ad, and under Diocletian became the seat of the separate Roman province of Cilicia Secunda. Anazarbus was an archbishopric under the Byzantine Empire. After its devastation by earthquakes in the 6th century, it was rebuilt, first as Justinopolis, later as Justinianopolis.
Under Muslim occupation it was renamed ʿAyn Zarbah and retained its strategic importance. It was regained for Byzantium by Nicephorus Phocas about 962 and was subsequently devastated during the Crusades. As Anavarza, it became the capital of Cilician Little Armenia early in the 12th century. The Mamlūks of Egypt finally destroyed the city in 1374.
A Byzantine-Armenian castle—the finest medieval monument in Cilicia—stands on the ruins of the site. A Roman triumphal arch, a theatre, stadium, amphitheatre, aqueducts, and the remnants of several Byzantine churches are also preserved.
