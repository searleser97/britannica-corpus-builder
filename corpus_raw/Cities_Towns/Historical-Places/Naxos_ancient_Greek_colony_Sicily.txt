Naxos,  the earliest Greek colony in Sicily, founded by Chalcidians under Theocles (or Thucles) about 734 bc. It lay on the east coast, south of Tauromenium (modern Taormina), just north of the mouth of the Alcantara River, on what is now Cape Schis√≤. Although there were already native Sicels at Tauromenium, they cannot have offered much opposition. The adoption of the name of Naxos, after the island in the Aegean Sea, may show that there were Naxians among its founders. It soon founded other colonies at Leontini and Catana, which became far more important. After 461 bc Naxos was in opposition to Syracuse, allied with Leontini (427) and Athens (415). In 403 it was destroyed by Dionysius I, tyrant of Syracuse, and its territory given to the Sicels. Its Greek exiles at last found refuge in 358 at Tauromenium. Scanty traces of its walls are to be seen.
