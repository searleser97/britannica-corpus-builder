Soli,   ancient Anatolian seaport located west of modern Mersin, in south-central Turkey.
Soli was founded by Greek colonists from Rhodes and was so prosperous when taken by Alexander the Great in 333 bc that he was able to exact from it a fine of 200 talents for its attachment to Persia. The city was destroyed and depopulated by Tigranes II of Armenia (reigned 95–55 bc) but was later revived by the Roman general Pompey, who settled defeated Cilician pirates there and renamed it Pompeiopolis. The bad Greek that was spoken there gave origin to the term solecism (Greek: soloikismos). Remains of the port’s artificial harbour can be traced in the form of two parallel moles with curving ends, but the most striking remains are the relics of a long colonnade that flanked Soli’s main highway, leading to the harbour.
