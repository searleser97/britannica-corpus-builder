Manyakheta, modern Malkhaid, also spelled Malkhed,  site of a former city in Karnataka, India, about 85 miles (135 km) southwest of Hyderabad. The city was founded in the 9th century by the Rashtrakuta ruler Amoghavarsha I and became the capital of the dynasty.
In 972 it was sacked by the Paramara ruler Siyaka. After the downfall of the dynasty in the following year, it was taken by the Chalukyas, who adopted it for some time as their capital. Thereafter it never regained its former glory and dwindled to the status of a village.
