Guanajuato,  city, capital of Guanajuato estado (state), central Mexico. Situated on the Mesa Central, it is spread over steep hillsides at the junction of three ravines at an average elevation of about 6,725 feet (2,050 metres) above sea level.
Guanajuato was founded in 1554 and given city status in 1741. Along with Zacatecas, to the north, and Potosí, Bolivia, the town became one of the three greatest silver-mining centres of the 16th century. Its celebrated Veta Madre (“Mother Lode”) was described as the richest in the world. The fabulous wealth was most manifest in the elaborate and richly endowed churches of San Francisco (1671) and San Diego (1663). Guanajuato’s historic city centre and nearby colonial-era mines—including a shaft some 2,000 feet (600 metres) deep known as the Boca del Infierno (“Mouth of Hell”)—were collectively designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1988.
Guanajuato was the first major city to fall to the independence leader Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla in 1810. The plundering and destruction that accompanied the overrunning of the Alhóndiga de Granaditas (a granary used as a fortress; now the state historical museum) were followed by struggles for control of the city. By 1822  mineral output had slowed because of violence, floods, and the  exodus of many wealthy families. Guanajuato entered a period of decline that continued until the mid-20th century, when increased tourism and federal support for mining began to increase. Yet it has remained overshadowed by the state’s larger cities, notably León with more than 10 times the capital’s population.
In addition to its government functions, Guanajuato is a market and service centre for nearby mines (gold, silver, lead, and other minerals) and farms and ranches. The city is accessible by highway and is served by an airport at León. The state University of Guanajuato (1732; present name 1945) forms the core of the city’s annual Cervantes festival. An unusual attraction is a museum containing dozens of mummified corpses exhumed from a nearby cemetery. Pop. (2000) 74,874; (2010) 72,237.
