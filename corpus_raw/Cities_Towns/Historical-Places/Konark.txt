Konark, also spelled Konarak, Konarka, or Kanarak,  historic town, east-central Odisha state, eastern India, on the Bay of Bengal coast. It is famous for its 13th-century Surya Deula (or Surya Deul), popularly known as the Sun Temple.
The town’s name is derived from the Sanskrit words kona (“corner”) and arka (“sun”), a reference to the temple, which was dedicated to the Hindu sun god Surya. It was designed to represent his chariot, with 12 huge carved stone wheels and 7 stone horses around its base. The Surya Deula is about 100 feet (30 metres) high and would have surpassed 200 feet (60 metres) in height at its completion. The exterior is covered with sculptured decorations, many depicting erotic scenes.
The town and the temple are associated with the legend of Samba, the son of the Hindu deity Krishna, who was cured of leprosy by the sun god’s blessings. Evidence suggests that the temple was built by Narasimha I (reigned 1238–64) about 1250. It represents the culmination of the Orissan school of temple architecture. Formerly called the Black Pagoda because of the many shipwrecks that occurred off the coast, the temple was used as a navigation landmark by European mariners sailing to Calcutta (now Kolkata). From the 15th to the 17th century, the temple was sacked various times by Muslim armies. By the 19th century, much of the temple had been weathered and ruined. Under British rule, sections of the temple complex were restored, but much of it remained in ruins. The complex was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1984.
About 6 miles (10 km) from the town is Ramchandi Temple on Ramchandi beach, on the bank of the Kushabhadra River, which empties into the Bay of Bengal. In general, the beaches at Konark and beyond are famous for their festivals. Pop. (2001) 15,013; (2011) 16,779.
