Alba Fucens, present-day Albe,  ancient fortified hilltop town of the Aequi in central Italy. It was settled by Rome as a Latin colony in 303 bc and was important for its domination of the Via Valeria, which linked Rome with the Adriatic Sea. Alba Fucens was situated on a hill with three distinct summits, all of which were enclosed within the city walls. Its strong position made it important in the Social War and in the civil wars of the 1st century bc. Captured kings were often interned there.
Much survives of the main circuit of walls, and excavation has revealed the whole of the town centre. The gateways, which survive, were so placed as to expose the right, or unprotected, side of an attacking force. An elevated area in a northern corner had a separate line of walls.
