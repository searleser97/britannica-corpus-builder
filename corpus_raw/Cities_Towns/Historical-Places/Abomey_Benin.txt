Abomey,  town, southern Benin. It is located about 60 miles (100 km) north of Cotonou.
Probably founded in the early 17th century, it soon became the capital of the kingdom of Abomey (later Dahomey; the country’s previous name), which dominated production and trade with the European enterprises on the Slave Coast until the late 19th century. The town is located in an area where palm nuts and peanuts (groundnuts) are grown; it is connected by road and rail to Cotonou, the country’s main commercial centre, and to Porto-Novo, the capital. The royal palaces, the tombs of the kings, and a historical museum are maintained in Abomey; the royal palaces were designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1985. Tourism is a significant factor in the town’s economy. Pop. (2002) Abomey-Calavi, 61,450; (2013 prelim.) Abomey-Calavi, 135,000.
