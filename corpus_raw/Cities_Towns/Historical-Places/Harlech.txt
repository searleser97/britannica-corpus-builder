Harlech,  castle and village, Gwynedd county, historic county of Merioneth (Meirionnydd), northwestern Wales. It lies on the coast of Cardigan Bay within the western edge of Snowdonia National Park.
In 1283, after defeating Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, the English king Edward I began construction of a fortress there on the edge of a prominent cliff. That castle has had a long history of occupation and assault. In the early 15th century rebel Welsh leader Owain Glyn Dŵr captured it and held a parliament there. During the Wars of the Roses the English queen Margaret took refuge there in 1460, when Henry VI, her husband, had been captured, and Harlech Castle was the last Welsh fortress to surrender to the Yorkists in 1468 (its defense is commemorated in the battle song “March of the Men of Harlech”). In 1647 it was the last Welsh fortress that surrendered to the Parliamentary armies in the English Civil Wars.
The castle, now an imposing ruin, once sheltered a small borough. In 1986 it and other fortifications built in northern Wales by Edward I were collectively designated a UNESCO World Heritage site. Today Harlech is a resort village with magnificent beach-and-dune scenery, the Royal St. David’s Golf Club, the nature reserve of Morfa Harlech, and access to the mountains of Snowdonia National Park. It also has a long-established residential adult-education college, Coleg Harlech. Pop. (2001) 1,406; (2011) 1,447.
