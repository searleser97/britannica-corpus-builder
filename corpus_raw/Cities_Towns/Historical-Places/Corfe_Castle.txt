Corfe Castle,  parish and castle, Purbeck district, county of Dorset, England. The medieval castle, commanding a gap in the Purbeck chalk ridge, is now an imposing ruin. It was built for King William I (reigned 1066–87) and was royal property until Queen Elizabeth I sold it in 1572. The original structure was a Norman tower-and-keep design, extended later along the lines established in the late 12th century at Château Gaillard. Kings John (1199–1216) and Henry III (1216–72) spent time there and added extensively to the residence and the defenses. During the English Civil Wars it was dismantled by parliamentary forces (1646). The stone-built settlement that grew in its shelter was once a corporate borough and centre of the local quarrying of Purbeck marble, widely used in the 14th century for shrines and tombs. It is now a tourist centre. Pop. (2001) 1,429.
