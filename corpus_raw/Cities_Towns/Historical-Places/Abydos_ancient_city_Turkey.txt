Abydos,   ancient Anatolian town located just northeast of the modern Turkish town of Ã‡anakkale on the east side of the Dardanelles (Hellespont). Probably originally a Thracian town, it was colonized about 670 bc by the Milesians. There Xerxes crossed the strait on his bridge of boats to invade Greece in 480 bc. Abydos is celebrated for its vigorous resistance to Philip V of Macedon (200 bc) and for the legend of Hero and Leander. It survived until late Byzantine times as the toll station of the Hellespont.
