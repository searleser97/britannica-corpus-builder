Gibeah, modern Tall al-Fūl,  ancient town of the Israelite tribe of Benjamin, located just north of Jerusalem. The site, severely denuded by wind and rain, was partly excavated by William F. Albright in 1922 and 1933. A summit fortress had originally been built in the Middle Bronze Age (c. 2000–1550 bc) and was reconstructed in the 12th–11th centuries bc. It was finally replaced by an imposing citadel during the time of King Saul (10th century bc) when it served as the first “royal” residence of Israel. Later becoming insignificant, it was finally destroyed at the time of the first Jewish revolt, ad 70.
