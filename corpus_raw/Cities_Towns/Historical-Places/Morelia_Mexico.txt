Morelia,  city, capital of Michoacán estado (state), west-central Mexico. It lies between the Chiquito and Grande rivers at the southern extreme of the Central Plateau (Mesa Central), at an elevation of about 6,400 feet (1,950 metres). In 1541 the Spanish founded the city on the site of a Tarascan Indian settlement, calling it Valladolid. Valladolid replaced Pátzcuaro as the capital of Michoacán in 1582. It was a major intellectual and cultural centre in the colonial period, stimulated by San Nicolás College, the second oldest institution of higher learning in the Americas (founded in 1540 in Pátzcuaro and moved to Valladolid in 1580; reestablished as Michoacán University of San Nicolás de Hidalgo in 1917). During the Mexican wars for independence, the city served briefly as headquarters for the revolutionary leader Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla. In 1828 the city was renamed Morelia in honour of José María Morelos (y Pavón), a locally born leader of the independence movement.
More than 200 colonial-era buildings stand in the city centre, which was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1991. The cathedral, completed in 1744, is an outstanding example of Spanish Baroque architecture and holds a remarkable 4,600-pipe organ, the focus of an annual organ festival. The colonial governor’s palace is also an imposing structure, as is a 3-mile (5-km) aqueduct, carried on arches and built in 1785.
Morelia has a mixed economy based on light manufacturing (including processed foods, beverages, and construction materials) and services (notably retail trade, government administration, education, and tourism). The city is a market for an array of agricultural products from its hinterland, including corn (maize), beans, fruit, sugarcane, and cattle. The city has rail, highway, and air connections with all major Mexican urban centres. Pop. (2000) 549,996; (2010) 597,511.
