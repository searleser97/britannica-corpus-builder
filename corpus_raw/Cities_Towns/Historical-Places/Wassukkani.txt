Wassukkani,   capital of the Mitannian empire (c. 1500â€“c. 1340 bc), possibly located near the head of the Khabur River in northern Mesopotamia. Wassukkani was for many years the centre of a powerful threat to the Hittite empire, but it was finally plundered about 1355 by the Hittites under Suppiluliumas I, who made a new vassal kingdom of Mitanni. After the death of Suppiluliumas (c. 1336), however, Wassukkani proved to be too weak to resist the Assyrian forces and was soon incorporated into the Assyrian kingdom.
