York Factory,  historical settlement in northeastern Manitoba, Canada. It lies at the mouth of the Hayes River, on Hudson Bay. It was the site of a Hudson’s Bay Company post (Fort Nelson) built in 1683 and destroyed in 1684 by the French; a new fort, named for the duke of York (later King James II), was quickly erected. The fort changed hands several times until by the Treaty of Utrecht (1713) it became British. As York Factory it was the chief port, supply depot, and headquarters for the fur-trading operations of northern Canada. A huge depot building, which still survives, was constructed in 1830. At its height, in the middle of the 19th century, the settlement consisted of 50 buildings, most of which have disappeared. Its importance declined with the transfer of the Northwest Territories to Canada in 1870 and the establishment in 1931 of the transcontinental railroad’s branch line to Churchill on Hudson Bay, 140 miles (225 km) northwest. The Hudson’s Bay Company ceased to use York Factory as its fur-trading headquarters in 1873 and closed it completely in 1957, thus ending 275 years of nearly continuous operation. It became a National Historic Site in 1968. It is accessible only by air or water, which has kept it from becoming a major tourist attraction.
