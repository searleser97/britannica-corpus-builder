Zabīd, also spelled Zebid,  town, western Yemen. It lies on the bank of the Wadi Zabīd and at the eastern fringe of the Tihāmah coastal plain, about 10 miles (16 km) from the Red Sea coast. An ancient Yemeni centre, Zabīd was refounded in ad 820 by the ʿAbbāsids under Muḥammad ibn Ziyād, emissary of the caliph al-Maʾmūn. From there the Ziyādi dynasty, his successors, ruled over large parts of southwestern Arabia. Upon the conquest of Yemen by the Ayyūbids under Tūrān Shāh, brother of Saladin, in 1173–74, the capital was moved to Taʿizz. The city flourished again under the Ṭāhirid dynasty (late 15th century). It was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1993, although in 2000 UNESCO placed the city on a list of sites in danger because many of its old buildings had deteriorated.
A thick wall surrounds Zabīd. Its Great Mosque, once the site of a well-known Shāfiʿī madrasah, is prominent. Zabīd was formerly important as a weaving and dyeing centre (cotton, indigo) and for tanneries and leatherwork. Pop. (2004) 21,576.
