The city was the scene of the decisive defeat of Nabonidus, last king of Babylon, by Cyrus of Persia in 539 bce. It was also the site of a conflict in 324 bce between Alexander the Great and his Macedonian troops, who were threatened by his efforts to incorporate Persians on equal terms in the army.
