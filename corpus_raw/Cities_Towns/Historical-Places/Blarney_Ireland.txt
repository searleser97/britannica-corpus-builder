Blarney, Irish An Bhlarna,  village, County Cork, Ireland, 5 miles (8 km) northwest of Cork city, famous for Blarney Castle (c. 1446). Below the battlements on the southern wall of the castle is the Blarney Stone, reputed to confer eloquence on those who kiss it; this feat can be achieved only by hanging head downward. “Blarney” as an expression of dubiousness is attributed to Elizabeth I of England, who used it when impugning the worth of Lord Blarney’s promises. Blarney lies in wooded country. Tweed is manufactured there, as also are polypropylene sacks. Pop. (2002) 2,146; (2011) 2,437.
