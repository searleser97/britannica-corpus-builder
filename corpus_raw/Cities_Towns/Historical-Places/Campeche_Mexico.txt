Campeche,  city, port on the Gulf of Mexico, and capital of Campeche estado (state), southeastern Mexico. It lies on the Yucatán Peninsula at the western end of a fertile plain in a natural amphitheatre formed by hills overlooking the Bay of Campeche. The Spanish town was founded in 1540 on the site of a Mayan village (Kimpech), the remains of which are still visible. Pirates frequently raided Campeche and razed it in 1663, slaughtering its residents, but trade flourished again after the Spanish rebuilt it as a walled city. In the 18th century, Campeche was one of three ports on the gulf and thrived on its monopoly of Yucatán Peninsula trade, mainly exports of dyewood and salt. At various times in the early 19th century, it was the capital of Yucatán; it was made capital of the newly created Campeche state in 1863. The historic city centre was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1999.
Campeche still processes and exports regional agricultural products (notably cotton, rice, sugarcane, tropical fruits, and tobacco), but its economy is now based mainly on services (including government administration, tourism, and retail trade) and logistic support for offshore petroleum extraction and processing. Tourists are attracted by the city’s colonial churches, 17th- and 18th-century fortifications, and access to two Mayan ruins: Edzná, some 30 miles (50 km) southeast, and the gulf island of Jaina, where hundreds of burials have been excavated in a large Mayan necropolis. Campeche is linked by railroad, highway, and air to Mérida and other major cities. It is the site of the Regional Museum of Campeche (founded 1985) and the Autonomous University of Campeche (1756; refounded 1965). Pop. (2000) 190,813; (2010) 220,389.
