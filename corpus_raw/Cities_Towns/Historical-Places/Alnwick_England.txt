Alnwick,  town, unitary authority and historic county of Northumberland, northeastern England. It lies on the south bank of the River Aln, between the Cheviot Hills and the sea.
The town is dominated by the Norman castle, after 1309 the principal seat of the Percy family, who later became earls of Northumberland. The castle, now the seat of the dukes of Northumberland, was rehabilitated in the 18th century under the direction of architect Robert Adam, and the surrounding park was landscaped by Capability Brown. Much of Adamâ€™s work in the Gothic style was replaced about 1855 by Anthony Salvin, who converted the interior to an Italian Renaissance-style palace.
Hulne Park and North Demesne are remnants of the ancient hunting grounds of the marcher (border) lords. Parts of the medieval town wall (notably the Hotspur Tower), the gatehouse of Alnwick Abbey (1147), and the 15th-century grammar school survive. Alnwick was once the county town (seat) of Northumberland. Pop. (2001) 7,767; (2011) 8,116.
