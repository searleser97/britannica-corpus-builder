Kot Diji,  archaeological site located near an ancient flood channel of the Indus River in Pakistan, 15 miles (25 km) south of the city of Khairpur in Sindh province. The site, which is adjacent to the modern town of Kot Diji, consists of a stone rubble wall, dating to about 3000 bce, that surrounds a citadel and numerous residences, all of which were first excavated in the 1950s.
The origins of Kot Diji are recognized as belonging to the early Harappan period, which dates to about 3500 bce. Although Kot Diji lasted through the mature Harappan period (about 2600–1750 bce), a layer of burned debris separates structures of the early and the mature periods, which suggests that the settlement was at some point heavily damaged by fire. Artifacts, including pottery, that display a distinct Kot Dijian style have been excavated from Kot Diji and other archaeological sites in the region.
Kot Diji is located in the vicinity of several other important historic sites. It sits to the east of Mohenjo-daro, a group of mounds that contain the remains of what was once the largest city of the Indus civilization. A massive hilltop fortress constructed by Tālpur ruler Sohrāb Khān in the early 19th century is also nearby.
