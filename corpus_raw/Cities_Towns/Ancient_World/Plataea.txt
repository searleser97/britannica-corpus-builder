Plataea,   ancient city of Boeotia, Greece. It was situated on a triangular ledge 1,000 feet (300 m) above sea level, on the northern side of Mount Cithaeron below the modern village of Plataia√≠. It was well positioned in time of war to threaten the main road from Thebes to the Isthmus of Corinth, which passed east of Plataea over Mount Cithaeron. Plataea was settled by Boeotians who expelled the earlier Bronze Age inhabitants. When Thebes pressed Plataea to join a league of Boeotian cities formed in the 6th century bc, the Plataeans refused and engaged Athens (519) to protect them. Then, when the Persians landed in Attica in 490, the full Plataean levy, numbering about 1,000 men, came to the aid of Athens and fought at Marathon. In 479, Greek forces under Pausanias defeated the invading Persian army of Mardonius on the slopes of Cithaeron below Plataea, decisively crushing Persian ambitions on the Greek mainland. Thereafter the Plataeans offered sacrifice annually to Zeus the Liberator in honour of the Greek dead, and Plataea was declared inviolable by Pausanias. Nonetheless, the city was attacked by Thebans (431), then by Spartans (429), who finally razed it in 427. Thebes occupied the site until 387, then destroyed it again in 373. Athens harboured the survivors until the Macedonian kings Philip II and Alexander III the Great rebuilt Plataea after 338 as a symbol of Greek courage in resisting Persia.
