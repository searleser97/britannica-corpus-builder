Harran, also spelled Haran, Roman Carrhae,  ancient city of strategic importance, now a village, in southeastern Turkey. It lies along the Balīkh River, 24 miles (38 km) southeast of Urfa.
The town was located on the road that ran from Nineveh to Carchemish and was regarded as of considerable importance by the Assyrian kings. Its chief cult in Assyrian times was that of the moon god. It is frequently mentioned in the Bible; Abraham’s family settled there when they left Ur of the Chaldeans (Genesis 11:31–32).
In Roman times, Carrhae was the scene of a disastrous defeat of the Roman governor Marcus Licinius Crassus by the Parthians (53 bce) and of two later battles between the emperor Galerius and the Persian (Sāsānian) king Narses (296–297 ce). Pop. (2000) 8,784; (2013 est.) 7,375.
