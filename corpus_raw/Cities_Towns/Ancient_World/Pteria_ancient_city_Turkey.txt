Pteria,   ancient capital of the “White Syrians” of northern Cappadocia in eastern Anatolia, which, according to the Greek historian Herodotus, was taken, enslaved, and ruined by the Lydian king Croesus (547 bc). The exact location of Pteria is unknown. The identification of Pteria with the ruins near modern Boğazköy is uncertain. Since, according to Herodotus, Pteria was not very far from Sinope (modern Sinop), a position nearer the Black Sea seems more likely.
