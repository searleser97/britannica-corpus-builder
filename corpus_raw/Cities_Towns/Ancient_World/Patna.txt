Patna’s historic monuments include the mosque of Ḥusayn Shah of Bengal (1499); the Sikh Temple associated with the 10th Guru, Gobind Singh; and the granary at Bankipur (1786), popularly called the Golghar. The city also has the University of Patna (1917) and the Patna Museum. The city is connected by road to Hajipur, just north of the Ganges, via the Mahatma Gandhi Bridge across the river.
The ancient city of Pataliputra was founded in the 5th century bce by Ajatashatru, king of Magadha (South Bihar). His son Udaya (Udayin) made it the capital of Magadha, which it remained until the 1st century bce. The second Magadha dynasty, the Maurya, ruled in the 3rd and early 2nd centuries bce until the city was sacked in 185 by Indo-Greeks. The Shunga dynasty then began, ruling until about 73 bce. Pataliputra remained a centre of learning and in the 4th century ce became the capital of the Gupta dynasty. It declined and was deserted by the 7th century. The city was refounded as Patna by an Afghan ruler in 1541 and again rose to prosperity under the Mughal Empire. It passed to the British in 1765.
