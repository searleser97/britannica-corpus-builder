Al-Qaṭīf, also spelled Katif,  town and oasis, Al-Sharqiyyah (Eastern) region, northeastern Saudi Arabia. It lies along the Persian Gulf, over Al-Qaṭīf petroleum field. Since the development of the oil fields in the late 1940s, Al-Qaṭif has lost its status as an important port to nearby Al-Dammām. In addition to several oil wells, Al-Qaṭīf has oil-gas separator plants, pipelines, and large residential quarters for workers. A major irrigation project (completed 1964) transformed the oasis into one of the largest agricultural areas in Saudi Arabia, producing dates, alfalfa, rice, fruits, and vegetables. Pop. (2004 prelim.) 98,278.
