Al-Jaghbūb, also spelled Giarabub, or Jarabub,  oasis, northeastern Libya, near the Egyptian border. Located at the northern edge of the Libyan Desert on ancient pilgrim and caravan routes, it was the centre for the Sanūsī religious order (1856–95) because of its isolation from Turkish and European influence. The sect founded there a religious retreat and its Islāmic university and library. The walled town is dominated by the domed tomb of Sīdī Muḥammad ibn ʿAlī al-Sanūsī al-Kabīr (1791–1859), founder of the order. Its gardens produce dates. There is a road connection with Ṭubruq 180 mi (290 km) north.
