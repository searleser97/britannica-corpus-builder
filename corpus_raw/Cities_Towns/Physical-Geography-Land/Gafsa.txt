Gafsa, also spelled Qafṣah, Latin Capsa,  town situated in west-central Tunisia. The ancient name of the locality is applied to the Mesolithic Capsian industry (locally dated about 6250 bce) of the earliest inhabitants. The original Numidian town was destroyed (106 bce) by the Romans; it was rebuilt later by Trajan and was then successively a centre of Byzantine, Arab, Amazigh (Berber), and Ottoman rulers. In 1980 Gafsa was the site of a mysterious raid, the participants of which seized installations in the town before Tunisian forces recovered control the following evening. The raid, executed by Tunisians who were said to have been trained in Libya, strained relations between Tunisia and Libya and sparked an international incident.
Gafsa is a noted irrigated fruit-growing oasis and a major shipping centre for phosphates obtained from the salt flats of Chott El-Jarid (Shaṭṭ Al-Jarīd). It is connected to the port of Sfax (Ṣafāqis) by road and rail. The surrounding area includes many rich phosphate-mining concessions. It is primarily peopled by nomads and cultivators of esparto grass, cereals, dates, pistachios, apricots, fruit trees, and olives. Pop. (2004) town, 84,676.
