Southampton,  city and English Channel port, a unitary authority in the historic county of Hampshire, southern England. It lies near the head of Southampton Water, on a peninsula between the estuaries of the Rivers Test and Itchen.
In 43 ce a Roman settlement, Clausentum, was located on the east bank of the Itchen, and inscribed stones, coins, pottery, and other artifacts have been found in the area. Southampton (Hamtun, Suhampton) superseded the Saxon Hamtun and was a royal borough before 1086. The earliest town charter was given by King Henry II, probably in 1154–55, but the borough was not incorporated until 1445. Henry VI, in 1447, created Southampton a county in itself. A charter that remained in force until 1835 was granted by Charles I in 1640.
In the Middle Ages, Southampton became one of England’s major ports, exporting wool and hides from the hinterland and importing wine from the Bordeaux region of France. For the Norman and Plantagenet kings, it was the chief link with their domains across the Channel in France. Remnants of the city’s medieval prosperity include St. Michael’s Church (11th century and later); King John’s Palace (12th century), one of England’s oldest domestic buildings; and parts of the city walls, built of Caen limestone from Normandy and featuring the guildhall over the archway of Bargate, the north gate.
The port and city declined in the 17th and 18th centuries but revived in the 19th with the introduction of railways, especially the line between London and Southampton in 1840. New dock development took advantage of the spacious harbour and the prolonged high-water period, which results from a double tide caused by the presence of the Isle of Wight off the coast. A major oil-tanker terminal and refinery were established on the western shore in 1951 and began to use North Sea oil in 1978. By 1980 Southampton had become Britain’s second largest port. The city centre was rebuilt after it incurred extensive damage during World War II.
Newer manufactures (aircraft, automobiles, cables, electrical-engineering products, and petrochemicals) have joined the port’s traditional industries of shipbuilding and repairing, grain milling, and tobacco processing. Construction of major new centre-city commercial and industrial development took place in the late 20th century. The University of Southampton (1862) is in the northern suburbs. Area city and unitary authority, 19 square miles (49 square km). Pop. (2001) city and unitary authority, 217,445; urban agglom., 304,400; (2011) city and unitary authority, 236,882.
