Queens,  largest of the five boroughs of New York City, coextensive with Queens county, southeastern New York, U.S. The borough lies on western Long Island and extends across the width of the island from the junction of the East River and Long Island Sound to the Atlantic Ocean. The first settlement there was made by the Dutch in 1636 near Flushing Bay, followed by the establishment of Newtown (1642), Far Rockaway (1644), Flushing (1645), and Jamaica (1656). These settlements came under English control in 1664, when Peter Stuyvesant surrendered to an English force acting for the duke of York. In 1683 Queens county was established as one of the 12 counties of the province of New York and was named to honour the queen consort of Charles II, Catherine of Braganza.
Queens was primarily rural during the 19th century, but some of its shore communities began attracting summer vacationists. In 1898 Queens borough became part of Greater New York and at the same time assumed its present size when the towns of Hempstead, North Hempstead, and Oyster Bay opposed joining New York City and were chartered within Nassau county. Construction of the Queensboro Bridge (1909) and the Long Island Rail Road Tunnel (1910) spurred the borough’s development.
Queens is mostly residential, though it has manufacturing around Long Island City and storage and shipping facilities lining the East River. New York City’s John F. Kennedy International and La Guardia airports are in the borough, as are several branches of the City University of New York and the main campus of St. John’s University, New York. Area 121 square miles (313 square km). Pop. (2000) 2,229,379; (2010) 2,230,722.
