Bidonville, (French: “tin can city”)  name given, especially in Francophone North Africa, to the poorest slum quarters of rapidly growing, unplanned cities. Chiefly inhabited by largely unemployed squatters, these shantytowns largely consist of ramshackle constructions made from cinder blocks and sheet metal, many of which lack basic running water and sewage disposal. The name comes from the custom of using discarded oil drums (French: bidons) as building material. Large bidonvilles are found at Casablanca and Rabat in Morocco, and Algiers, Alg. Similar housing patterns, using other makeshift materials, are found in other parts of the world. Examples are the bastis (or bustis) of Indian cities such as Kolkata, the favelas of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo in Brazil, and the barriadas of Lima, Peru.
