Dumfries,  royal burgh (1186), Dumfries and Galloway council area, historic county of Dumfriesshire, situated on the left bank of the River Nith 8 miles (13 km) from the Solway Firth, an Irish Sea inlet. Dumfries is the largest burgh in southwestern Scotland. It also is the main market and processing centre for an intensive livestock farming region. In the late 2010s, some two-fifths of Scotland’s dairy products and about one-fifth of its red meat originated in the Dumfries and Galloway council area.
Designated a burgh in 1186, Dumfries suffered during the wars of Scottish independence and also from frequent raids because of its location near the English border. In 1745 the rebellious national leader Prince Charles Stuart held the town for ransom to obtain funds. Robert Burns, Scotland’s national poet, lived in Dumfries from 1791 until his death in 1796. Numerous memorials are dedicated to him, and the Burns Mausoleum, which contains the poet’s remains, was erected in 1815. Burns’s house is now a museum. Hosiery and knitwear were the traditional crafts of the town, but the production of tweed has been replaced by the food and drink industries. The retail sector and tourism are also important components of the local economy. No fewer than five bridges, including the 15th-century Old Bridge, span the River Nith. Pop. (2001) 31,560; (2011) 33,010.
