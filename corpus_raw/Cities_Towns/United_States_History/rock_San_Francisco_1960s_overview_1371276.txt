During the 1950s San Francisco supported several folk clubs including the hungry i, where the Kingston Trio recorded a best-selling live album in 1958.  But the city was a backwater of the national music industry until 1966, when promoters such as Bill Graham began booking local bands such as the Jefferson Airplane, the Grateful Dead, and Big Brother and the Holding Company at the Fillmore Auditorium and other large dance venues.
The conventions of live performance were redefined: guitarists played solos lasting for several minutes, light shows and bare-breasted dancers provided distractions, and members of the audience dressed as spectacularly as the performers;  drugs were everywhere.  With support from such deejays as Tom Donahue (first on the Top 40 station KYA and later on the new album-oriented FM stations KMPX and KSAN) and from San Francisco-based Rolling Stone magazine (founded toward the end of 1967), the city became a centre of the worldâ€™s popular music when the Fillmore West emerged as an internationally renowned venue for acts from Britain and the rest of the United States.
Most of the new local bands, however, signed for huge advances with major out-of-town labels, and the impetus was lost, never to be recaptured.  The only label to survive was Fantasy Records, across the bay in Oakland, a predominantly jazz label that never tried to compete for the new drug-culture rock groups but outsold them all with the middle-American sound of Creedence Clearwater Revival.
