Coral Sea Islands, officially Coral Sea Islands Territory,  group of islands situated east of Queensland, Austl., in the South Pacific Ocean; they constitute an external territory of Australia. Spread over a vast sea area of about 300,000 square miles (780,000 square km) off the outer (eastern) edge of the Great Barrier Reef, the islands themselves occupy only a few square miles of actual land area. They consist of widely scattered coral reefs and sand cays that support large populations of seabirds.
In 1770 Capt. James Cook explored parts of the region, and in the late 1800s guano was collected from the islands. Some of the better-known islands are Cato Island, Chilcott Islet in the Coringa group, the Willis group, and Bird Islet and West Islet, which form part of Wreck Reefs. Other formations include Heraldâ€™s Beacon Islet (part of Mellish Reef), Frederick Reef, Bougainville Reef, and Lihou Reef. The islands were declared to be Australian territory in 1969 by the Coral Sea Islands Act; Elizabeth and Middleton reefs, located south of the original territory and southeast of Brisbane, were added in 1997. Much of the territory comprises national nature reserves, but there is some commercial fishing in the area. There is a manned weather station in the Willis group; otherwise the islands are uninhabited.
