Nueva Esparta,  island estado (state), northeastern Venezuela. It lies off the Araya Peninsula of the mainland. Nueva Esparta consists of Margarita, largest of the islands, and two small neighbours, Cubagua and Coche. There are numerous small islands in the area; most of them remain uninhabited. Those islands are directly dependent on the federal government.
Margarita dominates the economic life of the state and contains most of the population. Porlamar, in southeastern Margarita, is the largest town. La Asunción, the state capital, boasts a colourful history and much distinguished architecture. Puerto Fermín is an important fishing port, and there are many small fishing villages. Fishing, pearl fishing, a tuna- and sardine-canning industry, and tourism are the principal economic activities. Pearling has been important almost since the time of Christopher Columbus, but many of the oyster beds are in danger of depletion. Although agriculture is not well developed, Nueva Esparta produces eggplant, corn (maize), melons, Cayenne peppers, and tomatoes. Fresh water is supplied by underwater pipeline from the mainland to Margarita. Area 440 square miles (1,150 square km). Pop. (2001) 373,851; (2011) 491,610.
