South Sandwich Islands,  group of actively volcanic islets in the South Atlantic Ocean, north of the Weddell Sea and 470 miles (760 km) southeast of the island of South Georgia. They extend for 190 miles (305 km), occupy 120 square miles (310 square km), and are covered with glaciers. Until 1985 they were included within the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas) as a British dependency; thereafter they formed (with South Georgia) a British overseas territory, though their administration was still based in the Falklands.
In 1775 the British explorer Capt. James Cook sighted the uninhabited islands and claimed them for Britain; they were also claimed by Argentina after 1948. The islands remained without a permanent population until 1976, when Argentine military personnel, despite protests from the British government, occupied the Southern Thule group of islands. British forces removed the Argentine personnel in June 1982 during the brief Falkland Islands War. Argentina, however, continued to claim the islands. In 1993 the British government extended the territoryâ€™s exclusive fishing zone from 12 to 200 nautical miles (22 to 370 km).
