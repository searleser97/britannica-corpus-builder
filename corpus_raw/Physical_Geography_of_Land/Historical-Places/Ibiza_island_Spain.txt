Ibiza, Catalan Eivissa,  island, Balearic Islands provincia (province) and comunidad autónoma (autonomous community), Spain. Ibiza is the third largest of the Balearic Islands. It lies in the western Mediterranean 50 miles (80 km) southwest of Majorca. The island was a strategic point of great importance in ancient times and was inhabited by the Phoenicians and Carthaginians. It has some notable archaeological sites, relics from which are housed in the Archaeological Museum at Ibiza city, also called La Vila. The island’s hilly relief, culminating in La Atalaya (1,558 feet [475 metres]), is truncated in the central northern coast to form a costa brava (rugged coast) with cliffs exceeding 800 feet (240 metres) and penetrated by calas (small coves). There are several irrigated lowlands, and the hillsides are intensively terraced. Agriculture is mainly of a subsistence nature, but almonds, dried figs, and apricots are exported. Salt produced by the evaporation of seawater has been the main export for centuries. Fish and charcoal surplus to local needs are also sent to the mainland.
Many of the inhabitants live on farms and small villages scattered throughout the island. Since the late 20th century the population of Ibiza has grown considerably, owing to immigration and the tourism that flourishes as a result of the island’s mild winter climate and its beaches. Ibiza city, San Antonio, and Santa Eularia del Río are the most-populated places. The island was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1999 for its unique and diverse ecosystems. Area 221 square miles (572 square km).
