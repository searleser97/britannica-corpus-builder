Tihāmat al-Yaman,  coastal plain in western Yemen, fronting the Red Sea. A 260-mile (420-km) southern extension of the Arabian Tihāmah (coastal plain), it consists of a strip of arid coastal land stretching between Mīdī, on the northern border with Saudi Arabia, and the Bab El-Mandeb (Arabic: Bāb Al-Mandab), a strait near the southern limit of the country. It occupies an area of 5,220 square miles (13,520 square km) and rises to a maximum elevation of 660 feet (200 metres). In its upper reaches the terrain of Tihāmat al-Yaman changes into jagged valleys incised in low plateaus. Seven major wadis, including the Mawr, Surdūd, and Zabīd, allow for some agricultural activity; irrigated fields are scattered among extensive chains of sand dunes. Dates, tobacco, and cotton are major crops. Salt is mined at Al-Ṣalīf. The Red Sea is rich in aquaculture, and fishing industries have been based along its shores in the ports of Al-Luḥayyah, Al-Ḥudaydah, Al-Ghulayfiqah, and Mocha.
