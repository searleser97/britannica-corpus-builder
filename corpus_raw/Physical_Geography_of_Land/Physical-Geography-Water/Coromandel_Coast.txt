Coromandel Coast,  broad coastal plain in eastern Tamil Nadu state, southern India. Extending over an area of about 8,800 square miles (22,800 square km), it is bounded by the Utkal Plains to the north, the Bay of Bengal to the east, the Kaveri delta to the south, and the Eastern Ghats to the west. The region derives its name from the Tamil Chola Mandalam (“Land of the Chola,”) an ancient dynasty that ruled the region from the mid-9th century ce to 1279. It also has been known since ancient times as the “land of the temples,” for the many temples that are located along the coast.
The coast has an average elevation of 264 feet (80 metres) and is backed by the Eastern Ghats, a chain of low, flat-topped hills. The shoreline is relatively straight, with several sandbars and an offshore chain of coral islands. The lower courses of the Palar, Ponnaiyar, and Cheyyar rivers and their tributaries, the Pamban and Ponnai, which rise in the Ghats, remain dry during most of the year. There is little forest cover, but marshes, swamps, scrub woodlands, and thorny thickets are common.
Agriculture is the mainstay of the coastal economy. Rice, pulses (legumes), sugarcane, cotton, and peanuts (groundnuts) are grown. Bananas and betel nuts are grown together with rice in the low-rainfall region of the interior. There are casuarina and coconut plantations along the coast. Large-scale industries produce fertilizers, chemicals, film projectors, amplifiers, trucks, and automobiles. There is a heavy vehicle and armoured car factory at Avadi and a nuclear power station at Kalapakkam. Roads and railways linking Chennai (Madras), Cuddalore, Chidambaram, Chengalpattu, and Puducherry run parallel to the coast.
