Maéwo, also called Aurora,  island of Vanuatu, in the southwestern Pacific Ocean, 65 miles (105 km) east of the island of Espiritu Santo. It is volcanic in origin and is some 35 miles (55 km) long by 4.5 miles (7.5 km) wide, with an area of about 100 square miles (260 square km). Maéwo’s central mountain range rises to 2,661 feet (811 metres) at Tawoutkararo. Well-wooded and fertile, the island receives among the highest precipitation (more than 100 inches [2,500 mm] annually) in Vanuatu. There are numerous streams, and Lakarere, on the west coast, has long been a stop for ships seeking supplies of fresh water. Annmari Bay, in the south, and Nalolo Bay, on the east coast, provide good anchorages, and there is an airstrip at Naoné, in the northwest.
