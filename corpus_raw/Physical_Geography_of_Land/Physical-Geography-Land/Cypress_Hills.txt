Cypress Hills,   isolated range in southeastern Alberta and southwestern Saskatchewan, Canada, extending for 100 miles (160 km) in an east-west direction, north of the Montana, U.S., border. Rising to 4,816 feet (1,468 m—the highest point in Saskatchewan), the hills are the most prominent relief in the southern prairies. Heavily wooded, they serve primarily as a recreation area with two provincial parks (51,200 acres [20,720 hectares] in Alberta, 44,800 acres in Saskatchewan), although coal has been mined in their eastern foothills near Shaunavon, Sask. Incorrectly named “cypress” (by Captain John Palliser, a British government surveyor, on a map he drew in 1857), for the jack pine trees that covered their slopes, the hills contain pre-Ice Age fossils, flowers, and rocks of subtropical variety found nowhere else in Canada.
