Sumbawa, Dutch Soembawa,  island of the Lesser Sunda Islands, west-central Nusa Tenggara Barat provinsi (West Nusa Tenggara province), southern Indonesia. Sumbawa has several deeply cut bays producing numerous peninsulas and the excellent harbour of Bima. The island has an area of 5,965 square miles (15,448 square km). It is largely mountainous, with rocky coasts and only a few small plains. Volcanic Mount Tambora (9,354 feet [2,851 metres]) erupted in 1815, killing 50,000 persons and causing 35,000 more to emigrate. Because shifting cultivation followed by grazing was long practiced there, large areas of the island are now covered only by thornbush. Agriculture consists of wet rice cultivation and the raising of corn (maize), beans, tubers, and some coffee and copra; cattle, goats, and horses are raised, partly for export. Sumbawa town has an airport, and a fair-weather road links it to the other main towns, Besar and Bima.
The inhabitants are of Malay ancestry, with the people in the west closely related to the Sasak of Lombok and those of Bima in the east much like the Makasarese in language and customs; Papuan traits are strong in the eastern interior. Islam is the prevailing religion. Once part of the Javanese Majapahit kingdom, the Sumbawanese nobility in 1674 signed agreements with the Dutch that gave the Dutch East India Company some power over the island. In World War II it was occupied by Japan.
