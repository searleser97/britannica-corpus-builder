Buton, Indonesian Pulau Buton, also spelled Butung, Boetoeng, or Boeton,  island in the Indonesian propinsi (or provinsi; province) of Southeast Sulawesi (Sulawesi Tenggara). It is one of a group of islands that includes also Muna, Wowoni, and Kabaena. Its chief town, administrative centre, and port is Baubau on the southwestern coast. With an area of 1,620 square miles (4,200 square km), it is thickly forested and has an axial chain of limestone hills rising to 3,904 feet (1,190 metres). Buton yields much natural asphalt; teak is used for boatbuilding. The island produces coconuts, and there is some pearl dealing.

The coastal people, most of whom are Buginese, carry on weaving and copperwork but are chiefly trading sailors and fishermen.
