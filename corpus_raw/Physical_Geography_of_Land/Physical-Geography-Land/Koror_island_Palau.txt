Koror, formerly Corrora,  one of the Caroline Islands that is part of Palau. It lies in the western Pacific Ocean just southwest of Babelthuap island. Koror city served as the provisional capital of Palau until 2006, when the capital was moved to Melekeok in eastern Babelthuap. Partly uplifted coralline limestone and partly volcanic in origin, Koror has a land area of 3 square miles (8 square km) and rises to 459 feet (140 metres). A territorial centre under Japanese administration (before 1944), Koror was well-populated (about 30,000 people) and highly developed. Devastated during World War II, it subsequently developed as an increasingly important commercial and tourist centre. A copra-processing plant opened in 1976. Koror harbour has several large natural anchorages, the most important of which is Ngemelachel—now the city’s industrial and shipping suburb. Nearly three-quarters of Palau’s population lives in Koror, and the city has one of the highest population densities in Micronesia. In 1996 a concrete cantilever bridge connecting Koror with Babelthuap—at the time of its construction (1977) the longest such span in the world—collapsed, crippling the country’s transportation, communication, and water networks. A pontoon bridge was used until a new suspension bridge was opened in 2002. Pop. (2005) Koror state, 12,676.
