ʿAbd al-Kūrī,  island in the Indian Ocean, about 65 miles (105 km) southwest of Socotra. Although the island belongs to Yemen (the mainland of which is situated more than 200 miles [320 km] to the north), geographically the island is closer to the Horn of Africa—it is about 70 miles (110 km) east-northeast of Cape Gwardafuy (Guardafui). The rocky island, about 22 miles (35 km) long and about 3 miles (5 km) wide, reaches an altitude of more than 2,300 feet (700 metres) at Mount Ṣāliḥ, its highest point. The island is more barren than neighbouring Socotra, and much of it is semi-desert with little vegetation; in spite of this, however, there are a number of plant species endemic to ʿAbd al-Kūrī alone. Most of the island’s inhabitants subsist on fishing.
