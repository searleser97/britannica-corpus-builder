Somerset Island,  island in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, Nunavut. It is separated from Boothia Peninsula (south) by the narrow Bellot Strait, from Prince of Wales Island (west) by Peel Sound, and from Baffin Island (east) by Prince Regent Inlet. It is about 160 miles (260 km) long, 22–105 miles (35–170 km) wide, and has an area of 9,370 square miles (24,260 square km). Cliffs more than 1,200 feet (366 metres) high on its northwest coast are backed by inland hills rising to 2,500 feet (765 metres). Creswell Bay thrusts deeply into the island’s east coast; Fort Ross, the only trading post, lies at its southern tip. The island was discovered in 1819 by Sir William Parry, who named it for his native county in England.
