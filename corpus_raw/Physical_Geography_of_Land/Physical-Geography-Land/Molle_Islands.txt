Molle Islands,   group of four small formations on the Great Barrier Reef, in Whitsunday Passage in the Coral Sea, 3 miles (5 km) off the northeastern coast of Queensland, Australia. In 1815 the patch of water behind the group was named Port Molle for Colonel George Molle. The name was later applied to the islands and to the deepwater passage between them and the mainland. The islands are coral-fringed, with steep grassy hills. South Molle, the largest (1,040 acres [421 hectares]), measures 2.5 by 1.5 miles and rises to 622 feet (190 m) at Mount Jeffrey. It is a national park and resort accessible by launch from Shute Harbour (south). A rocky bar connects it to 25-acre Mid Molle. North Molle (600 acres), the highest of the group (760 feet), is a resort, as is West Molle (80 acres), also known as Daydream Island.
