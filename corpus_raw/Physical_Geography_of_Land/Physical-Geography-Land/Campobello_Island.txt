Campobello Island,  second largest island (9 miles [14 km] long by 3 miles [5 km] wide), after Grand Manan, of a small island group at the entrance to Passamaquoddy Bay (an inlet of the Bay of Fundy), southwestern New Brunswick, southeastern Canada. Although politically Canadian and administered as part of Charlotte County, the island is closely associated with the United States as the site of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s summer home.
It was originally granted in 1767 to Captain William Owen of the Royal Navy, who in 1770 contrived its name from that of Lord William Campbell, then provincial governor, as campobello (Spanish-Italian: “fair field”), referring to the island’s appearance. James Roosevelt, father of the president, bought a house on the west coast at Welshpool (Welchpool) in 1883, and in 1906 Franklin D. Roosevelt was given by his mother the adjoining 34-room “cottage,” which became well known as the presidential retreat in the 1930s. There Roosevelt was stricken with polio in 1921. The dwelling was subsequently deeded as a memorial museum to the governments of Canada and the United States and is now maintained within the 2,721-acre (1,101-hectare) Roosevelt Campobello International Park (opened in 1964).
The island, linked to Lubec, Maine, by the Roosevelt International Bridge (1962), is inhabited by fishermen. It is indented with sandy coves and inlets (havens for fishing boats) and has rugged headlands with picturesque lighthouses. Campobello Provincial Park overlooks the scenic Herring Cove on the west coast.
