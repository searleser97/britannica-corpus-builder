The atoll is 15–25 feet (5–8 metres) above sea level; it is circular in shape, with 8 miles (13 km) of shoreline, and encloses a freshwater lagoon.

From 1916 to 1925 Swains was a part of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands. It became part of American Samoa in 1925. Copra is the chief product. Area approximately 1 square mile (2.6 square km). Pop.
