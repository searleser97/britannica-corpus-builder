Kīrthar Range,  hill region in southern Pakistan. It extends southward for about 190 miles (300 km) from the Mūla River in east-central Balochistān to Cape Muāri (Monze) west of Karāchi on the Arabian Sea. The range forms the boundary between the Lower Indus Plain (east) and southern Balochistān (west). It consists of a series of parallel, rock hill ridges rising from 4,000 feet (1,200 m) in the south to nearly 8,000 feet (2,500 m) in the north. It is drained in the north by the Kolāchi River and in the south by the Hab and Lyāri rivers, which flow to the Arabian Sea. The inhabitants of the region, chiefly Baloch, Jāṭ, and Brahui tribes, subsist by flock grazing.
