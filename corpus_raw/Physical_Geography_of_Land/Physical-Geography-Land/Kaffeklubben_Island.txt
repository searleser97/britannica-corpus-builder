Kaffeklubben Island,   island and one of the world’s northernmost points of land, in the Arctic Ocean, 37 km (20 nautical miles) east of Cape Morris Jesup, Greenland. Kaffeklubben (Danish: “Coffee Club”) was discovered in 1900 by Robert E. Peary, the American Arctic explorer. The island was visited in 1921 by the Danish explorer Lauge Koch, who named it for the Kaffeklub at the Mineralogical Museum in Copenhagen. In 1969 a Canadian expedition determined that the island’s northernmost point was 750 m (826 yards) farther north than Cape Morris Jesup, which had been thought to be the world’s most northerly land point. Unconfirmed measurements by the Danish Geodetic Institute, however, indicated yet another island (unnamed) even farther north than Kaffeklubben.
