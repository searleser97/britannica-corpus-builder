Tortue Island, French Île de la Tortue, Spanish Isla de la Tortuga,  Caribbean island off the northern coast of Haiti opposite Port-de-Paix. European adventurers settled Tortue in 1629, in conjunction with trying to establish a foothold on the neighbouring island of Hispaniola (now comprising Haiti and the Dominican Republic). Known as filibusters and buccaneers, these “Brethren of the Coast” harassed Spanish shipping. The English, French, and Spanish in turn dominated Tortue until the French gained permanent possession in 1665.
In the 1880s France, Britain, and the United States considered the island, which is 20 miles (32 km) long by 3 miles (5 km) wide, strategically important, but thereafter it became of little value either in international affairs or in the Haitian economy. On its highest point is the small village of Palmiste.
