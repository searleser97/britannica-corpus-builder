Santa Fe Island, also called Barrington Island,  one of the Galápagos Islands, in the eastern Pacific Ocean, about 600 mi (965 km) west of Ecuador. Situated halfway between San Cristóbal and Santa Cruz islands, it is south of the vortex of the archipelago, is dotted with small volcanic cones, and has an area of 7 1/2 sq mi (19 sq km). The island was originally named for Sir Samuel Barrington, a 19th-century British admiral; its present official Ecuadorian name is Isla Santa Fe. A dried-up watercourse cut through lava leads to Barrington Harbour, a landlocked bay in the islands that has seal rookeries at either end.
