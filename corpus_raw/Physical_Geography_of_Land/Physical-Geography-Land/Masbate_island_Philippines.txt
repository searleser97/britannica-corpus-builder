Masbate,  island and town, central Philippines. Masbate island is part of the Visayan island group, bordered by the Sibuyan (west), Visayan (south), and Samar (east) seas. The island lies 30 miles (48 km) southwest of the southern tip of Luzon and is V-shaped, with the open end of the V forming the Asid Gulf on the south. The discontinuous highlands that stretch along both arms of the V represent the major structural arcs of the Philippine archipelago. Masbateâ€™s interior consists of rolling hills; grasslands cover two-thirds of the island. Agriculture (corn [maize], rice, and root crops) is the dominant economic activity. The island has several livestock ranches and a government cattle-breeding station. Commercial fishing is concentrated in the southwest near Balud. Gold was mined for centuries near Aroroy in the north; operations declined in the 1960s, but they resumed in 2007 on the remaining substantial reserves there. Copper is found in the southeast.
Masbate town, located on the northeastern coast of the island, is the commercial centre, with trade in copra, corn, fish, and cattle; the town has an airport. Cataingan, Placer, Milagros, and Dimasalang are other important towns. Area 1,262 square miles (3,269 square km). Pop. (2000) island, 707,668; mun., 71,441; (2010) island, 834,650; mun., 85,227.
