King Leopold Ranges,   mountain chain of northern Western Australia, forming the southwestern edge of the Kimberley Plateau. It comprises a well-dissected escarpment extending from Collier Bay southeast for 150 miles (240 km). Averaging 2,000 feet (600 m) in height, the ranges rise to just over 3,000 feet (about 915 m) at Mounts Ord and Broome. Rivers such as the Isdel, Adcock, Lennard, and Fitzroy cut the scrub-covered escarpment into several steep-sided segments, the peaks of which are generally level. The ranges were sighted in 1879 by Alexander Forrest, who named them after Leopold II, king of the Belgians.
