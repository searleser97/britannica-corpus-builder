Marchena Island,   one of the smaller (area 45 sq mi [117 sq km]) of the Gal√°pagos Islands, in the eastern Pacific Ocean, 600 mi (965 km) west of Ecuador. Called Bindloe in the 17th century by English pirates in honour of a member of the Jamaican council who condoned their activities, the island was renamed Torres in the late 18th century by the Spanish navigator Don Alonso de Torres, and finally by the Ecuadorian government as Marchena. The uninhabited island is dominated by a single volcanic crater.
