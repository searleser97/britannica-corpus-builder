Azov Upland, Ukrainian Pryazovska Vysochyna,  hilly region, southeastern Ukraine. Part of the Ukrainian Crystalline Shield, the Azov Upland is an area of denuded mountains, extending from the Dnieper River for 100 miles (160 km) to the Donets Ridge and sloping gently down southeastward to the Sea of Azov. The highest point is Mount Mohyla-Belmak (1,063 feet [324 m]), 65 miles (105 km) southwest of Donetsk. The soil cover, which is extensively cultivated, is of the chernozem type, and sheep fescue and feather grass are found on the slopes of the mountains. The Berda, Molochna, and Obytichna rivers have their sources in the upland.
