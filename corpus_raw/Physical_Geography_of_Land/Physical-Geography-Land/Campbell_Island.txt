Campbell Island,  outlying volcanic island of New Zealand, in the South Pacific Ocean, 400 miles (644 km) south of South Island. It has an area of 41 square miles (106 square km) and is high and rugged, rising to 1,867 feet (569 m) at Mount Honey, and gradually leveling off to the north. Cliffs border the west and south coasts, while the east is deeply indented by Perseverance and North East harbours. The island has a cold, humid, windy climate.
Campbell Island was discovered in 1810 by the sealing ship “Perseverance.” The island’s large herds of fur seals were quickly decimated, but it remained a port of call for whalers until the 1890s. Sheep, unsuccessfully introduced in 1896, destroyed much of the natural vegetation. A meteorological station was established in 1941. The island is administered by the New Zealand commissioner for crown lands.
