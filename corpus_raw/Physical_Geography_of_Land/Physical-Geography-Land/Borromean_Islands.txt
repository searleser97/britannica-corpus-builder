Borromean Islands, Italian Isole Borromeo,  four tiny (about 50 acres [20 hectares]) islands in Lake Maggiore, off Baveno and Stresa, Verbano-Cusio-Ossola provincia, Piemonte (Piedmont) regione, northwestern Italy. Geologic continuations of the Pallanza promontory, the islets are named for the Borromeo family, to whom they have belonged since the 12th century. Isola Bella, named for Isabella, countess Borromeo, is known for its ch√¢teau and terraced gardens, built by Count Vitaliano Borromeo (died 1690). To the northeast is Isola Madre, the largest of the group, with a palazzo and gardens; to the north, off Pallanza, is the smallest, Isola di San Giovanni. The westernmost is Isola Superiore, or Isola dei Pescatori, occupied by a picturesque fishing village.
