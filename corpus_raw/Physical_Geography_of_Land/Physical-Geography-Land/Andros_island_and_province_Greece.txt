It is the most northerly and second largest of the Cyclades (Modern Greek: Kykládes) group of Greek Aegean Islands. Its principal town is Ándros, on the east coast.
Ándros is wooded, well watered, and mountainous, South of the capital is the port of Kórthion, which lies at the foot of the Palaiókastron (2,050 feet [625 metres]), with ruins of a Venetian castle and medieval town. The ruins of Palaeopolis, the island’s ancient capital, support a hamlet, Palaiópolis, on the western coast. Figs, citrus fruits, wine grapes, and olives are grown on the island.
The ancient population was mainly Ionian. Originally dependent on Eretria, Ándros sent colonies to Chalcidice, the great peninsula of northeastern Greece, in the 7th century bce. It submitted to Persia in 490 bce and was harried by the Athenian fleet for supplying ships to the Persian king Xerxes I in 480. The Athenian leader Pericles forced Ándros to admit Athenian settlers, but it revolted in 411 or 410. During the 4th century bce it was again a member of the revived anti-Spartan Delian League.
In 200 bce it was captured by a combined Roman, Pergamese, and Rhodian fleet. It remained with Pergamum until 133, when it became part of the Roman province of Asia. From 1207 ce it was under the protection of Venice until it fell to the Ottoman Empire in 1566. It became part of Greece in 1829. Area 145 square miles (380 square km). Pop.
