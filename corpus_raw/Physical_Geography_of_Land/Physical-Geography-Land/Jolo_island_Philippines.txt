Jolo,  island and town, southwestern Philippines. The island, in the Sulu Archipelago between the Sulu (west) and Celebes (east) seas, is characterized by lush tropical vegetation, many short streams, and several extinct volcanoes, including Mount Tumatangas at 2,664 feet (812 metres). Mount Dajo National Park is a game refuge with an area of 526 acres (213 hectares). Jolo has considerable arable land that supports agriculture (rice, coconuts, cassava, fruits), but the principal economic activity is fishing. The main population centres are Jolo town, Parang, Patikul, and Talipaw.
Jolo town, on the northwestern coast, is a port of entry and capital of the province of Sulu. A focal point of a lively trade with Zamboanga City, Manila, Singapore, and the island of Borneo, it has a pier that can accommodate interisland vessels, oceangoing freighters, and naval craft. Smaller piers serve smaller local craft. Jolo also has an airport. The town, settled before the introduction of Islam in the 14th century, became the residence of the Sulu sultans. In 1876 the Spanish attempted to gain control over the independent Muslims by burning Jolo, their chief settlement. The walled, fortified town that the Spaniards then constructed formed the nucleus of the modern town. Jolo was devastated in 1974 in fighting between Muslims and government troops. Area island, 345 square miles (894 square km). Pop. (2000) town, 87,998; (2010) town, 118,307.
