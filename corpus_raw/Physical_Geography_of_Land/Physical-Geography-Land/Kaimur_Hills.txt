Kaimur Hills, also called Kaimur Range,  eastern portion of the Vindhya Range, starting near Katangi in the Jabalpur district of Madhya Pradesh and running generally east for a distance of about 300 miles (480 km) to Sasaram in Bihar. Its maximum width is about 50 miles (80 km).
After traversing the northern part of Jabalpur and southeast Maihar, the range turns to the east and runs through Rewa. There it separates the valley of the Son and Tons rivers and continues into the Mirzapur district of Uttar Pradesh and the Shahabad district of West Bengal. The range has a distinctive jagged appearance in Madhya Pradesh, with metamorphic rock formations and upheaved rock strata. The range almost disappears at places, being marked by a low chain of rocks, and it never rises more than a few thousand feet above the plain. The ruined fort of Rohtas is situated in these hills, and archaeological explorations have uncovered well-preserved prehistoric rock art and paintings in caves and sheltered areas in Bihar.
