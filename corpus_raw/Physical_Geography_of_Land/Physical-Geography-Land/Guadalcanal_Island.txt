Guadalcanal Island,  largest island of the country of Solomon Islands, southwestern Pacific Ocean. The island has an area of 2,047 square miles (5,302 square km) and is of volcanic origin. It has a mountainous spine (Kavo Range) that culminates in Mount Popomanaseu (7,644 feet [2,330 metres]), the highest point in the country. Many short, rapid streams, including the Mataniko, Lungga, and Tenaru, tumble from the wooded mountains to the coast, which in some places is lined with mangrove swamps. The economy is based mainly on fishing, coconuts, timber, cacao (the source of cocoa), oil palms, and fruit; there are occasional workings in alluvial gold and silver. Honiara, the national capital, is on the north coast.
Guadalcanal is named for a town in Spain  by the Spanish explorer Álvaro de Mendaña de Neira, who visited the region in 1568. The British navigator Lieut. John Shortland explored the sheltered anchorages along the northern coast in 1788. English traders followed, and the island was annexed (1893) by the British as part of the Solomon Islands Protectorate. During World War II it was the scene of the protracted Battle of Guadalcanal, fought on land and sea by Allied and Japanese forces.
Long-simmering ethnic tensions between Guadalcanal islanders and migrants from Malaita worsened after World War II. After independence (1978), ethnically based disputes over land tenure on the island took shape. These tensions sparked widespread violence starting in 1998 and underlaid the paramilitary coup of June 2000, which overthrew the national government.
