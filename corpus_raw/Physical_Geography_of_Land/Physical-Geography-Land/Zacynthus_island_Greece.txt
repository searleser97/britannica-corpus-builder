Zacynthus, Modern Greek Zákynthos, also spelled Zákinthos,  island, southernmost and third largest of the Ionian Islands (Modern Greek: Iónia Nisiá) of Greece, lying off the west coast of the Peloponnese (Pelopónnisos). Including the tiny Strotádhes Islands to the south, it constitutes a dímos (municipality) and perifereiakí enótita (regional unit) in the Ionian Islands periféreia (region). Zacynthus is indented by a deep bay with high cliffs on its south coast. The centre of Zacynthus is a fertile plain bounded on the west by barren limestone hills, 700 to 1,600 feet (200 to 500 metres) high, with many sinkholes and steep sea cliffs. The hills culminate in the 2,480-foot- (756-metre-) high Mount Vrakhiónas. The plain is bounded on the east by a low range of hills. The capital of the island and nomós, Zákynthos town, lies on the east coast on the site of ancient Zacynthus; it is the seat of a metropolitan bishop.
Zacynthus was named for an ancient Arcadian chief; the 5th-century-bce historian Thucydides said that it was colonized by Achaeans from the Peloponnese. The island was used by the Athenians during the Peloponnesian War and again in 374 bce. The Romans captured it in 211 and 191, annexing Zacynthus to keep it out of the Achaean League.
Zacynthus was repeatedly pillaged by the Vandals and Saracens, and in 1185 it was taken, along with the islands of Corfu (Kérkyra), Cephallenia, and Leucas, by Margarito of Brindisi. From 1194 to 1328 it was held by the Orsini and from 1328 to 1482 was in the possession of the counts of Tocchi. Venice was granted the island in 1485, to prevent its falling to the Turks, and held it until 1797, when it was ceded to France by the Treaty of Campo Formio. After a short Russian occupation, it became (1815) part of the British protectorate of the Ionian Islands; it prospered with the revival of Greek culture. In 1864 Zacynthus was ceded, with the other Ionian Islands, to Greece.
Both the central plains and eastern hills are cultivated. The chief exports are currants, olive oil, wines, and fresh fruit. Destructive earthquakes were experienced in 1514, 1893, and 1953. The island’s buildings were extensively rebuilt after the last earthquake disaster. Pop. (2001) 38,883; (2011) 40,759.
