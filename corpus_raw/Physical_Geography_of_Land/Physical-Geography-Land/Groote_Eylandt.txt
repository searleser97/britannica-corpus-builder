Groote Eylandt,  island off the northeast coast of  Northern Territory, Australia. It is the largest island of an archipelago of the same name in the Gulf of Carpentaria, 25 miles (40 km) across Warwick Channel. Groote Eylandt is a barren and rocky outlier of the sunken coast of the Arnhem Land plateau that has deeply embayed north and east coasts  and rises to 520 feet (158 metres) at its centre.
Aboriginal peoples inhabited the island beginning about 8,000 years ago. For centuries, fishers from Makassar journeyed to the surrounding waters in search of bêche-de-mer (trepang). The island was sighted in 1623 by Dutch seamen and was named Groote Eylandt (“Big Island”) by the Dutch navigator Abel Janszoon Tasman in 1644. The English explorer Matthew Flinders made a circumnavigation of it in 1803. The Church Missionary Society established a mission and store there in 1921. The island’s airstrip was used by the Royal Australian Air Force during World War II.
Groote Eylandt was long part of the Groote Eylandt Aboriginal Reserve. In 1976 land rights were granted to the Anindilyakwa Aboriginal people, who declared the archipelago the Anindilyakwa Indigenous Protected Area in 2006. The island has an airport with regularly scheduled flights to the Gove Peninsula and Darwin in the Northern Territory and Cairns, Queensland. The township of Angurugu, on the west coast, is the main settlement. Manganese deposits have been exploited on a large scale since 1966. There are numerous offshore reefs and islets, one of which, Chasm Island, has caves containing Aboriginal art. Area 950 square miles (2,460 square km). Pop. (2006) Angurugu urban centre, 809; (2011) Angurugu urban centre, 835.
