Devilsbit Mountain,  range of hills in County Tipperary, Ireland, that  extends from the boundary of County Limerick to the lowland opening known as the Roscrea Gap. The name derives from the gap in the highest peak in the range (1,577 feet [481 metres]), which, according to legend, was formed by the Devilâ€™s biting a piece out of the limestone outcrop and spitting out the piece now known as the Rock of Cashel, whose dimensions are roughly the same as those of the gap. The basic rock is sandstone, much modified by glacial action.
