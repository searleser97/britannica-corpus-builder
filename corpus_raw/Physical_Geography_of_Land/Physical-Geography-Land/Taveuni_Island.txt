Taveuni Island,  third largest island of Fiji, South Pacific Ocean. The island has an area of 168 square miles (435 square km). It lies off the southeast coast of Vanua Levu and was sighted by the Dutch navigator Abel Janszoon Tasman in 1643. Volcanic in origin, it has a central mountain ridge that culminates in Uluinggalau (4,072 feet [1,241 metres]). The chief village is Somosomo on the western coast. Taveuni is known as “the garden island of Fiji” because of its abundant plant life, which includes several species found only on the island. Bouma National Heritage Park, on the eastern side, contains pristine rainforest and three waterfalls, each some 65 feet (20 metres) high. Copra is the chief product. The island has become a popular tourist destination, and a number of resorts were built beginning in the late 20th century. There is an airstrip at the northern end of the island. Most inhabitants are Melanesian.
