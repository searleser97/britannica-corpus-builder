Siphnus, Modern Greek Sífnos,  Greek island of the Cyclades (Modern Greek: Kykládes) group, consisting of a limestone ridge whose principal peaks, Profíts Ilías (2,277 feet [694 metres]) and Áyios Simeón (1,624 feet [495 metres]), are crowned by Byzantine churches. It constitutes a dímos (municipality) in the South Aegean (Nótio Aigaío) periféreia (region). In antiquity Siphnus was colonized by Athens. Its gold and silver mines financed a treasury at Delphi about 525 bce, but by the 1st century ce they were flooded. A refuge from iconoclastic persecutions at Byzantium during the early Christian era, the island has many Byzantine and post-Byzantine churches and monasteries, some in ruins. Part of the Venetian duchy of Náxos after 1207, it was recovered by the Byzantines in the 1270s and then ruled by Venetian families from 1307 to 1617, after which the Turks held sway. The main town, Apollonía, lies just southeast of the west-coast port of Kamáres. On the east coast, the village of Kástro is on the site of the ancient capital. Chief industries are pottery making and fishing. Pop. (2001) 2,574; (2011) 2,625.
