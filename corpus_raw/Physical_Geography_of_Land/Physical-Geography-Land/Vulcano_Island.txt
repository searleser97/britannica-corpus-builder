Vulcano Island, Italian Isola Vulcano, Greek Hiera, Latin Vulcana,  southernmost of the Eolie Islands, in the Tyrrhenian Sea (of the Mediterranean), off northeastern Sicily. It is administered as part of  northern Sicily, southern Italy. Vulcano has an area of 8 square miles (21 square km). Although the last major eruptions were in 1888â€“90, fumaroles of sulfurous vapour testify to continuous volcanic activity, and its Gran Cratere is still active. See also Eolie Islands.
