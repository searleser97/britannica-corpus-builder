Great Rye Island, Slovak Vel’ký Žitný Ostrov,  riverine island, Západní Slovensko kraj (region), Slovakia. The island lies southeast of Bratislava, between the Little Danube and Váh rivers to the north and the Danube to the south. It is composed of rich alluvial sediments deposited by the Danube in the Little Alföld, which is a plain shared by Hungary and Slovakia. Like Little Schütt Island (Szigetköz) on the Hungarian side of the Danube, Great Rye Island is extensively cultivated in grains, mostly wheat and rye, and is canalized to facilitate this in its eastern end northwest of Komárno.
