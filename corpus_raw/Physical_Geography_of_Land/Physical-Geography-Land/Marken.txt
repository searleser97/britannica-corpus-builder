Marken,  island and gemeente (municipality),  west-central Netherlands, within the IJsselmeer. Lying some 11 miles (17 km) northeast of Amsterdam, Marken was separated from the mainland in the 13th century during the formation of the Zuiderzee. The 2-mile- (3-km-) long island has an area of 1 square mile (2.5 square km) and lies about 1.5 miles (2.5 km) offshore. Since 1957 it has been connected to the mainland by a causeway. Before the Zuiderzee was made into the IJsselmeer by the 19-mile (30-km) Afsluitdijk, the inhabitants of Marken and its neighbouring island of Volendam made their living from fishing, especially for eels. Most residents are orthodox Calvinists. Their houses were grouped on small mounds and built on piles to protect against high tides. The island has retained much of the atmosphere of past days. During tourist season the residents enhance this effect by dressing in traditional regional costumes. Tourism is now an important economic factor. Pop. (latest est.) 2,055.
