Barrow Island,  Australian island in the Indian Ocean, 30 miles (50 km) off the northwest coast of Western Australia and 10 miles (16 km) southwest of the Montebello Islands. Measuring 12 by 5 miles (19 by 8 km), it has an area of 78 square miles (202 square km). It is geologically an extension of the Carnarvon Basin on the mainland. Barrow Island is characterized by its aridity and by its grass- and bush-covered sand hills, which rise steeply to heights of 270 feet (80 m). Once a turtle fishery, the island became the site of Western Australia’s first commercial oil field in 1967 and is today one of Australia’s richest oil fields. Oil is extracted through fracturing of rocks, and there are no derricks, but “Christmas tree” pipe structures dot the landscape. Because of the shallowness of the surrounding sea, the oil must be carried 6 miles (10 km) offshore via a submarine pipe to a tanker-loading jetty. There are also oil deposits on Pasco Island, 4 miles (6 km) south.
