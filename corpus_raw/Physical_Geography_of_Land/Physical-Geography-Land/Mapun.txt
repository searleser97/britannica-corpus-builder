Mapun, also called Cagayan Sulu,  island, southwestern Sulu Sea, Philippines. Low-lying and surrounded by 13 small islets and coral reefs, it has an area of 26 square miles (67 square km). Mapun was a centre of pirate activity by Muslims (Moros) in the 19th century. The island (together with Sibutu island) was inadvertently omitted when the United States acquired the Philippine islands from Spain in 1898, but it was purchased from Spain in 1900 and was part of the Philippines when independence was granted in 1935. Dry-rice agriculture, copra production, and trading are the principal economic activities. The Jama Mapun people constitute the great majority of the islandâ€™s population. They speak a Sama-Bajau language of the Austronesian language family, and most are adherents of Islam.
