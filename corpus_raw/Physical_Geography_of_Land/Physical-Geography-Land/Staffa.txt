Staffa,  uninhabited Atlantic island of the Inner Hebrides, Scotland, situated 6 miles (10 km) off the island of Mull and 33 miles west of Oban. Columns of basalt surmount a basement of tufa and form a rugged coast with numerous caves, among them Clamshell Cave in the southeast and Fingalâ€™s Cave, a haunt of seals and seabirds. During the tourist season, steamers from neighbouring islands carry visitors to Staffa.
