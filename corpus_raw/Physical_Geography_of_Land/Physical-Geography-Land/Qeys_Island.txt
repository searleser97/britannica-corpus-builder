Qeys Island, also spelled Qais, Persian Jazīreh-ye Qeys,  island in the Persian Gulf, lying about 10 miles (16 km) off mainland Iran. It rises 120 feet (37 metres) above sea level to a plateau and is almost without vegetation except for a few date groves and stunted herbage. Qeys attained importance only in the late 1st millennium ad, when a prince obtained it, built a fleet, and gradually extended his power. He captured Sīrāf (modern Ṭāherī), then a large market, but in the 11th century, Qeys supplanted Sīrāf. At its zenith the dynasty of Qeys also ruled over part of the Arabian shore; the islanders traded in Persian, Mesopotamian, Arabian, and Indian products. The site of the old city is marked by the ruins known as Harīreh (modern Deh) on the northern coast. Qeys lost its importance in the 14th century.
