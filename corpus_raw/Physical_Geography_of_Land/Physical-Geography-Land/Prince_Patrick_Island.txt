Prince Patrick Island,  westernmost of the Parry Islands, in the Arctic Ocean, Northwest Territories, Canada. It is separated from Melville Island (southeast) by the Kellett and Fitzwilliam straits and from Banks Island (south) by M’Clure Strait. Prince Patrick Island is about 150 miles (240 km) long, 20–50 miles (30–80 km) wide, and 6,119 square miles (15,848 square km) in area. It consists mainly of a sandstone plateau rising from a low, irregular coastline to a height of 810 feet (250 metres) in the southeast. Discovered in 1853 by the British explorer Francis (later Sir Francis) McClintock, it was named for Prince Arthur William Patrick (later the Duke of Connaught), third son of Queen Victoria.
