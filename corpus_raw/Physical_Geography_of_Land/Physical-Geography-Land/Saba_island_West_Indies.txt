Saba,  island and special municipality within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, in the Lesser Antilles in the northeastern Caribbean Sea. It lies 16 miles (26 km) northwest of Sint Eustatius, with which it forms the northwestern termination of the inner volcanic arc of the Lesser Antilles. Its capital is The Bottom. Saba is actually the peak of an extinct volcano, Mount Scenery (2,910 feet [887 metres]), surrounded by sea cliffs. It is windward with respect to the northeastern trade winds and receives about 44 inches (1,125 mm) of rain annually. The villages of The Bottom and Windward Side, occupying the old volcanic crater, are approached up a steep road from a rocky landing place on the southern coast.
Saba was settled by the Dutch in 1632 but, because of its inaccessibility and ruggedness, never achieved economic importance and often functioned as a buccaneersâ€™ stronghold. In 1828 Saba, together with Sint Eustatius, formed a colony of the Dutch West Indies, which came under collective administration with the other Dutch dependencies in the region in 1845. These dependencies were formed into the Netherlands Antilles in 1954, and each was given autonomy in internal affairs. In 2006 the people of Saba, along with those of the other islands and the government of the Netherlands, agreed to dissolve the Netherlands Antilles; this occurred on Oct. 10, 2010. Saba, like Bonaire and Sint Eustatius, became a special municipality with close relations with the central government.
The spoken language is English, and Roman Catholicism is the dominant religion. The population, about half of whom are of African descent and half of European descent, depends heavily on tourism and is engaged in raising livestock and cultivating vegetables, particularly potatoes, which are exported to neighbouring islands. Area 5 square miles (13 square km). Pop. (2010 est.) 1,737.
