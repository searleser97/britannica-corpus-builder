Vanua Lava,  volcanic island in the Banks Islands of Vanuatu, southwestern Pacific Ocean, 75 miles (120 km) north-northeast of Espiritu Santo. The island, 15 miles (24 km) long by 12 miles (19 km) wide, was first explored in 1859 by Bishop George Selwyn, who located a good harbour (Port Patteson) on the east coast. He named Port Patteson for John Coleridge Patteson, a missionary who became the first Anglican bishop of Melanesia. A second harbour, Veutümboso (Vureas or Avareas) Bay, is on the southwest coast. The active volcano Séré’ama rises to 3,021 feet (921 metres); the highest point is Tow Lav at 3,104 feet (946 metres). The island exports copra and cacao.
