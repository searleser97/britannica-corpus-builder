Vestmanna Islands, Vestmanna also spelled Vestmann or Westman, Icelandic Vestmannaeyjar,  group of 14 small Icelandic islands off Iceland’s southern shore. They have a total area of about 8 square miles (21 square km). Volcanic in origin, the islands are rocky and barren, with precipitous cliffs up to 1,000 feet (300 m) in height rising straight up from the Atlantic Ocean.
The largest and only inhabited island is Heimaey, 4 miles (6 km) in length, on which the town of Vestmannaeyjar is located. Fishing and some limited farming are the chief economic activities. The fiery emergence in 1963–67 of the volcanic isle of Surtsey, 14 miles (23 km) southwest, covered the island group with a layer of ash. In January 1973 a volcanic eruption broke out on Heimaey. The eruption continued until early summer and destroyed about one-third of Vestmannaeyjar town. Pop. (2006 est.) 4,075.
