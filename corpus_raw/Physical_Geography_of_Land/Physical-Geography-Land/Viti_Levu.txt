Viti Levu,  largest island (4,026 square miles [10,429 square km]) of Fiji, west of the Koro Sea in the South Pacific Ocean. Its name means “Great Fiji.” Sighted (1789) by Capt. William Bligh of HMS Bounty, the island is split by a central mountain range with many inactive volcanoes. Tomanivi (formerly Mount Victoria), the highest point in Fiji, rises to 4,344 feet (1,324 metres). The mountain range divides the island climatically into a wet southeastern section (120 inches [3,050 mm] of rain annually) and a dry northwestern section (70–90 inches (1,800–2,300 mm).
Suva, the Fijian capital, is situated on the island’s southeastern coast and has an excellent harbour. Lautoka, on the northwestern coast, is a port for a sugarcane-growing region. Sugar, pineapples, rice, and tobacco are cultivated in the fertile valleys and deltas of the Navua, Rewa, and Sigatoka (Singatoka) rivers. A goldfield at Vatukoula, in the north-central part of the island, was first developed in the 1930s. Nadi (Nandi), in the west, has the country’s main international airport, and an oil-fuel installation is at nearby Vunda Point. There is a smaller international airport northeast of Suva at Nausori. The population of the island comprises mostly Indians and Melanesians with concentrations of other ethnicities in the urban areas.
