Lolland,  island of Denmark, in the Baltic Sea. It is separated from southern Zealand by Smålandsfarvandet Sound. Lolland has an area of 480 square miles (1,243 square km). The fourth largest island of the Danish archipelago, its irregular coastline is broken by Sakskøbing and Nakskov fjords. There are forests in the north and east, and the marshy southern coastal regions are protected from flooding by sand dunes and dikes. The island’s fertile clay loams support a thriving sugar-beet industry. Ålholm Castle in Nysted was a royal residence in the 12th century and now houses a Veteran Car Museum. Many fine manor houses and estates survive from as early as the 15th century, chief among them Knuthenborg (1866; with a zoological garden) and Christianssæde (1690). The principal towns are Nakskov, Maribo, Sakskøbing, Rødby, and Nysted. Rødbyhavn is the site of a major ferry line to Germany.
