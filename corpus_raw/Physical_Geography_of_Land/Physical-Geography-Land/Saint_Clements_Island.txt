Saint Clements Island, also called Blakiston Island or Blackistone Island,  islet (40 acres [16 hectares]) in the Potomac River, St. Mary’s county, southern Maryland, U.S., just off Coltons Point. The first Maryland settlers under the Calverts (Barons Baltimore) landed there from the ships Ark and Dove on March 25, 1634. A large cross (erected 1934) marks the site of the arrival of these Roman Catholic colonists and of the celebration of their first mass prior to their founding of St. Marys City. Mementos are in the St. Clement’s Island Museum, on the mainland at Coltons Point. The island is a state park.
