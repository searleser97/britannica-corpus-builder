Pentecost, also called Pentecôte, formerly Aragh, or Raga,  island of Vanuatu, in the southwestern Pacific Ocean, about 60 miles (100 km) southeast of Espiritu Santo island. Volcanic in origin, it occupies 169 square miles (438 square km) and has a central mountain ridge that rises to 3,104 feet (946 metres) at Mount Vulmat. Many permanent streams flow down the eastern slopes into fertile valleys, where copra and coffee are cultivated. Pentecost is known for a fertility ritual performed (usually at various times from April through May) to guarantee a good yam harvest; “land divers” jump headfirst from towers up to 80 feet (24 metres) tall that are made of bush timber and vines. The divers are suspended only by vines, short and springy enough to break their fall, attached to the tower and to their ankles. Careful planning allows them to just brush the ground and survive these plunges, which are said to have inspired the modern sport of bungee jumping. The island has one hospital and has airstrips at Lonorore in the southwest and Sara in the north.
