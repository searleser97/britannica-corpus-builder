Long Beach,  island and township in Ocean county, eastern New Jersey, U.S. It lies in the Atlantic Ocean 4–6 miles (6–10 km) offshore and shelters Little Egg Harbor and the southern portion of Barnegat Bay (both part of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway) from the ocean.
Extending 12 miles (19 km) southward from historic Barnegat Lighthouse (rebuilt in 1858; 165 feet [50 metres] high and near the scene of more than 200 shipwrecks in sailing-ship days), the narrow island includes a string of resorts, notably Loveladies (where there is a Foundation of Arts and Sciences), Harvey Cedars (Long Beach’s oldest community; settled just after the War of 1812 and subsequently inhabited by whalers), Surf City, Ship Bottom (bridged to the mainland), Brant Beach, and Beach Haven (near the southern tip), which is known for its Surflight Theatre. Long Beach was incorporated as a township in 1899. The island is a popular place for summer cottages and art colonies and has facilities for bathing, surfing, fishing, and boating. Pop. (2000) 3,329; (2010) 3,051.
