Baker Island, formerly New Nantucket Island or Phoebe Island,  unincorporated territory of the United States in the South Pacific Ocean, about 1,650 miles (2,650 km) southwest of Honolulu. A coral atoll rising to 25 feet (8 metres), it measures 1 mile (1.6 km) long by 0.7 mile (1.1 km) wide and has a land area of about 0.6 square mile (1.5 square km). The reef-fringed island is visited by more than a dozen species of seabirds and shorebirds, as well as threatened and endangered sea turtles, and is a U.S. National Wildlife Refuge.
In 1825 Capt. Obed Starbuck of the American whaling ship Loper recorded sighting the island. In 1832 it was sighted by another American mariner, Capt. Michael Baker. The United States claimed it (1857) along with nearby Howland Island under the Guano Act of 1856, but its guano deposits were exhausted by 1891. In the 1930s, rising interest in transpacific aviation prompted the United States to strengthen its claim on Baker by colonizing it from Hawaii. In 1936 it came under the administration of the U.S. Department of the Interior. Evacuated in early 1942 during World War II, the island was reoccupied by Allied forces in late 1943, and an air base was built. The island is now uninhabited except for periodic visits by scientists and by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, under whose jurisdiction it has been since 1974. In 2009 Baker Island was designated part of the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument.
