Bass Rock,  small island at the entrance of the Firth of Forth, northeast of the town of North Berwick, East Lothian council area, Scot. A weathered “plug” of volcanic material circular in shape, one mile in circumference and 350 feet (105 metres) high, Bass Rock rises precipitously from the sea, making access virtually impossible. It is a famous resting place for colonies of seabirds, notably solan geese. Now uninhabited, Bass Rock earlier functioned as both a hermitage (7th century) and a prison (17th century).
