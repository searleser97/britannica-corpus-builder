Mona Island, Spanish Isla Mona,  island lying west of Puerto Rico. It is in the centre of the Mona Passage about 45 miles (70 km) west of Mayagüez. About 6 miles (10 km) long, 4 miles (6.5 km) wide, and 20 square miles (52 square km) in area, the island is a limestone plateau. There is little vegetation, though there has been some reforestation. Despite the island’s excellent beaches and fishing, attempts by the Puerto Rican government to promote tourism have not succeeded. Guano was collected commercially until about 1920. The island has no permanent inhabitants.
