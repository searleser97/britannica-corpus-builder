Roti Island, Indonesian Pulau Roti,  island about 10 miles (16 km) southwest of Timor across the narrow Roti Strait, Nusa Tenggara Timur provinsi (province), Indonesia. Roti lies between the Indian Ocean on the west and the Timor Sea on the east. It is 50 miles (80 km) long (southwest-northeast) and about 14 miles (23 km) wide and has an area of 467 square miles (1,210 square km). The island is generally level, with hills in the central portion covered with hardwood forests.
Heavy rainfall and the warm humid climate favour cultivation of rice, corn (maize), fruits, and vegetables. Cattle and ponies are raised, and fishing is important. Sustainable tourism is a growth industry, as many visitors seeking the “Bali of yesterday” flock to Roti as an alternative to the more heavily developed Indonesian islands. The island is densely populated, and Protestantism is the dominant religion. The principal settlement and port is Baa on the northwestern coast; it is linked by road with Nembrala on the southern tip of the island. Trade (by boat) is mainly with nearby Timor.
