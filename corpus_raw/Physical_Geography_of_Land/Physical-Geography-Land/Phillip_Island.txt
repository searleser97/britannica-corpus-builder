Phillip Island,  island astride the entrance to Western Port (bay) on the south coast of Victoria, Australia, southeast of Melbourne. About 14 miles (23 km) long and 6 miles (10 km) at its widest, the island occupies 40 square miles (100 square km) and rises to 360 feet (110 metres). Visited in 1798 by the English explorer George Bass, it was originally called Snapper Island and then Grant Island, after Lieutenant James Grant, who landed there in 1801, and was renamed in honour of Captain Arthur Phillip, first governor of New South Wales. Sealers and whalers were in residence by 1802. It was proclaimed a shire in 1928. The island, the main town of which is Cowes, supports stock grazing and chicory cultivation and is a growing resort and retirement centre. It is the site of a koala bear sanctuary; seal, muttonbird, and little blue (fairy) penguin rookeries (the penguins’ daily parades between ocean and nest have become Victoria’s premier tourist attraction); a tropical aquarium; and a wildlife park. The island is bridged to San Remo, on the eastern (mainland) shore of Western Port.
