Bruny Island,  island in the Tasman Sea, lying off the southeastern coast of Tasmania, Australia, from which it is separated by the D’Entrecasteaux Channel (west) and Storm Bay (northeast). With an area of 140 sq mi (362 sq km) the 35-mi- (55-km-) long island is divided into northern and southern sections joined by a narrow isthmus. Deeply indented by Adventure, Cloudy, and Great Taylor bays and generally wooded, the island has a rugged east coast and rises to mountains in the south, one of the highest being Mt. Bruny (1,659 ft [506 m]). The Friars Rocks lie just offshore to the south. It was first sighted in 1642 by the Dutch navigator Abel Tasman and in 1792 was named by the French explorer Adm. Bruni d’Entrecasteaux, who navigated the coastal waters. Soon after settlement the island became a whaling base. In the 20th century it slowly lost its population. Bruny is crossed by a road from Dennes Point south to Cape Bruny, linking the settlements of Simpsons and Adventure bays, Alonnah, and Lunawanna. While some farming continues, Bruny now serves largely as a holiday destination and tourist attraction, with visitors arriving from nearby Hobart via a ferry from Kettering.
