Santa Cruz Island, also called Indefatigable Island or Chaves Island,  second largest of the Galapagos Islands, in the eastern Pacific Ocean about 600 miles (965 km) west of mainland Ecuador. It is roughly circular in shape, has a central volcanic crater that rises to 2,300 feet (700 metres), and covers an area of 389 square miles (1,007 square km). Puerto Ayora, on the southern coast, originally a colony of Scandinavians and Germans, has a harbour that can accommodate boats. Subsistence farming, fruit and sugarcane cultivation, and cattle raising are the basic economic activities, and tourism is important. The Charles Darwin Research Station on the island conducts scientific studies on how to preserve the Galapagos ecosystem.
