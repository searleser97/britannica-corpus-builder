Shevaroy Hills,  outlying range of the Eastern Ghats, north-central Tamil Nadu state, southern India. The Shevaroy Hills occupy an area of about 150 square miles (390 square km). The highest peaks are in the southwest, reaching 5,231 feet (1,594 metres) at Sanyasimalai (Duffâ€™s Hill) on the Yercaud plateau. Widespread bauxite deposits are the basis for aluminum-processing plants at Mettur and Yercaud. Coffee is extensively grown on the plateau. In 1845 the British established a hill station at Yercaud, which is now a resort and educational centre.
