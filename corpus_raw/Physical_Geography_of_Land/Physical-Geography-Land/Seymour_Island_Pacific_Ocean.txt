Seymour Island,  one of the smaller (area 1 sq mi [3 sq km]) of the Galapagos Islands, in the eastern Pacific Ocean directly north of Baltra Island, about 600 mi (965 km) west of mainland Ecuador. A large colony of land iguanas has been imported from Baltra because of the islandâ€™s better food supply. There is no human population.
