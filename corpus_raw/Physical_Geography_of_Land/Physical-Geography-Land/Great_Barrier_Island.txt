Great Barrier Island,  island marking the northeastern corner of Hauraki Gulf/Tīkapa Moana, eastern North Island, New Zealand. Separated from the Coromandel Peninsula (south) by Colville Channel, it is the largest island off North Island, with a total land area of 110 square miles (285 square km). Its mountainous surface rises to volcanic Mount Hobson (Hirakimata), 2,038 feet (621 metres).
Known to the Māori as Aotea, the island was named by Capt. James Cook (1769). Earlier mining has been replaced by sheep and dairy farming. Now chiefly used as a summer resort, Great Barrier Island is accessible by launch from Auckland (55 miles [88 km] southwest) to Tryphena, on the south coast, and Port Fitzroy, on the west.
