Martha’s Vineyard,  island of glacial origin off the southeastern coast of Massachusetts, U.S., 4 miles (6 km) across Vineyard Sound from the mainland (Cape Cod). It accounts for most of the territory and population of Dukes county, Massachusetts.
The island is some 20 miles (32 km) long and 2–10 miles (3–16 km) wide and rises 311 feet (95 metres) above sea level at its highest point. Its coastline is characterized by numerous inlets and ponds sealed by sand spits from the sea. It was probably sighted by many early navigators but was first recorded in 1602 by Bartholomew Gosnold and Gabriel Archer; the two explorers named it for its many vines and for Martha, Gosnold’s daughter. Purchased by Thomas Mayhew in 1641 and settled the following year, it was considered part of New York but was ceded in 1692 to Massachusetts. In 1695 it was incorporated into Dukes county (along with the Elizabeth Islands [west], Chappaquiddick Island [east], and the island called Nomans Land [or No Man’s Land; southwest]). Early attempts at farming, brickmaking, and fish smoking gave way in the 18th and 19th centuries to the development of whaling and fishing enterprises based at Edgartown (incorporated 1671), which once boasted the world’s largest sperm-oil candle factory.
The economy now depends on summer yachting and tourism. Martha’s Vineyard is divided among the resort towns (townships) of Tisbury (with Vineyard Haven), Oak Bluffs, Edgartown, West Tisbury, Chilmark, and Aquinnah (formerly [until 1997] Gay Head, so named for the multicoloured cliffs found there). Descendants of Wampanoag Indians that inhabited the island in the 17th century now live in Aquinnah, which features a historic lighthouse (1799; rebuilt in the 1850s). Martha’s Vineyard State Forest is at the centre of the island. Area county, 104 square miles (269 square km). Pop. county (2000) 14,987; (2010) 16,460.
