Javadi Hills,  range of hills, one of the larger of the Eastern Ghats, in northern Tamil Nadu state, southeastern India. About 50 miles (80 km) wide and 20 miles (32 km) long, they are bisected into eastern and western sections by the Cheyyar and Agaram rivers, tributaries of the Palar River. They consist of bluish gray granites, with peaks averaging from 3,600 to 3,800 feet (1,100 to 1,150 metres). Their steep southeastern flanks are forested with sandalwood. The hills are sparsely populated. Grains, legumes, and oilseeds are the chief crops.
