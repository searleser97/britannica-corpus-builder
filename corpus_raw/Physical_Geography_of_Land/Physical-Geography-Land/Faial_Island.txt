Faial Island, formerly Fayal Island, Portuguese Ilha do Faial,  island forming part of the Azores archipelago of Portugal, in the North Atlantic Ocean. Its area of 67 square miles (173 square km) was increased by 1 square mile (2.5 square km) because of volcanic activity in 1957–58. The centre of the island consists of a perfectly shaped volcano, Mount Gordo. Faial (meaning “beech wood”) was named for the wax myrtle, once abundant, which its discoverers mistook for beech trees. A small valley, Flamengos, recalls the Flemish settlers who colonized the island in the 16th century.
The women of Faial produce fine lace from agave thread, execute carvings in snow-white fig-tree pith, and weave fine baskets. Grains, fruit, and olives are grown, and cattle raising and dairying are other important economic activities. The town of Horta is Faial’s main seaport and has an international airport. Other towns of importance include Cedros and Feteira.
