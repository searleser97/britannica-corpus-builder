Mafinga Hills,  hills located astride the Malawi-Zambia border southeast of Chitipa (Fort Hill), Malawi. The hills are composed of quartzites, phyllites, and feldspathic sandstones of sedimentary origin. Three separate sections—the Mafingi Ridge, Pilewombe Hills, and Kayuni-Misissi Hills—were formed by the erosional action of the Mbalizi, Lufilya, and North Rukuru rivers. The craggy quartzite ridges, crowning steep, grassy slopes and deep gullies, rise to elevations of more than 7,000 feet (2,130 metres).
