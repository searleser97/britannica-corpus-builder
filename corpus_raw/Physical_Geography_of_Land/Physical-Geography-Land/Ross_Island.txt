Ross Island,  volcanic formation in Antarctica, located in the western Ross Sea, Ross Dependency (New Zealand), at the northern margin of the Ross Ice Shelf, just off the coast of Victoria Land. The island is 43 miles (69 km) long and 45 miles wide. On it are Mount Erebus (an active volcano 12,450 feet [3,800 metres] high) and Mount Terror (10,750 feet) among a series of mountain ranges intersected by deep valleys. Mount Erebus was the site in 1979 of a crash that claimed 257 lives on a sightseeing and photographic flight over Antarctica. The ranges are free of snow except for hanging glaciers on the highest slopes. McMurdo, a U.S. base, is located on the island just north of Cape Armitage, its southernmost extremity. About one mile south is Scott Base, a New Zealand station. A steep pyramid of rock called Observation Hill rises between the two stations. In 1907 Ernest Shackleton, a British explorer, established a camp at Camp Royds, and Robert Falcon Scott, in 1910, set up a camp at Cape Evans on his return expedition. These are now maintained as historic monuments.
