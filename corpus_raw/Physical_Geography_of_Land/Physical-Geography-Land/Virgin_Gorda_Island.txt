Virgin Gorda Island,  one of the British Virgin Islands, in the West Indies, lying 80 miles (130 km) east of Puerto Rico. It forms two rectangles joined by a spit, or point, of land. The peninsula in the southwest is flat and strewn with enormous granite boulders, some more than 30 feet (9 metres) high. The north rises straight from the water to hills, the highest of which is Virgin Peak at 1,359 feet (414 metres).
Virgin Gorda was settled by planters leaving Anguilla after 1680. Agriculture is economically important, as is tourism. There were once copper workings at Copper Mine Point. Area 8.25 square miles (21 square km). Pop. (2000) 3,203; (2010) 3,930.
