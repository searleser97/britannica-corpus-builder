Penrhyn Atoll, also called Tongareva,  most northerly of the Cook Islands, a self-governing state in free association with New Zealand in the South Pacific Ocean. A coral atoll, it has a 40-mile (64-km) reef that surrounds a lagoon of 108 square miles (280 square km).
Penrhyn was inhabited by Polynesians at the time of its discovery (1788) by a British ship, the Lady Penrhyn, which was taking convicts to Australia.

The large lagoon has good anchorage facilities with three passages to the open sea. Penrhyn has several schools, a hospital, and an airstrip, which was built during World War II. Some staple goods are brought in by ship from Rarotonga, but fish are abundant and coconut and breadfruit are grown. Area (land only) 3.8 square miles (9.8 square km). Pop. (2006) 254; (2011) 213.
