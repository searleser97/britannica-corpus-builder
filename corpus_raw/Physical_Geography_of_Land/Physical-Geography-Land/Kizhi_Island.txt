Kizhi Island,   island in Lake Onega, Karelia republic, northwestern Russia. The island, whose name originates from kizharsuari (“island of games”), was located on the important 14th-century trade route from the town of Novgorod to the White Sea. The settlement grew around the Spasskiy Church that was founded in the mid-16th century. In the 17th century, the island served as a defense post against Swedish and Polish invasions. During the reign of Catherine II the Great, several major peasant revolts took place in Kizhi between 1769 and 1771.
Today the island is best known for its Museum Site of History and Architecture (opened 1960), where early wooden barns, houses, a windmill, and several churches were collected and restored as part of an open-air museum. The Preobranzhenskaya (Transfiguration) Church (1714), 121 feet (37 m) in height, with its three tiers and 22 cupolas, is often compared to St. Basil’s Cathedral in Moscow’s Red Square. The Preobranzhenskaya houses a collection of iconostases (each a screen or partition with doors and tiers of icons used to separate the altar from the nave in Eastern churches). The Pokorovskaya (Intercession) Church (1764) has 10 cupolas, and its interior is decorated with icons made locally in the 17th and 18th centuries. St. Lazarus, the oldest church (built 1390) in the Karelian republic, was transported to the open-air museum from the Murom Monastery in the Pudozh region and restored in 1961. Tourism is Kizhi’s major industry.
