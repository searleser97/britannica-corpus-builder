Atafu,  coral atoll of Tokelau, a territory of New Zealand in the South Pacific Ocean. It comprises 19 islets that rise to 15 feet (5 metres) above sea level and enclose a lagoon measuring 3 miles (5 km) by 2.5 miles (4 km). Discovered (1765) by British navigator John Byron, who named it Duke of York Island, Atafu was Christianized (1858) by the London Missionary Society. Despite heavy rainfall, fresh water is scarce, and islanders depend upon coconuts and marine life for subsistence. Shipping is hampered by a lack of good anchorages. Local administration consists of a Taupulega (Council of Elders), made up of heads of family groups and two elected members. Area 1.4 square miles (3.5 square km). Pop. (2006) 417.
