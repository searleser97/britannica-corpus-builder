Rakahanga Atoll,  one of the northern Cook Islands, a self-governing state in free association with New Zealand in the South Pacific Ocean. It is a sparsely populated rectangular coral atoll 3 miles (5 km) long comprising eight islets. Rakahanga has also been known as Grand Duke Alexander Island, Reirson Island, and Little Ganges Island.
Rakahanga was inhabited by Polynesian people for hundreds of years before its discovery in 1606 by the Portuguese navigator Pedro Fernández de Quirós. It was annexed to Great Britain (1889) and later placed under New Zealand administration (1901).
The lagoon, protected from the open sea by a reef, can be entered through either of two passages. Pearl farms have been established in the lagoon. Fishing, notably for tuna, is a major subsistence activity, and coconuts and coconut crabs are other staples of the islanders’ diet. Efforts are being made to conserve the local sea turtle population. The atoll relies on solar power for its energy needs. Rakahanga has a school, a church, and a meeting hall. The extremely low-lying atoll was believed in the early 21st century to be under threat from rising sea levels caused by climate change. Area (land only) 1.6 square miles (4.1 square km). Pop. (2006) 127; (2011) 77.
