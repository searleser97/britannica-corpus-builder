Mainland, also called Pomona,  central and largest of the Orkney Islands of Scotland, which lie off the northern tip of the Scottish mainland. The shores of this irregularly shaped island are deeply indented (from north and south, respectively) by the inlets of Kirkwall Bay and Scapa Flow, reducing its width to less than 2 miles (3 km) at one point. Ward Hill, the highest point on the low-lying island, has an elevation of only 881 feet (269 metres). Progressive agriculture—grounded in use of the most modern technology and dedicated to safe fieldwork and safe products—is practiced widely in the area. There are numerous lakes well stocked with trout. The island shows signs of very early occupation, including the Neolithic village of Skara Brae, the great barrow (earthwork) of Maeshowe tumulus, the Standing Stones of Stenness, the Ring of Brodgar stone circles, and such monoliths as the Stone of Odin; these locations and others collectively were designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1999. Kirkwall, the administrative centre of the Orkneys, and Stromness, situated on the west coast, are the only towns. The former British naval base of Scapa Flow, where the German navy surrendered after World War I, lies to the south. Pop. (2001) 15,339.
