Pukapuka Atoll, also called Danger Atoll,  one of the northern Cook Islands, a self-governing state in free association with New Zealand in the South Pacific Ocean. A coral formation, it comprises three islets—the main islet of Pukapuka (also called Wale) and the uninhabited Motu Kavata and Motu Koe.
Inhabited by Polynesian people for hundreds of years before its first sighting (1595) by a European, the Spanish explorer Álvaro de Mendaña, Pukapuka was ‘‘rediscovered’’ (1765) by the English navigator John Byron. He called it Isle of Danger because the high surf and dangerous rocks prevented him from landing. In 1863 Peruvian slavers arrived and took some 145 people. Pukapuka was annexed by Great Britain in 1892. Its elevation is unusually high for an atoll, rising to 100 feet (30 metres) at one place. The atoll has a hospital and school. The islets of Motu Kavata and Motu Koe are used for market gardening, and fish are abundant in the waters surrounding the atoll. Area (land only) 0.5 square mile (1.3 square km). Pop. (2006) 507; (2011) 451.
