Whakaari/White Island,  island in the Bay of Plenty, 43 miles (69 km) west of Cape Runaway, eastern North Island, New Zealand. An active volcano, it is the top of a submarine vent at the northern end of the Taup≈ç-Rotorua Volcanic Zone. With a total land area of about 1,000 acres (400 hectares), it rises to 1,053 feet (321 metres) at Mount Gisborne. Scrub vegetation is common on much of the island.
The island was sighted and named by Capt. James Cook in 1769. It has numerous hot springs, geysers, and fumaroles; its last eruption, which took place in December 2019, claimed the lives of 21 individuals. Whakaari/White Island is uninhabited, but it was accessible for tourists by charter launch from Tauranga (52 miles [84 km] southwest) and by helicopter. At the time of the December 2019 eruption, 47 people (adventure tourists and guides) were on the island. In the aftermath of the tragedy, visits to the island were suspended.
