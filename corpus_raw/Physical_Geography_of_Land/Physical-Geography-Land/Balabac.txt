There are coral reefs off its western coast, and the island is particularly noted for its rare glory-of-the-seas cone shells. Philippine territory ends at the southwestern corner of the island, where small motorized canoes operated by Balabac Muslims make frequent border crossings to the nearby islands in Sabah state (Malaysia) off Borneoâ€™s northern coast. Coconuts are a major crop on Balabac. Its people are mostly Muslim (Moros). Balabac town is the main centre of settlement. Pop. (2000) 25,257; (2010) 35,758.
