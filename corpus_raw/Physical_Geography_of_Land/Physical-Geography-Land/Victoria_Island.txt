Victoria Island,  second largest island in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Divided administratively between the Northwest Territories and the territory of Nunavut, it is separated from the mainland on the south by Dolphin and Union Strait, Coronation Gulf, Dease Strait, and Queen Maud Gulf. It is about 320 miles (515 km) long and 170–370 miles (270–600 km) wide, with an area of 83,896 square miles (217,291 square km). The terrain rises from a deeply indented coast to about 2,150 feet (655 m) in the northwest.
The island’s sparse population is concentrated chiefly in the settlements of Holman in the west and Cambridge Bay (Ikaluktutiak; the site of a weather station) in the southeast. Discovered in 1838 by Thomas Simpson, the island was named for Queen Victoria and was first explored by John Rae in 1851.
