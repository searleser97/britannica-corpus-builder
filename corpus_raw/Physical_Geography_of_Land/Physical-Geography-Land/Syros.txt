Syros, Modern Greek Síros,  island near the centre of the Cyclades (Modern Greek: Kykládes) group, in the Aegean Sea, South Aegean (Nótio Aigaío) periféreia (region), southeastern Greece. Its chief town and port, Hermoúpolis, on a bay of the east coast, is the capital of the nomós (department) of Cyclades. The island is hilly, denuded, and irregular in shape, and it reaches an elevation of 1,450 feet (442 metres). The old quarter, Áno Síros, of Hermoúpolis was founded in the 13th century by Venetians on the site of a Classical town. Refugees from the War of Greek Independence (1821–29) founded the adjacent contemporary port, which was important in Greek coastal trade. Industries include shipbuilding, tanning, cotton mills, weaving, and confectionery, but the main source of revenue is from maritime trade and commercial shipping.
