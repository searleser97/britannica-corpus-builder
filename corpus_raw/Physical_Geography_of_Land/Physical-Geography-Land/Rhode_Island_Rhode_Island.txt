Rhode Island, also called Aquidneck Island,  island, largest in Narragansett Bay, eastern Rhode Island, U.S., occupying an area of 44 square miles (114 square km). Aquidneck is the Indian name for what was later called Rhode Island. The source of the modern name is unclear: it either was given by colonist Roger Williams, thinking it was the island (Block Island) the Italian navigator Giovanni da Verrazzano had seen in 1524, or it was named by Dutch explorer Adriaen Block in 1614. Known to American colonists by its Indian name, northern Aquidneck was the site of the Battle of Rhode Island between American forces and the British in 1778. A nearby memorial honours the black soldiers of the First Rhode Island Regiment who took the brunt of the British attack.
Basically rural in character, Rhode Island includes two towns (townships), Portsmouth and Middletown, and a city, Newport.
