Bora-Bora,  volcanic island, Îles Sous le Vent (Leeward Islands), in the Society Islands of French Polynesia. It lies in the central South Pacific Ocean, about 165 miles (265 km) northwest of Tahiti. The mountainous island, some 6 miles (10 km) long and 2.5 miles (4 km) wide, has Mount Otemanu (Temanu; 2,385 feet [727 metres]) and twin-peaked Mount Pahia (2,159 feet [658 metres]) as its highest peaks. It is surrounded by coral reefs. On the west side of Bora-Bora is a large lagoon in which the smaller islands of Toopua and Toopua Iti protect a spacious harbour, popular with yachtsmen. Vaitape, the principal village and administrative centre, is on the west coast.
The island’s name—the Tahitian spelling of which is Porapora—means “First Born”; according to tradition, it was the first island created after Raiatea. Bora-Bora was sighted by Dutch admiral Jacob Roggeveen in 1722, visited by Capt. James Cook in 1769 and 1777, and annexed by France in the late 19th century. During World War II the island had an Allied naval base, and the islet of Mute, on the northwest side of Bora-Bora’s reef, was an Allied air base; the airport is still in use. Tourism is Bora-Bora’s primary economic activity. Chief products include copra, vanilla, and mother-of-pearl. Area 14.7 square miles (38 square km). Pop. (2017) 10,605.
