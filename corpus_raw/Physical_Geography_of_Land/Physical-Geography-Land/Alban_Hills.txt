Alban Hills, Italian Colli Albani or Monti Albani,  volcanic area in the Lazio (Latium) regione (region) of central Italy, southeast of Rome. The hills consist of an outer circle, 6–8 miles (10–13 km) in diameter, rising to 3,113 feet (949 metres) at Mount Cavo, and an inner crater rim, about 1.5 miles (2 km) across, rising to 3,136 feet (956 metres) at Mount Faete. Lakes Albano and Nemi occupy two of the craters. Even before the emergence of Rome as a great power, the Alban Hills were a place sacred to the people of Latium. Roman roads, temples, villas, and theatres are still partly preserved there. Because of their coolness in summer and the absence of malaria, the hills for centuries have been a favourite summer resort of Romans. The Alban vineyards produce the popular wines known as Castelli Romani (after the towns of the district). An electric suburban railway connects Rome with the hill retreats of Frascati, Grottaferrata, Albano, Velletri, Genzano, and Castel Gandolfo (the papal summer residence).
