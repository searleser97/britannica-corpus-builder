Prince Edward Island,   one of the two Prince Edward Islands (the other being Marion Island) in the southern Indian Ocean. The subantarctic island lies about 1,200 miles (1,900 km) southeast of Cape Town and 12 miles (19 km) north-northeast of Marion Island and covers an area of 18 square miles (47 square km). Discovered in January 1772 by the French explorer Marion du Fresne, the island was given its present name by the British navigator James Cook, who explored the area in 1776. In the 19th and 20th centuries it was frequented by whaling ships and seal hunters. South Africa claimed the island in 1947, annexing it in 1948. Prince Edward Island is volcanic in origin. It has steep escarpments on its northwest and southwest coasts, rising to 2,370 feet (722 m) in the centre of the island. The climate is cool and stormy; dominant westerly winds bring heavy rain (on an average of 300 days a year) and snow. The mean annual temperature is 40° F (4.4° C); yearly rainfall averages 100 inches (2,500 mm). Plants include the Kerguelen cabbage, peculiar to that part of the world. The island is uninhabited except for occasional biological research teams.
