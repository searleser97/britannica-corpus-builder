Bathurst Island,  island in the Timor Sea, Northern Territory, Australia. It is separated from Melville Island to the east by Apsley Strait and from the mainland by Beagle Gulf. Melville and Bathurst are administered jointly as the Tiwi Islands. The islands are located approximately 50 miles (80 km) northwest of Darwin. Nguiu, on Bathurst’s southeast coast, is the largest settlement and unofficial capital of the Tiwi Islands.
Densely wooded, Bathurst Island is triangular and has an area of about 1,000 square miles (2,600 square km). Like Melville Island, it has been inhabited for at least 7,000 years by the Aboriginal Tiwi people. After several sightings and occasional landings by Europeans (who were met with hostility from the Tiwi), the island was explored in 1818 by Phillip Parker King, who named it for the 3rd Earl Bathurst, the British secretary for war and the colonies (1812–27). In 1910 it became the site of a large Roman Catholic mission to the Tiwi. Bathurst and Melville islands were declared Aboriginal reserves in 1911 and 1933, respectively, and 1941 they were designated as a reserve collectively..
In 1942 the island was the target of Japan’s first bombing attack against Australia during World War II. In 1978 ownership of the island passed from the crown to the Tiwi Land Council of tribal representatives. The Tiwi Islands Local Government was formed in 1998 to govern Melville and Bathurst islands. Cattle and varied crops are raised, and forestry and aquaculture ventures have been developed to provide revenue. Pop. (2011) Tiwi Islands local government area, 2,580; (2016) Tiwi Islands local government area, 2,453.
