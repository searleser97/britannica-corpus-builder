Manihiki Atoll, formerly Humphrey’s Island,  one of the northern Cook Islands, a self-governing state in free association with New Zealand in the South Pacific Ocean.  The name Manihiki sometimes also refers to the entire group of the northern Cooks.
Manihiki, a coral atoll 2.5 miles (4 km) across, is made up of dozens of small islets. It was inhabited by Polynesian people for several hundred years before its discovery by U.S. mariners (1822). It was often visited by whalers during the 19th century. In 1888 Great Britain declared a protectorate over the Cook Islands, which were subsequently annexed by New Zealand in 1901. The two main islets are Tauhunu and Tukao. Export of pearl shell and high-quality copra is complicated by the lack of passage into the lagoon, but there are anchorages at Tauhunu and Tukao. Fishing and the farming of oysters for cultured black pearls are the atoll’s main economic activities. Area (land) 2.1 square miles (5.4 square km). Pop. (2006) 344; (2011) 238.
