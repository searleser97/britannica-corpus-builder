Villegagnon Island, Portuguese Ilha De Villegagnon,  island in Guanabara Bay, southeastern Brazil, connected by a causeway to Rio de Janeiro’s Santos Dumont Airport on the mainland. In 1555 French Huguenots from nearby Laje Island under Nicolas Durand de Villegaignon established the colony of La France Antarctique and Fort Coligny. In 1560 the fort was destroyed by Portuguese troops, and the Huguenots were forced to abandon the island. Villegagnon is the site of Brazil’s National Naval Academy.
