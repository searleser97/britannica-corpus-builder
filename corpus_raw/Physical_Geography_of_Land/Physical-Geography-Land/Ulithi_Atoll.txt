Ulithi Atoll, also called Mackenzie Islands,  coral atoll, Federated States of Micronesia, in the western Pacific Ocean. It comprises roughly 40 islets and has a total land area of 1.75 square miles (4.5 square km).
Ulithi was probably sighted by the Portuguese in 1526, but it remained undisturbed by Europeans until 1731, when it was visited by Spanish Jesuit missionaries led by Juan Antonio Cantova. During World War II it was the site of a Japanese seaplane base until it was captured in 1944 by Allied forces; it served as a large U.S. naval base for the duration of the war and as a military radio outpost for several years thereafter. The atollâ€™s inhabitants are probably of mixed Polynesian and Micronesian heritage and speak Ulithian, an Austronesian language..
