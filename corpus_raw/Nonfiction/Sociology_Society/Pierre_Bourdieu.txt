Pierre Bourdieu,  (born August 1, 1930, Denguin, France—died January 23, 2002, Paris), French sociologist who was a public intellectual in the tradition of Émile Zola and Jean-Paul Sartre. Bourdieu’s concept of habitus (socially acquired dispositions) was influential in recent postmodernist humanities and social sciences.
Bourdieu was born into a working-class family in southern France. He attended a secondary school in Pau before transferring to a more prestigious school in Paris. He was later admitted to the École Normal Supérieure, where he studied philosophy under Louis Althusser. He then taught at a lycée in Moulins (1954–55).
Bourdieu was drafted into the army, and in 1955 he was sent to Algeria, where he later worked as a lecturer and researcher at the University of Algiers (1958–60). While there he engaged in ethnographic research, particularly among the Berber-speaking Kabyle. Bourdieu’s experience in Algeria resulted in Sociologie de l’Algérie (1958; The Algerians), which established his reputation. He returned to France and taught at the University of Paris (1960–61) and the University of Lille (1961–64) before taking a position at the École Pratique des Hautes Études in 1964. At the latter school he established the Centre for the Sociology of Education and Culture. In 1981 he became the chair of sociology at the Collège de France.
In his best-known work, La Distinction (1979; Distinction), Bourdieu argued that those with high social and cultural capital (or status) are the arbiters of taste and thatone’s own particular taste comes from the milieu and social class in which one lives—that is, one’s field. An individual’s almost innate knowledge of how to live in and navigate that field is what he termed habitus. His other important works included Esquisse d’une théorie de la pratique (1972; Outline of a Theory of Practice), Le Sens pratique (1980; The Logic of Practice), La Noblesse d’état (1989; The State Nobility), and Sur la télévision (1996; On Television). From 1975 Bourdieu was editor of the journal Actes de la recherche en sciences sociales, and in 1989 he founded the review Liber.
Beginning in the 1980s, Bourdieu inserted himself into the public realm, supporting the rights of the unemployed, the homeless, and immigrants without papers. He spoke out against globalization and neoliberalism and often commented on political situations. A 2001 documentary film about Bourdieu, La Sociologie est un sport de combat (“Sociology Is a Combat Sport”), was a surprise hit in France.
