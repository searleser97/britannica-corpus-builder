Dicky Wells, Dicky also spelled Dickie, byname of William Wells,  (born June 10, 1907/09, Centerville, Tennessee, U.S.—died  November 12, 1985, New York City, New York), leading American jazz trombonist who was noted, especially in the big band era, for his melodic creativity and expressive techniques.
Wells began playing trombone in his youth in Louisville, Kentucky, and at about age 20 he moved to New York City, becoming a member of the Lloyd Scott band. He became noted for his playing while a member of New York bands, including ones led by Charlie Johnson, Benny Carter, and Fletcher Henderson, before working (mid-1930s) with Teddy Hill, with whom he played in Europe. His longest tenure was with the Count Basie band (1938–50, with some interruptions). For most of the rest of his career he was a freelance trombonist who worked often with other former Basie sidemen, most notably Buddy Tate and Earle Warren.
Wells possessed a full, rich trombone tone with a distinctive broad vibrato. The character of his phrasing resulted from the trombone’s unique construction; his lines often featured expansive but rhythmically simple phrasing, enhanced by grace notes and portamenti. He was a melodic improviser who typically structured his solos around contrasts of rhythmic character. Among his outstanding solos are “Sweet Sue, Just You” and “Arabesque” with Spike Hughes; “Dickie’s Dream” and “Taxi War Dance” with Basie; and the 1937 small-group recordings he led in Paris that included guitarist Django Reinhardt, “Hangin’ Round Boudon” and “Sweet Sue” among them.
The grandeur of Wells’s earlier art gradually dissipated after the early 1940s, to be replaced by broad humour, yet he retained his swing and much of his melodic wit. He played on the 1958 TV show Jazz Party and performed with Ray Charles (1961–63). His final album, Lonesome Road, appeared in 1981. The Night People is his reminiscences, written in collaboration with Stanley Dance (1971).
