Norman Cousins,  (born June 24, 1912, Union Hill, N.J., U.S.—died  Nov. 30, 1990, Los Angeles, Calif.), American essayist and editor, long associated with the Saturday Review.
Cousins attended Teachers College, Columbia University, and began his editorial career in 1934. From 1942 to 1972 he was editor of the Saturday Review. Following his appointment as executive editor in 1940, he introduced essays that drew a connection between literature and current events, whereupon circulation of the magazine increased 50 percent. Unafraid to criticize, Cousins was outspoken and his articles sometimes bitter. At times he criticized the U.S. government, but he felt strongly that a unique potential for greatness existed in America; he wrote The Good Inheritance: The Democratic Chance (1942) to explore this idea. Cousins felt modern problems stemmed from the absence of a collective voice and from Americans’ inability to see their social and political dilemmas clearly. In 1972 Cousins left the Saturday Review but returned the following year. In 1980 he was named “editor emeritus.” In his final years he was adjunct professor of psychiatry and biobehavioral science at the University of California at Los Angeles.
Cousins wrote on a variety of subjects, including a biography of Albert Schweitzer and a book of reflections on mankind in the atomic age, Modern Man Is Obsolete (1945). In 1979 Anatomy of an Illness appeared, a book based on Cousins’ own experience with a life-threatening illness and exploring the healing ability of the human mind. Later works include Human Options (1981), The Physician in Literature (1982), and The Pathology of Power (1987).
