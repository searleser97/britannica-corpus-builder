George Smith,  (born March 19, 1824, London—died  April 6, 1901, Byfleet, near Weybridge, Surrey, Eng.), British publisher, best known for issuing the works of many Victorian writers and for publishing the first edition of the Dictionary of National Biography.
Smith’s father, also named George Smith (1789–1846), learned bookselling in his native Scotland and, after moving to London, joined with another Scot, Alexander Elder, in founding (1816) what became Smith, Elder & Co., booksellers and stationers; in 1819 they also became publishers. The young Smith was born over the shop, came to know the business intimately, and, upon his father’s death in 1846, took sole control (Elder and a later third partner having left the firm).
For more than 30 years Smith was the friend and publisher of the novelist and critic John Ruskin, and it was with him that Charlotte Brontë found a publisher for Jane Eyre. The firm issued works by Charles Darwin, William Makepeace Thackeray, Robert and Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Wilkie Collins, Matthew Arnold, Harriet Martineau, James Payn, Anthony Trollope, and Mrs. Humphry Ward. In January 1860 the first of George Smith’s three great undertakings was begun, the illustrated literary journal Cornhill Magazine being issued in that month under the editorship of Thackeray. The second venture was the founding in 1865 of the Pall Mall Gazette, a paper described as “written by gentlemen for gentlemen.” The third and most important was the publication of the Dictionary of National Biography, the first volume of which was issued in 1885, it was completed in 1901, in 66 volumes, and this monumental work was the crowning effort of a successful career.
After 1894 Smith did leave the main control of the business in the hands of his younger son, Alexander Murray Smith (who retired from the partnership in 1899), and his youngest daughter’s husband, Reginald John Smith (1857–1916), who from 1899 was sole active partner and who, in 1908, rearranged the original 66 volumes of the Dictionary of National Biography into 22. (In 1917 the Dictionary was given to the University of Oxford—its supplements to be continued by the Oxford University Press.)
