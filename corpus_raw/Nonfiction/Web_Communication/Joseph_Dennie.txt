Joseph Dennie,  (born Aug. 30, 1768, Boston, Mass. [U.S.]—died Jan. 7, 1812, Philadelphia, Pa.), essayist and editor who was a major literary figure in the United States in the early 19th century.
Dennie graduated from Harvard College in 1790 and spent three years as a law clerk before being admitted to the bar in 1794. His practice failed to flourish, however, and in the meantime he had turned to writing. He and Royall Tyler formed a literary partnership under the pseudonyms Colon and Spondee, and together they began contributing satirical pieces to local newspapers. Between 1792 and 1802 Dennie wrote his periodical “Farrago” essays. For the Farmer’s Weekly Museum, a well-known newspaper of Walpole, N.H., he wrote the series of graceful, moralizing “Lay Preacher” essays that established his literary reputation. He served as editor of the Farmer’s Weekly from 1796 to 1798.
The strong pro-Federalist bias of Dennie’s editorship and of his “Lay Preacher” essays secured him an appointment as personal secretary to Secretary of State Timothy Pickering in 1799. He thus moved to Philadelphia, but his job ended when Pickering was dismissed by President John Adams in 1800. Undaunted, Dennie, with Asbury Dickins, began in 1801 a politico-literary periodical called The Port Folio, which became the most distinguished literary weekly of its time in America. He contributed his own “Lay Preacher” essays and commissioned original manuscripts from Thomas Campbell, Leigh Hunt, and Thomas Moore, among other prominent writers and poets. As the founder of the Tuesday Club, Dennie was the centre of the aristocratic literary circle in Philadelphia and was for a time the leading literary arbiter in the country. He derided native American rusticity and crudity and opposed all democratic innovations while praising English literature, manners, and sophistication. He also advocated sound critical standards and encouraged such talented younger writers as Washington Irving.
