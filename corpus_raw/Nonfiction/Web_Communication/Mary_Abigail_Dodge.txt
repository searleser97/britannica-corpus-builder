Mary Abigail Dodge, pseudonym Gail Hamilton,  (born March 31, 1833, Hamilton, Mass., U.S.—died Aug. 17, 1896, Hamilton),  American essayist and editor whose writings included works both of homely wit and in ardent support of women’s independence from men.
In 1850 Dodge graduated from the Ipswich (Massachusetts) Female Seminary, and she remained there as a teacher until 1854. She taught elsewhere until 1858, when she moved to Washington, D.C., to become governess to the children of Gamaliel Bailey. The editor of the antislavery journal National Era, Bailey had earlier received a few of her poems and prose sketches for publication. These writings began to appear also in various other periodicals under the pseudonym Gail Hamilton and to attract considerable attention for their practical wisdom and wit.
From 1860 to 1868 Dodge cared for her ailing mother. During that time she published two collections of essays, Country Living and Country Thinking (1862) and A New Atmosphere (1865), and a strong defense of women’s right to equal educational and occupational opportunities, Woman’s Wrongs: A Counter-Irritant (1868). She also edited a juvenile magazine, Our Young Folks, with Lucy Larcom and John T. Trowbridge in 1865–67. Her Battle of the Books (1870) was a witty fictional account of her disagreements with her first publisher, Ticknor and Fields of Boston.
From 1871 Dodge spent much time in Washington, D.C., mainly in the household of James G. Blaine, whose wife was her cousin, but she also traveled extensively in the United States and Europe. Her articles and essays remained in great demand. Subsequent books by Gail Hamilton include Woman’s Worth and Worthlessness (1872), Our Common School System (1880), and X Rays (1896). In 1872–73 she helped edit Wood’s Household Magazine.
