Rose O’Neal Greenhow, née Rose O’Neal,  (born c. 1815, probably Montgomery county, Md., U.S.—died Oct. 1, 1864, near Wilmington, N.C.),  Confederate spy whose social position and shrewd judgment cloaked her espionage for the South during the American Civil War.
Rose O’Neal married the prominent physician and historian Robert Greenhow in 1835 and became a leading hostess of Washington, D.C. She was a confidante of several powerful political figures, notably John C. Calhoun and James Buchanan, and a party to various intrigues, especially those of the Cuban general Narciso López. In 1850 the Greenhows moved to Mexico City and then to San Francisco. After her husband’s death in 1854, Greenhow returned to Washington, D.C. Although she was a Southerner who had long been staunchly pro-slavery, she remained in Washington after the outbreak of the Civil War.
Greenhow was soon recruited as a Confederate spy. In July 1861 she secured and forwarded information about the movements of General Irvin McDowell’s army toward Manassas Junction, Virginia. In August she was arrested by Allan Pinkerton, head of the Union secret service, and confined to her home. She somehow managed to continue sending information from there and, after her incarceration in January 1862, even from Old Capitol Prison. In March she was examined by a War Department commission, and in June she was exiled south. Greeted as a heroine in the Confederacy, she was handsomely rewarded by President Jefferson Davis. In August 1863 she sailed for Europe as an unofficial agent of the Confederacy, and later that year she published her prison diary, My Imprisonment and the First Year of Abolition Rule at Washington. On October 1, 1864, weighed down by gold sovereigns, she drowned upon the sinking of a small boat in which she was attempting to run the federal blockade of Wilmington, North Carolina.
