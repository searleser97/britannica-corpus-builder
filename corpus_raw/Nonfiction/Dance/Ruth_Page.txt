Ruth Page,  (born March 22, 1899, Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S.—died April 7, 1991, Chicago, Illinois), American dancer and choreographer, who reigned as the grand dame of dance in Chicago from the 1920s to the 1980s.
Page’s father was a brain surgeon and her mother a pianist, and both encouraged her desire to dance, sending her to study with local teachers and, in 1914, introducing her to the Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova, a house guest. The young Page appeared briefly with Pavlova’s company that year. She moved to Chicago, appeared in Adolph Bolm’s The Birthday of the Infanta (1919), and for several years toured as premiere danseuse with Bolm’s Ballet Intime company, appearing in his Le Coq d’Or (1925) and in the premiere of Apollon Musagète (1928). She performed with Serge Diaghilev’s avant-garde Ballets Russes and had ballets choreographed for her by George Balanchine.
In 1925 Page married a wealthy Chicago lawyer and made Chicago her home base. She founded numerous companies, notably the Chicago Opera Ballet (later Ruth Page’s International Ballet), which flourished from 1956 to 1970; was director and choreographer after 1965 for an annual Christmas-season production of The Nutcracker in Chicago; and in 1970 founded the Ruth Page Foundation School of Dance. Page’s choreographic credits included more than 100 works, among them Revanche (1951), Villa (1953), and Die Fledermaus (1958). In 1962 Soviet dancer Rudolf Nureyev made his U.S. debut with her company in New York City. Page, who continued to attend a dance class each day until she was 87 years old, also wrote two books, Page by Page (1978) and Class (1984).
