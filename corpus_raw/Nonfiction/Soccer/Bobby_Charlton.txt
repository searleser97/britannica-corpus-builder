Bobby Charlton, byname of Sir Robert Charlton,  (born October 11, 1937, Ashington, Northumberland, England), football (soccer) player and manager who is regarded as one of the greatest English footballers. From 1957 to 1973 he made a total of 106 international appearances for England—a national record at the time.
A forward on the Manchester United team from 1954 until he retired in 1973, Charlton survived an airplane crash (near Munich, West Germany, on February 6, 1958) in which eight Manchester United regulars were killed. His inspired play then led his team, composed chiefly of reserves, to the Football Association Cup final match that year. He played on the English national team that won the World Cup in 1966 and was voted European Footballer of the Year for his efforts. Charlton captained Manchester United when they were the first English club to win the European Cup (now known as the Champions League) in 1968. In addition to these notable victories, he also led Manchester to three First Division league championships (1957, 1965, 1967).
After his retirement from United, Charlton managed the Preston North End team (1973–75) and was later director of the Wigan Athletic Football Club. In 1984 Charlton became a member of the Manchester United board of directors. A noted ambassador of the game, he played a prominent role in a number of English World Cup and Olympic Games bids, including the successful London 2012 Olympic Games campaign. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1994.
Charlton was the author of My Soccer Life (1965), Forward for England (1967), My Manchester United Years: The Autobiography (2007), My England Years: The Autobiography (2008), and other books.
