Sir Rudolf Bing,  (born January 9, 1902, Vienna, Austria—died September 2, 1997, Yonkers, New York, U.S.), British operatic impresario who oversaw the Metropolitan Opera in New York City for 22 years (1950–72) as general manager.
The son of an Austrian industrialist, Bing grew up in a musical household and studied at the University of Vienna. He first worked in theatrical agencies casting singers for opera houses. From 1928 to 1935 he assisted Carl Ebert in managing opera companies in Germany and England. In 1935 Bing was appointed general manager of the Glyndebourne Opera Company. In 1947 he helped found the Edinburgh Festival, establishing it as a major European festival.
Three years later Bing was appointed general manager of the Metropolitan Opera Company in New York City. During Bing’s tenure he improved standards of performance and production and was especially praised for his attention to scenic design. He shaped the repertoire to ensure success at the box office and was therefore often criticized for his musical taste: Italian Romantic operas became the mainstay, while Baroque and 20th-century works were rarely programmed. He concentrated on attracting singers of international fame but neglected to retain conductors of equal stature, which resulted in some lackluster performances. Bing’s imperious and autocratic manner contributed to the conflicts that flared during his successful and tempestuous career at the Met.
Bing was knighted in 1971 and wrote two memoirs, 5,000 Nights at the Opera (1972) and A Knight at the Opera (1981).
