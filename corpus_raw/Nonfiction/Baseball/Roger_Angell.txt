Roger Angell,  (born September 19, 1920, New York, New York, U.S.), American author and editor who is considered one of the best baseball writers of all time.
Angell was a fiction editor at The New Yorker, the magazine in which most of his essays on baseball first appeared. A lifelong baseball fan, he grew up in New York City watching the New York Giants and New York Yankees play in the 1930s and reading about the games in the daily newspapers. While critics have labeled Angell a baseball historian and essayist, he sees his writing as the autobiography of himself as a fan. He has combined his passion for writing with his love of baseball, and his prose exhibits a detailed understanding of—and enthusiasm for—the game. Because they are not game accounts written to meet a deadline, his pieces on baseball are in-depth, are detailed, and have a timeless feel to them.
Although Angell had been writing professionally since the mid-1940s, he did not produce his first baseball article until 1962; published in The New Yorker, “The Old Folks Behind Home” describes his visit to spring training in Florida. For decades Angell has delighted readers of The New Yorker with his springtime essays. In 1972 he published The Summer Game, a collection of the baseball writing he did for the magazine between 1962 and 1971. Five more collected volumes, Five Seasons (1977), Late Innings (1982), Season Ticket (1988), Once More Around the Park (1991), and Game Time (2003), cover his baseball writings up to 2002. He also wrote a full-length biography, A Pitcher’s Story: Innings with David Cone (2001), and a memoir, Let Me Finish (2006). This Old Man: All in Pieces (2015) is a multitudinous collection of writings on various topics, arranged around a 2014 New Yorker essay about entering his ninth decade.
Angell was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2007. In December 2013 Angell was named the winner of the 2014 J.G. Taylor Spink Award, the highest baseball-writing honour given by the Baseball Writers Association of America, which entails recognition in a permanent exhibit in the Baseball Hall of Fame.
