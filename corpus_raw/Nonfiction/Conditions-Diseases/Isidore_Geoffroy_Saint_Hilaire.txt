Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire,  (born Dec. 16, 1805, Paris, Fr.—died  Nov. 10, 1861, Paris), French zoologist noted for his work on anatomical abnormalities in humans and lower animals.
In 1824 Geoffroy joined his father at the National Museum of Natural History as an assistant naturalist, and, after taking his M.D. in 1829, he taught zoology from 1830 to 1833. He was elected a member of the Academy of Sciences in Paris in the latter year. In his Histoire générale et particulière des anomalies de l’organisation chez l’homme et les animaux, 4 vol. (1832–37; “General and Particular History of Structural Monstrosities in Man and Animals”), he introduced the term teratology for the study of congenital abnormalities.
Geoffroy succeeded his father in 1837 in Paris as professor of comparative anatomy at the Faculty of Sciences and, in 1841, at the National Museum of Natural History. He organized the Faculty of Sciences at Bordeaux in 1838 and served as inspector general of the University of Paris in 1844 and as a member of the royal council for public instruction the same year. In 1854 he founded the Société d’Acclimatation to study how animals adjust to different climates and in 1856 was elected president of the Academy of Sciences in Paris. In 1847 he published a scientific biography of his father, Vie, travaux, et doctrine scientifique d’Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (“Life, Works, and Scientific Principles of Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire”).
