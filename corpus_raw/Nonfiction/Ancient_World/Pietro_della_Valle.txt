Pietro della Valle,  (born April 11, 1586, Rome—died April 21, 1652, Rome), Italian traveler to Persia and India whose letters detailing his wanderings are valuable for their full descriptions.
Valle vowed to make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and on June 8, 1614, he sailed from Venice for Istanbul, where he remained a year, learning Turkish and Arabic. On Sept. 25, 1615, he left for Jerusalem by way of Alexandria, Cairo, and Mount Sinai. After visiting the holy sites, he proceeded to Damascus and Baghdad, where he married a Syrian Christian woman, and to Eṣfahān, Persia (now in Iran), which he reached early in 1617. He attended the court of Shāh ʿAbbās I and then resumed his journey with his wife. She died at Persepolis, Persia (1621), and Valle transported her embalmed remains with him on his journey. He reached Surat in northwestern India in 1623 and, for about a year, continued southward along the coast to Calicut (Kozhikode). By way of Basra, in southern Mesopotamia, and the desert route to Aleppo, Syria, Valle finally reached Rome on March 28, 1626.
In Rome he was appointed a gentleman of the bedchamber by Pope Urban VIII. He recorded his travels in a series of letters published in three volumes: Turkey (1650), Persia (1658), and India (1663).
