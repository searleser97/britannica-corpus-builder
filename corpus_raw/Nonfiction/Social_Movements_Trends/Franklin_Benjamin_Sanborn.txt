Franklin Benjamin Sanborn,  (born December 15, 1831, Hampton Falls, New Hampshire, U.S.—died  February 24, 1917, Plainfield, New Jersey), American journalist, biographer, and charity worker.
A descendant of an old New England family (its progenitor first immigrating in 1632), Sanborn attended Phillips Exeter Academy and Harvard College (B.A., 1855). In 1855 he settled in Concord, Massachusetts, then an intellectual centre, and also became active in the abolitionist cause, becoming John Brown’s New England agent. He tried to dissuade Brown from attempting the raid on the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry, but he nevertheless aided the firebrand with funds. The U.S. Senate early in 1860 tried—through a summons and then orders for arrest—to get him to testify about his role, and for two months he was partly on the run, until the Massachusetts Supreme Court protected him from seizure.
Sanborn had already begun a career in journalism, and in 1863 he became an editor of the Boston Commonwealth; in 1867 he joined the staff of the Springfield Republican (Springfield, Massachusetts), with which he remained until 1914. Concurrently, from 1863 to 1888 he served several times on the state board of charities, working for prison reform, care of the insane, and other welfare measures.
In his years at Concord, Sanborn came to know many of the luminaries of literary New England. Among his many writings are Henry D. Thoreau (1882), The Life and Letters of John Brown (1885), A. Bronson Alcott: His Life and Philosophy, 2 vol. (1893; with W.T. Harris), Ralph Waldo Emerson (1901), Hawthorne and His Friends (1908), Recollections of Seventy Years, 2 vol. (1909), and The Life of Henry David Thoreau (1917).
