Alphonse-Marie Bérenger, in full Alphonse-marie-marcellin-thomas Bérenger,  (born May 31, 1785, Valence, France—died  March 9, 1866, Paris), French magistrate and parliamentarian, distinguished for his role in the reform of law and legal procedure based on humanitarian principles.
Appointed judge in Grenoble in 1808, Bérenger had a successful career in the magistracy during Napoleon’s First Empire and served as a representative for Drôme département during Napoleon’s return in the Hundred Days. In 1818 he published De la justice criminelle en France (“On Criminal Justice in France”), in which he attacked the special courts of the royal Restoration and demanded the institution of trial by jury.
Bérenger was elected deputy for Valence in 1827 and kept this mandate for 12 years. As a member of the Court of Cassation from 1831, he took part in all juridical discussions, notably in the revision of the criminal code and in securing for juries the right to find extenuating circumstances in crimes. Although he withdrew from political activities, Bérenger remained active as counselor and then as president of one of the chambers of cassation until 1860. He served as president of the high court of Bourges, judging political trials during the Second Republic. In his most important work, De la répression pénale, comparaison du système pénitentiaire en France et en Angleterre (1853; “On Penal Repression, a Comparison of the Penitentiary System in France and in England”), he defended humanitarian principles in the administration of justice.
