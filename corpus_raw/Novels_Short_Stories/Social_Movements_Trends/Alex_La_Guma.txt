Alex La Guma,  (born Feb. 20, 1925, Cape Town, S.Af.—died  Oct. 11, 1985, Havana, Cuba), black novelist of South Africa in the 1960s whose characteristically brief works (e.g., A Walk in the Night [1962], The Stone-Country [1965], and In the Fog of the Season’s End [1972]) gain power through his superb eye for detail, allowing the humour, pathos, or horror of a situation to speak for itself.
La Guma was reared in a family active in the black liberation movement. In 1960 he joined the staff of the progressive newspaper New Age. During the next few years he was detained and imprisoned several times for his antiapartheid activities. The South African government banned his writing and speaking, and in 1966 he and his family moved to London, where he lived in exile until 1979. In his later years he served as the representative of the African National Congress in Cuba.
His first novel, A Walk in the Night, presents the struggle against oppression by a group of characters in Cape Town’s toughest district and, in particular, the moral dissolution of a young man who is unjustly fired from his job. Its general theme of protest is reiterated in And a Threefold Cord (1964), which depicts the degrading effect of apartheid upon a ghetto family, and in The Stone-Country, which grew out of La Guma’s experiences in prison. His short stories appeared in many anthologies and magazines. The novel Time of the Butcherbird appeared in 1979. La Guma’s high reputation is based on his vivid style, his colourful dialogue, and his ability to present sympathetically and realistically people living under sordid and oppressive circumstances.
