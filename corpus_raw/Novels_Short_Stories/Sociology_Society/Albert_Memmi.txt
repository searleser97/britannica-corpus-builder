Albert Memmi,  (born December 15, 1920, Tunis, Tunisia—died May 22, 2020, Paris, France), French-language Tunisian novelist and author of numerous sociological studies treating the subject of human oppression.
Memmi was the product of a poor Jewish section of the capital city of Tunisia, but he studied at an exclusive French secondary school there. He thus found himself, early in his life, in the anomalous position of a Jew among Muslims, an Arab among Europeans, a ghetto dweller among the bourgeoisie, and an évolué (one “evolved” in French culture) among tradition-bound family and friends. It was this tension of living in several worlds at once that became the subject of Memmi’s autobiographical first novel, La Statue de sel (1953; “The Pillar of Salt”), a work for which he received the Prix de Carthage and the Prix Fénéon. Subsequent novels included Agar (1955), which deals with the problem of mixed marriage; Le Scorpion (1969), an intricately structured tale of psychological introspection; and Le Désert (1977), in which violence and injustice are seen as age-old responses to the pain and uncertainty of the human condition.
Memmi’s most influential sociological work was Portrait du colonisé (1957; “Portrait of the Colonized”), an analysis of the situations of both the colonizer and the colonized, who contribute to their own entrapment in their respective roles. Among Memmi’s other studies of human oppression are his two-part Portrait d’un Juif (1962 and 1966; “Portrait of a Jew”) and L’Homme dominé (1968; “Dominated Man”), a collection of essays examining the situations of women, blacks, and other traditionally dominated groups. Memmi contributed to North African literature as a critic as well as an author, in part through his establishment and direction of a research group on North African literature at the École Pratique des Hautes Études in Paris, where he also taught sociology at the Université de Paris.
