Mikhail Yevgrafovich, Count Saltykov, pseudonym N. Shchedrin,  (born Jan. 27 [Jan. 15, old style], 1826, Spas-Ugol, Russia—died  May 10 [April 28, O.S.], 1889, St. Petersburg), novelist of radical sympathies and one of greatest of all Russian satirists.
A sensitive boy, he was deeply shocked by his mother’s cruel treatment of peasants, which he later described in one of his most important works, Poshekhonskaya starina (1887–89; “Old Times in Poshekhona”). In 1838 he was sent to the Imperial Lycée at Tsarskoye Selo (now Pushkin), Russia’s training ground for high officers of state, where he began to compose and publish verses. Reacting violently against its bureaucratic regime, he joined the revolutionary circles in St. Petersburg and met the critic Vissarion Belinsky.
In 1847 he began his literary career as a reviewer in the radical periodicals Sovremennik (“The Contemporary”) and Otechestvennye zapiski (“Notes of the Fatherland”). As a result of the sympathy he expressed for French utopian socialists in his story Zaputannoye delo (1848; “A Complicated Affair”), he was exiled to Vyatka (now Kirov), where he worked in the provincial governor’s office. After he returned to St. Petersburg in 1855, he published his first successful book, Gubernskiye ocherki (1856–57; selections in English translation, Tchinovnicks. Sketches of Provincial Life, 1861), in which he satirized Vyatka officials. In 1857 he wrote his only comedy, Smert Pazukhina (performed 1893; The Death of Pazukhin, 1924), about Russian merchants.
From 1858 he served as a provincial vice governor of Ryazan and then Tver and as president of the taxation boards at Penza, Tula, and Ryazan, successively. In 1862 Saltykov retired from government service and devoted himself to literature. He was editor of Sovremennik and then joined the radical poet Nikolay Nekrasov as co-editor of Otechestvennye zapiski, becoming editor after Nekrasov’s death (1878). His major works include Istoriya odnogo goroda (written 1869–70; “History of One Town”) and Pompadury i pompadurshi (written between 1863 and 1874; “Pompadours and Pompadouresses”), two biting satires on the highest Russian officials. His last works include a novel that traces the falling fortunes of a family of landed gentry, Gospoda Golovlyovy (1876; The Golovlyov Family, 1955); and Skazki (1880–85; Fables, 1931), a trenchant commentary on society.
