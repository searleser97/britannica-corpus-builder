Károly Eötvös, Hungarian form Eötvös Károly,  (born March 11, 1842, Mezőszentgyörgy, Hung.—died April 13, 1916, Budapest), Hungarian writer, lawyer, and politician best known as the defense counsel in a notorious case related to anti-Semitism.
After studying law in Budapest, Eötvös became a notary in Veszprém, where he founded a weekly newspaper that attracted the attention of Hungarian statesman Ferenc Deák. With Deák’s help Eötvös became the editor of the influential newspaper Pesti Napló (“Pest Journal”) and then a member of the National Assembly. In 1878 he joined the opposition Independence Party and set up a law firm in Budapest. In 1883 he represented the defendants in the widely publicized Tiszaeszlár case, in which local Jews were accused of using the blood of a murdered Christian girl for preparing matzo. His success in that case earned him an international reputation, though in Hungary he was the subject of widespread criticism. After a three-year break, he was elected to the National Assembly again in 1887; in 1893 he left the Independence Party to form his own party, but he succeeded in gaining reelection only as an independent candidate. After his 1910 candidacy was unsuccessful, he retired from public life.
He left behind numerous short stories, essays, and memoirs. Among his best-known works are Utazás a Balaton körül (1901; “Journey Around the Balaton”) and A Bakony (1909; “The Bakony”). His most significant writing was a three-volume description of the Tiszaeszlár case, A nagy per, mely ezer éve folyik (1904; “The Great Trial Going on for a Thousand Years”). His collected works were published from 1901 to 1909 in 24 volumes.
