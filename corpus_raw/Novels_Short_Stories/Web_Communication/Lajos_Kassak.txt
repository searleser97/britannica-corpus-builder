Lajos Kassák,  (born March 21, 1887, Érsekújvár, Hungary, Austria-Hungary [now Nové Zámky, Slovakia]—died July 22, 1967, Budapest, Hungary), poet and novelist, the first important Hungarian working-class writer.
At the age of 20 Kassák began traveling on foot throughout Europe and so gained a cosmopolitan outlook. A pacifist during World War I, he founded the journal Tett (“Action”) in 1915 to express his views. He was also a socialist, and he welcomed the short-lived communist regime of Béla Kun in Hungary in 1919. After its collapse, Kassák emigrated to Vienna, where he edited a journal of radical opinion, Ma (“Today”).
Kassák published several novels and volumes of poetry, but his most important work is his long (eight-volume) autobiography, Egy ember élete (1928–39; “A Man’s Life”). He generally found favour with the communist government of post-World War II Hungary, although this government deleted from later editions of Kassák’s autobiography the final chapters dealing with his growing disenchantment with communism. In the more relaxed atmosphere that followed the 1956 revolution in Hungary, Kassák’s image was reevaluated, and in the last decade of his life he enjoyed full official recognition.
