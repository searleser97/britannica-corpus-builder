Mary Mapes Dodge, in full Mary Elizabeth Mapes Dodge,  (born Jan. 26, 1831, New York, N.Y., U.S.—died Aug. 21, 1905, Onteora Park, N.Y.), American author of children’s books and first editor of St. Nicholas magazine.
As the daughter of an inventor and scientist, Mapes grew up in an environment where such prominent men as William Cullen Bryant and Horace Greeley were entertained. At 20 she married William Dodge, a lawyer, and they had two sons. To maintain her independence after she was suddenly widowed seven years later, she started writing children’s stories. Her first collection, Irvington Stories (1864), centred on the American colonial family. Its success prompted her publisher to request another. The following year Dodge’s beloved classic, Hans Brinker: or, The Silver Skates, appeared. The tale of an impoverished Dutch boy whose determination enabled him to obtain help for his sick father went through more than 100 editions during the author’s lifetime.
In 1868 Dodge became associate editor of Hearth and Home, with Harriet Beecher Stowe and Donald Grant Mitchell (“Ik Marvel”). In 1873, in the midst of an economic depression, Dodge was asked to become editor of a new publishing venture, the children’s magazine St. Nicholas. Its subsequent success stemmed from Dodge’s high literary and moral standards. Her editorial excellence enabled St. Nicholas to attract such well-known contemporary writers as Mark Twain, Bret Harte, Lucretia Peabody Hale, Louisa May Alcott, Robert Louis Stevenson, Frances Hodgson Burnett, and Rudyard Kipling.
