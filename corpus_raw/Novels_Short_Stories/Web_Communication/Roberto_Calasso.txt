Roberto Calasso,  (born 1941, Florence, Italy—died July 28, 2021, Milan), Italian editor, publisher, and writer whose book Le nozze di Cadmo e Armonia (1988; The Marriage of Cadmus and Harmony) achieved international critical and popular acclaim.
While a student at the University of Rome, where he received a degree in English literature, Calasso began working for Adelphi Edizioni, a publisher of classic and modern literature. He married novelist Fleur Jaeggy and became managing director and managing editor of Adelphi. His first novel, L’impuro folle (1974; “The Impure Madman”), is an emotive presentation of madness, written in lyrical styles from comic to epic and from arcane to popular. Calasso started what he considered a work in progress with the publication of his second novel, La rovina di Kasch (1983; The Ruin of Kasch). It is a chaotic text built on an ancient African legend of the kingdom of Kasch and its decline after it abandons its traditional ritual sacrifice of the king. The second volume, The Marriage of Cadmus and Harmony, retells classic Greek myths in an attempt to evoke the primal meanings they once conveyed—the absolute and arbitrary power of nature and existence as embodied in the gods. In 1996 he published Ka (Eng. trans. Ka), in which he treated Indian mythology.
