Bernardas Brazdžionis, pseudonym Vytė Nemunėlis,  (born February 14, 1907, Stebeikėliai, Lithuania, Russian Empire—died July 11, 2002, Los Angeles, California, U.S.), leading Lithuanian poet, editor, critic, and—under his pseudonym—author of popular children’s books.
Brazdžionis studied Lithuanian language and literature at the University of Kaunas (1929–34) and showed originality with his third collection of verse, Amžinas žydas (1931; “The Eternal Jew”); his first two collections were written while he was still in high school. He taught Lithuanian, worked for a book publisher, and in 1940 was appointed director of the Maironis Museum of Literature in Kaunas. Near the end of World War II, with Soviet occupation imminent, he left Lithuania (1944) for Germany. In 1949 he moved to the United States and settled in Boston, where he worked as the editor of world literature for Lietuvių enciklopedija (“Lithuanian Encyclopaedia”). Six years later he became editor of the Lithuanian cultural magazine Lietuvių dienos (“Lithuanian Days”), published in Los Angeles.
A poet of great range, Brazdžionis moved surely from romanticism to realism, from local themes to universal ones; at times he was lyrical and serene, at others dramatic and stormy. Although his style is largely traditional, his poetry departs from that mold in his use of language: word order is broken up, words and sounds repeated. At the centre of his poetry lies his faith in God and in his providence. Brazdžionis’s earlier religious poetry, written in Lithuania, has biblical themes and is marked by his use of liturgical language. After Lithuania lost its independence during World War II, patriotic and humanistic themes became dominant in his poetry.
Brazdžionis’s verse for children is among the best and most popular in Lithuanian literature. He also edited several anthologies of Lithuanian literature.
