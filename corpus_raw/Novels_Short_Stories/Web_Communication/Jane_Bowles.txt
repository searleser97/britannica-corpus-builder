Jane Bowles, in full Jane Sydney Bowles, née Auer,  (born Feb. 22, 1917, New York, N.Y., U.S.—died May 4, 1973, Malaga, Spain), American author whose small body of highly individualistic work enjoyed an underground reputation even when it was no longer in print.
She was raised in the United States and was educated in Switzerland by French governesses. She married the composer-author Paul Bowles in 1938. They lived in Costa Rica, France, Mexico, and the United States, where she began writing her only published novel, Two Serious Ladies (1943). For a time the couple lived in a boardinghouse with, among others, the writers Richard Wright and Carson McCullers, the composer Benjamin Britten, and the entertainer Gypsy Rose Lee. The couple settled in Tangier, Morocco, in 1952. In December 1953 her play In the Summer House was staged in New York. In addition to the novel and the play, she also published seven short stories.
Bowles deliberately constructed Two Serious Ladies without a plot. Its title characters, one sinful and victimized, the other virtuous and domineering, meet only twice; their lives are presented alternately, in a style praised for its wit. Her short stories and play also contrast domineering and weak women. Her Collected Works was published in 1966; it was expanded after her death and published as My Sister’s Hand in Mine (1978).
