Jack Cope, byname of Robert Knox Cope,  (born June 3, 1913, Mooi River, South Africa—died May 1991, Stevenage, Hertfordshire, England), South African writer best known for his short stories and novels about South African life.
Cope became a journalist in Durban and then in London. Unwelcome in England by 1940 because of his pacifism, he returned to South Africa to farming, shark fishing, and writing fiction. The Fair House (1955), a family history centring on the Zulu revolt of 1902, was the first of a series of novels that includes The Golden Oriole (1958), The Road to Ysterberg (1959), Albino (1964), The Dawn Comes Twice (1969), The Student of Zend (1972), and My Son Max (1977). Among his short-story collections are The Tame Ox (1960), The Man Who Doubted (1967), and Alley Cat (1973).
Cope’s writing is always credible and lucid and shows genuine insight into the varied classes, races, and individuals who populate his fiction. Sometimes criticized as overly sensitive to the demands of South African society and to the evils he acknowledged in it, he nevertheless chose to live and write in South Africa rather than seek the independence exile might have given him. Yet this same sensitivity was essential to the scope, skill, and morality of his art. In any case, he did not entirely, in spite of care, avoid censorship. The Dawn Comes Twice was (belatedly) banned in the late 1970s. He founded and for many years edited the bilingual journal Contrast and edited and translated the works of many other writers. In 1982 Cope published The Adversary Within: Dissident Writers in Afrikaans.
