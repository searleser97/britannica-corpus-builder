Nina Berberova, in full Nina Nikolayevna Berberova,  (born August 8, 1901, St. Petersburg, Russia—died September 26, 1993, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.), Russian-born émigré writer, biographer, editor, and translator known for her examination of the plight of exiles.
Berberova left the Soviet Union in 1922 and lived in Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Italy as part of Maxim Gorky’s entourage before settling in Paris in 1925. While living in Europe she served as coeditor of the literary journal Novy dom (1926; “New House”) and as literary editor of the weekly Russkaya mysl (1948–50; “Russian Thought”). Although she wrote four novels, including Posledneye i pervoye (1929; “The Last and the First”) and Povelitelnitsa (1932; “Female Sovereign”), she was more successful as a writer of short stories and novellas. Her cycle of stories entitled “Biyankurskiye prazdniki” (“Billancourt Holidays”) was published serially between 1928 and 1940 in Posledniye novosti and was published in the U.S.S.R. in 1989. Another collection is Oblegcheniye uchasti (1949; “The Easing of Fate”). She also wrote poetry and biographies.
Berberova moved to the United States in 1950 and later became a citizen. She worked as a language instructor and Voice of America radio announcer before embarking on a teaching career that included positions as lecturer at Yale University (1958–63) and professor of literature at Princeton University (1963–71). Her autobiography, The Italics Are Mine (1969), appeared in English first, then Russian. The Tattered Cloak (1991) is a collection of some of her early short stories translated into English. Three Novels (1990) and Three Novels: The Second Volume (1991) contain translations of her earlier writings in Russian. After her death, translations of her work continued to be published, including a biography, Aleksandr Blok (1996); three novellas in The Ladies from St. Petersburg (1998); and two novels, the autobiographical The Book of Happiness (1999) and Cape of Storms (1999). Among her own translations are works of Romain Rolland, Constantine Cavafy, and T.S. Eliot into Russian and of Fyodor Dostoyevsky into French.
