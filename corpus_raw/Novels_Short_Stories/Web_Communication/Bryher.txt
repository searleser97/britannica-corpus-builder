Bryher, byname of Annie Winifred Ellerman,  (born Sept. 2, 1894, Margate, Kent, Eng.—died  Jan. 28, 1983, Vevey, Switz.), British novelist, poet, and critic, best known for her historical fiction. She was also a cofounder and coeditor of Close-Up, an authoritative journal on silent motion pictures.
Bryher, the daughter of British shipping magnate Sir John Ellerman, traveled extensively throughout Europe, the Middle East, and the Mediterranean with her parents. She took the name Bryher (from her favourite of the Isles of Scilly) when she began to write because she did not want the eminent family name to influence publishers or critics. She was closely associated for most of her life with poet Hilda Doolittle.
Although Bryher wrote some poetry and nonfiction, among which was Film Problems of Soviet Russia (1929), it was her historical novels that brought her critical acclaim. These works include Beowulf (1948), The Fourteenth of October (1952), The Player’s Boy (1953), and Ruan (1960), all set in Britain at various historical eras; and The Roman Wall (1954) and The Coin of Carthage (1963), which are set in the Roman Empire. Bryher was notable for the vivid artistry with which she accurately re-created ancient cultures during periods of change, disorder, and conflict.
