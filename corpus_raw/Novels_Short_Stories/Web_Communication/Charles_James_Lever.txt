Charles James Lever,  (born Aug. 31, 1806, Dublin, Ire.—died  June 1, 1872, Trieste, Austria-Hungary [now in Italy]), Irish editor and writer whose novels, set in post-Napoleonic Ireland and Europe, featured lively, picaresque heroes.
In 1831, after study at Trinity College, Cambridge, he qualified for the practice of medicine. His gambling and extravagance, however, left him short of money despite his income and his inheritance, and he began to utilize his gifts as a raconteur. In 1837 The Confessions of Harry Lorrequer appeared serially in the Dublin University Magazine, where it was a definite success. His novel Charles O’Malley, which ranges from the west of Ireland to the Peninsular War, appeared in 1841; Jack Hinton and Tom Burke of “Ours,” a vigorous story of an Irishman in the service of the French empire, in 1843.
In 1842 Lever assumed the editorship of the Dublin University Magazine. He traveled to the European continent in 1845, visited resorts, and served as British consul at La Spezia and Trieste. He continued to write novels, among them The Knight of Gwynne (1847), Confessions of Con Cregan (1849), and Roland Cashel (1850). These novels mark a transition from the loosely constructed picaresque works of his youth to the less ebullient, more analytic manner of his last books, among which are The Fortunes of Glencore (1857) and Lord Kilgobbin (1872). Rough and ready though they are, the vivacity of his early novels, the picture they present of the devil-may-care, hard-riding gentry and their ragged adherents, and a down-to-earth Irish realism make them perennially attractive.
