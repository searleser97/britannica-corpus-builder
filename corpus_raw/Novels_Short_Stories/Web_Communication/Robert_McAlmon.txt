Robert McAlmon, in full Robert Menzies McAlmon,  (born March 9, 1896, Clifton, Kan., U.S.—died Feb. 2, 1956, Desert Hot Springs, Calif.), American author and publisher and an exemplar of the literary expatriate in Paris during the 1920s. Many of his short stories, however, are based on his own youthful experiences living in small South Dakota towns.
McAlmon attended the University of Minnesota for one semester before enlisting in the U.S. Air Corps in 1918. After World War I he attended the University of Southern California intermittently until 1920; then McAlmon moved to Chicago and soon to New York City. While in New York he and William Carlos Williams began the little magazine Contact. In 1921 McAlmon married the English writer Bryher (Annie Winifred Ellerman) and moved to Paris. After publishing a book of his short stories, A Hasty Bunch (1922), at his own expense, he founded his own publishing company; under the name Contact Editions, he published his short-story collection A Companion Volume (1923) and his loosely organized autobiographical novel Post-Adolescence (1923), as well as works by Williams, Gertrude Stein, Ernest Hemingway, and Bryher.
One of McAlmon’s best-received works is the novel Village: As It Happened Through a Fifteen Year Period (1924), a bleak portrait of the inhabitants of an American town presented in a series of sketches. His later books include Distinguished Air (Grim Fairy Tales) (1925), the poetry collection The Portrait of a Generation (1926), the 1,200-line epic poem North America, Continent of Conjecture (1929), the poetry collection Not Alone Lost (1937), and Being Geniuses Together: An Autobiography (1938), a Paris memoir to which his friend Kay Boyle added further chapters in a 1968 edition; it is considered one of McAlmon’s greatest contributions to literature. McAlmon and the Lost Generation: A Self-Portrait (1962) is a collection of his autobiographical writings.
