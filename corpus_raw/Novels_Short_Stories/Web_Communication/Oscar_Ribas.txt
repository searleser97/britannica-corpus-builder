Óscar Ribas, in full Óscar Bento Ribas,  (born August 17, 1909, Luanda, Angola—died June 19, 2004, Lisbon, Portugal), Angolan folklorist and novelist, who recorded in Portuguese the oral tradition of the Mbundu people of Angola.
The son of a Portuguese father and an Angolan mother, Ribas gradually went blind during his early 20s but remained an indefatigable researcher and writer. He began his literary career as a writer of romantic tales. The publication of Uanga-feitiço (1951; “The Evil Spell”) and Ecos da minha terra (1952; “Echoes of My Land”) marked a new African direction in his writing. The novel Uanga-feitiço follows the marriage of an African man and woman and presents a wealth of Mbundu fables, songs, and folk sayings. Ribas published an expanded version of the novel in 1969. Ecos da minha terra is a collection of stories based on legends and folktales.
Ribas’s study of Mbundu culture and religion, Ilundo: divindades e ritos angolanos (1958; “Ilundo: Angolan Divinations and Rites”), appeared after 18 years of research. It was followed by Missosso: literatura tradicional angolana, 3 vol. (1961–64; “Missosso: Traditional Angolan Literature”), a linguistic work containing a vernacular dictionary and Portuguese versions of Angolan tales (missosso), laments, and proverbs. Ribas’s autobiography, Tudo isto aconteceu (1975; “All of This Happened”), confirms Ribas’s attachment to an Angola in which blacks and whites live fraternally.
