Frederic Prokosch,  (born May 17, 1908, Madison, Wis., U.S.—died June 6, 1989, Plan-de-Grasse, France), American writer who became famous for his early novels and whose literary stature subsequently rose as his fame declined.
The precocious son of a respected linguist-philologist and a concert pianist, Prokosch spent his childhood in the United States, Germany, France, and Austria. By the age of 18 he had received an M.A. degree from Haverford (Pennsylvania) College (1926); he received a Ph.D. from Yale University (1933) and a second M.A. from the University of Cambridge (1937). Prokosch’s first novel, The Asiatics (1935), was the picaresque story of a young American who travels from Beirut, Lebanon, across vivid Asian landscapes to China, encountering a variety of distinctive individuals along the way; it won wide acclaim and was translated into 17 languages. His other novels of the 1930s—another journey-tale, The Seven Who Fled (1937), and Night of the Poor (1939)—were also well received. Meanwhile, with his own press, he published many of his poems. His fourth novel was one of his best known—The Skies of Europe (1941), which includes a portrait of Adolf Hitler as a failed artist.
During World War II, Prokosch was cultural attaché of the American Legation in Sweden, and he remained in Europe after the war. His reputation continued to flourish, and there he wrote most of his 16 novels, including two more journey-novels, Storm and Echo (1948) and Nine Days to Mukalla (1953), and The Missolonghi Manuscript (1968), a fictional biography of Lord Byron. He published four collections of poems and translated the poetry of Euripides, Louise Labé, and Friedrich Hölderlin. His final work, Voices (1983), was a memoir of his encounters with leading 20th-century literary figures, including T.S. Eliot and Thomas Mann, who were among his admirers.
