José Bianco,  (born November 21, 1908, Buenos Aires, Argentina—died April 24, 1986, Buenos Aires), novelist and editor for 23 years of the influential Buenos Aires magazine Sur, published by a group of important Argentine writers that included Jorge Luis Borges, Adolfo Bioy Casares, and Silvina and Victoria Ocampo. Launched in 1931, Sur carried translations of European and American authors and became one of the most important literary journals in the history of Latin America.
Bianco, who was a modest and unassuming man, published a collection of short stories, La pequeña Gyaros (“Little Gyaros”), in 1932, but his reputation was established with two novellas, Sombras suele vestir (1941) and Las ratas (1943), published in English as Shadow Play, The Rats: Two Novellas by José Bianco. The Rats is a psychological novel, with a complicated but flawlessly constructed plot that leads to the poisoning of the protagonist. Bianco’s narrator has a complicated psychological makeup that is elegantly drawn, and the plot develops inexorably yet unexpectedly to the surprising ending. Shadow Play is a fantastic tale in the manner of Borges and Bioy Casares, written in a classic, unobtrusive style that allows for the unsettling of reality to occur almost unnoticed by the reader. The novella was included in the Antología de la literatura fantástica (1977; “Anthology of Fantastic Literature,” translated as The Book of Fantasy), published by Borges, Silvina Ocampo, and Bioy Casares.
Bianco also published criticism, memoirs, and the long novel La pérdida del reino (1978; “Loss of the Kingdom”), but his fame rests on the two novellas and his association with Sur and the writers surrounding it.
