Ring Lardner, original name Ringgold Wilmer Lardner,  (born March 6, 1885, Niles, Mich., U.S.—died Sept. 25, 1933, East Hampton, N.Y.), American writer, one of the most gifted, as well as the most bitter, satirists in the United States and a fine storyteller with a true ear for the vernacular.
Lardner came from a well-to-do family, although his father lost most of his fortune during Lardner’s last year in high school. He attended Armour Institute of Technology in Chicago for one term and then worked at a series of jobs before beginning his writing career in 1905 as a reporter for the South Bend Times in Indiana. He went on to newspapers in Chicago, where he established a reputation as a sportswriter specializing in baseball stories. From 1913 to 1919 he wrote a daily column, “In the Wake of the News,” for the Chicago Tribune and from 1919 to 1927 a humorous weekly column for the Bell Syndicate. Meanwhile, in 1914, he had begun publishing fiction and had won success with stories featuring the character Jack Keefe, a comic baseball player, some of which were collected in You Know Me Al (1916).
Lardner moved to New York in 1919, and the scope of his stories spread beyond the baseball diamond. He first attracted critical interest with his collection How to Write Short Stories (1924). Some of Lardner’s best stories—“My Roomy,” “Champion,” “The Golden Honeymoon,” and “Some Like Them Cold”—appeared in the 1924 collection. Equally good was his next: The Love Nest and Other Stories (1926), with its notable title story (dramatized by Robert E. Sherwood in 1927), “A Day with Conrad Green,” and “Haircut.” Selected Stories was published in 1997.
Lardner contracted tuberculosis and was in and out of hospitals during his last seven years, turning his hand to all manner of writing to support his family. He collaborated on two plays that had Broadway runs: Elmer the Great (1928) with George M. Cohan and June Moon (1929) with George S. Kaufman. His spoof autobiography, The Story of a Wonder Man, appeared in 1927.
Lardner’s son Ring Lardner, Jr. (1915–2000), was a satiric screenwriter who won Oscars for Woman of the Year (1942) and M*A*S*H (1970). A member of the Hollywood Ten, he was jailed (1950–51) and blacklisted because of allegations that he was a communist.
