Winthrop Ames,  (born Nov. 25, 1870, North Easton, Mass., U.S.—died  Nov. 3, 1937, Boston), American theatrical producer, manager, director, and occasional playwright known for some of the finest productions of plays in the United States during the first three decades of the 20th century.
Though his interests lay in the theatre, to please his family Ames entered the publishing business for a few years after completing his education in 1896. He traveled to Europe in 1907, however, to study the management of more than 60 opera and theatrical companies. He returned to Boston and became known for his experiments with the stock company there. His innovative approach to stagecraft reflected his study of the new European art theatre movement, but the company had little financial success.
In 1908 he became managing director of the New Theatre, largest in New York and intended to house a repertory company producing the very finest in drama, free from commercial pressures. Opening on Nov. 6, 1909, with Antony and Cleopatra, Ames went on to produce The Blue Bird by Maurice Maeterlinck, John Galsworthy’s Strife, and others—Twelfth Night, The Winter’s Tale, and The School for Scandal—over a two-year period. The plays received much praise, but costs of production were too high and the theatre closed.
Ames then bought the Little Theatre in New York and the Booth Theatre. Productions in the two theatres, which he managed into the 1930s, included The Philanderer (1913), by George Bernard Shaw, Galsworthy’s Old English (1924), George S. Kaufman and Marc Connelly’s Beggar on Horseback (1924), an extremely successful series of Gilbert and Sullivan revivals at the Booth (1926–29), and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1913), the first play designed especially for children and which Ames himself wrote under a pseudonym. Ames also directed the plays he produced. He retired in 1932 because of ill health.
