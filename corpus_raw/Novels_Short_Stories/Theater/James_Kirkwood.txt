James Kirkwood,  (born Aug. 22, 1924,  Los Angeles, Calif., U.S.—died April 21, 1989, New York, N.Y.), American librettist, actor, author, and playwright who, together with Nicholas Dante, wrote the text for the Broadway musical A Chorus Line (1975), which in 1983 became the longest-running musical in the history of Broadway. It held the record until 1997, when it was surpassed by Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Cats.
As the son of silent film stars Lila Lee and James Kirkwood, the young Kirkwood followed his parents into show business, appearing on Broadway in Junior Miss, Small Wonder, and Welcome Darlings and in such films as Oh God, Book II (1980) and Mommie Dearest (1981). For A Chorus Line, a story about dancers auditioning for a musical, Kirkwood won both a Tony Award and a Pulitzer Prize in 1976. He also wrote such plays as U.T.B.U. (1965; “Unhealthy to Be Unpleasant”) and the comedy Legends (1986). Among his books are There Must Be a Pony! (1960), Good Times/Bad Times (1968), P.S. Your Cat Is Dead (1972), Hit Me with a Rainbow (1980), and Diary of a Mad Playwright (1989).
