George Mackay Brown,  (born Oct. 17, 1921, Stromness, Orkney Islands, Scot.—died April 13, 1996, Kirkwall, Orkney Islands), Scottish writer who celebrated Orkneyan life and its ancient rhythms in verse, short stories, and novels.
Brown was the son of a Gaelic-speaking Highlander and an Orkney postman. He studied at Newbattle Abbey College, near Edinburgh, where Orkney poet Edwin Muir encouraged him to develop his craft. Muir published Brown’s first collection of poetry, The Storm, in 1954. After graduating from the University of Edinburgh, Brown returned to Stromness, his beloved fishing village. From that vantage point he captured the struggles and simple pleasure of island life and its mythic origins. His collections of poetry include Loaves and Fishes (1959) and The Year of the Whale (1965). His well-regarded short stories are collected in such volumes as A Calendar of Love (1967) and A Time to Keep (1969). His novels include Magnus (1973), Time in a Red Coat (1984), and Beside the Ocean of Time (1994); the last-mentioned was short-listed for the Booker Prize. He also collaborated with the composer Peter Maxwell Davies on a number of musical works. For the Islands I Sing (1997), his autobiography, was published posthumously, as was the short-story collection The Island of the Women and Other Stories (1998).
