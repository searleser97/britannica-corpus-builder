Mary Austin, née Mary Hunter,  (born Sept. 9, 1868, Carlinville, Ill., U.S.—died  Aug. 13, 1934, Santa Fe, N.M.), novelist and essayist who wrote about Native American culture and social problems.
Mary Hunter graduated from Blackburn College in 1888 and soon afterward moved with her family to Bakersfield, California. She married Stafford W. Austin in 1891, and for several years they lived in various towns in California’s Owens Valley. Mary Austin soon learned to love the desert and the Native Americans who lived in it, and both figured in the sketches that constituted her first book, The Land of Little Rain (1903), which was a great and immediate success. It was followed by a collection of stories, The Basket Woman (1904), a romantic novel, Isidro (1905), and a collection of regional sketches, The Flock (1906).
In 1905 Austin separated from her husband and moved to Carmel, California. She later traveled to Italy, France, and England, where meeting H.G. Wells and other intellectuals strengthened her feminist ideas and added a strong commitment to socialism to her own deeply personal and sustaining form of mysticism. Returning to New York City, she became associated with John Reed, Walter Lippmann, and others of the group of writers and artists whose centre was Mabel Dodge Luhan. A play, The Arrow Maker (1911), and her best novel, A Woman of Genius (1912), were the product of those New York years, as were scores of rather didactic articles on socialism, women’s rights, and a variety of other topics and such novels as The Ford (1917) and No. 26 Jayne Street (1920).
In 1924 Austin settled in Santa Fe, New Mexico. That year she published The Land of Journeys’ Ending and followed it with, among other books, Everyman’s Genius (1925), The Children Sing in the Far West (1928; like her earlier The American Rhythm [1923], a collection of Native American songs and original poems inspired by them), Starry Adventure (1931), Experiences Facing Death (1931), and an autobiography, Earth Horizon (1932).
Austin’s best writing, which is concerned with nature or Native American life, is reminiscent of the work of Ralph Waldo Emerson and John Muir in its transcendental tone and occasional primitivist leaning. She was active in movements to preserve Native American arts, crafts, and culture.
