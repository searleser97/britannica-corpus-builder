Bozorg Alavi, also spelled Buzurg Alavī,  (born February 2, 1904, Tehrān, Iran—died February 18, 1997, Berlin, Germany), one of the leading prose writers of 20th-century Persian literature.
Alavi was educated in Iran, and in 1922 he was sent to Berlin, where he learned German and translated a number of German works into Persian. Upon returning to Iran, he taught at the Industrial College of Tehrān and became involved with a group of Iranian socialists. He was imprisoned with them from 1937 to 1941, and while in jail he wrote Panjāh va seh nafar (“Fifty-three People”), describing the members of the socialist group and their ordeal in prison, and the short-story collection Varaq-pārahā-yē zendān (“Notes from Prison”).
After World War II, Alavi moved closer to Soviet communism and visited the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic, about which he wrote an account, Uzbakhā (“The Uzbeks”). He was also a founder of the communist Tudeh Party of Iran. He published another collection of stories, Nāmahʾhā (“Letters”), in 1952. After the fall of the Iranian prime minister Mohammed Mosaddeq in 1954, Alavi left Iran and took a post as visiting professor at the Humboldt University of Berlin in East Germany.
Alavi is best known for his short-story collection Chamadān (1964; “Baggage” or “The Suitcase”), in which he exhibits the strong influence of Freudian psychology, and for his novel Chashmhāyash (1952; Her Eyes), an extremely controversial work about an underground revolutionary leader and the upper-class woman who loves him. Alavi also wrote a number of works in German, among them, Kämpfendes Iran (1955; “The Struggle of Iran”) and Geschichte und Entwicklung der modernen Persischen Literatur (1964; “The History and Development of Modern Persian Literature”).
Alavi returned to Iran for a brief period following the revolution of 1979 but later resumed his professorship in East Germany. In 1985 The Prison Papers of Bozorg Alavi: A Literary Odyssey was published.
