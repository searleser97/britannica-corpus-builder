Claudio Magris,  (born April 10, 1939, Trieste, Italy), Italian writer, scholar, and critic who was one of the leading writers and cultural philosophers of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.
Magris completed his studies at the University of Turin, where he also taught from 1970 to 1978. Thereafter he taught German literature at the University of Trieste. His numerous studies have promoted central European culture and the literature of the “Habsburg myth.” He translated works by Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen as well as works by Heinrich von Kleist, Arthur Schnitzler, and many other German-language writers. Among his numerous essay collections are Lontano da dove: Joseph Roth e la tradizione ebraico-orientale (1971; “Far from Where: Joseph Roth and the Oriental Hebrew Tradition”), Itaca e oltre (1982; “Ithaca and Beyond”), and L’anello di Clarisse: grande stile e nichilismo nella letteratura moderna (1984; “Clarisse’s Ring: Tradition and Nihilism in the Modern Literature”). His novels—including Danubio (1986; Danube), Un altro mare (1991; A Different Sea), and Microcosmi (1997, winner of the Strega Prize; Microcosms)—explore many of the same topics as his essays. In 2004 Magris won the Prince of Asturias Award for Letters. His later works include Alla cieca (2005; Blindly), Lei dunque capirà (2006; “[And] Then She’ll Understand”), and Non luogo a procedere (2015; Blameless).
