Paul Muldoon,  (born June 20, 1951, County Armagh, Northern Ireland), Northern Irish poet whose oeuvre covered both intensely personal and political terrain—from his wife’s miscarriage to the conflict in Northern Ireland.
Muldoon’s father was a labourer and gardener, and his mother was a schoolteacher. He began writing poems in his teenage years and went on to study at Queen’s University, Belfast, where he was tutored by poet and Nobel laureate Seamus Heaney. At age 19 he completed his first collection of poems, Knowing My Place (1971). He graduated in 1973 and then worked for BBC Belfast as a radio and television producer until 1986. Following the death of his father in 1987, Muldoon immigrated to the United States. He and his family settled in Princeton, New Jersey, where he taught creative writing and became Howard G.B. Clark ’21 Professor in the Humanities and chair of both the Fund for Irish Studies and the Lewis Center for the Arts at Princeton University. He also served as honorary professor of poetry (1999–2004) at the University of Oxford, and in 2007–17 he was poetry editor of The New Yorker.
Some of Muldoon’s poetry explored elaborate imaginary encounters between historical figures, including one between Lord Byron and Thomas Jefferson. Muldoon challenged himself to work within tight poetic forms such as haiku, sestina, and sonnet. He suggested that he intentionally wrote poems that seemed spontaneous and clear at first but that revealed deeper significances upon closer inspection. Muldoon’s many collections included Meeting the British (1987), Madoc: A Mystery (1990), The Annals of Chile (1994), New Selected Poems, 1968–94 (1996), Hay (1998), Poems 1968–1998 (2001), Plan B (2009, a collaboration with the photographer Norman McBeath), Maggot (2010), The Word on the Street: Rock Lyrics (2013), One Thousand Things Worth Knowing (2015), and Frolic and Detour (2019). Moy Sand and Gravel (2002) reaped both the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry and the Griffin Poetry Prize for an international writer in 2003.
Muldoon published poetry criticism, including The End of the Poem (2006). He also collaborated with the American songwriter Warren Zevon on the album My Ride’s Here (2002) and wrote the librettos for operas by the American composer Daron Hagen, including Vera of Las Vegas (2001). Among his other works were the children’s books The Last Thesaurus (1995) and Reverse Flannery (2003), the teleplay Monkeys (1989, directed by Danny Boyle), and several anthologies of poetry.
