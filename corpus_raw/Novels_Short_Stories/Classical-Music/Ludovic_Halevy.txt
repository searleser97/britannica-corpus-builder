Ludovic Halévy,  (born Jan. 1, 1834, Paris, Fr.—died May 8, 1908, Paris), French librettist and novelist who, in collaboration with Henri Meilhac, wrote the librettos for most of the operettas of Jacques Offenbach and who also wrote satiric comedies about contemporary Parisian life.
The son of the writer Léon Halévy and the nephew of the operatic composer Fromental Halévy, Ludovic began writing for the stage while still a member of the French civil service. His first real success was his anonymous collaboration on the libretto for Offenbach’s operetta Orphée aux enfers (1858; “Orpheus in the Underworld”). In 1861 he began a literary partnership with Meilhac that lasted 20 years and that would produce a series of humorous and witty works that epitomized the spirit and mores of the Second Empire even while making fun of them. Together the two men wrote the librettos for Offenbach’s operettas La Belle Hélène (1864), Barbe-bleue (1866; “Bluebeard”), La Vie Parisienne (1866; “Parisian Life”), and La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein (1867), all highly popular works in their day. These works’ scripts are characterized by buffoonery, farce, and the light and ironic mockery of society. Halévy and Meilhac also wrote the libretto for Georges Bizet’s opera Carmen (1875). Among the best of their entertaining drawing-room comedies are Fanny (1868) and Froufrou (1869).
Halévy himself was also a skilled writer of novels and short stories. The best of his fiction includes La Famille Cardinal (1883), a study of lower-class Parisian life during the early years of the Third Republic, and the sentimental novel L’Abbé Constantin (1882), which was a huge success with the public. He was elected to the Académie Française in 1884.
