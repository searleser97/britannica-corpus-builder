Demyan Bedny, byname of Yefim Alekseyevich Pridvorov,  (born April 13 [April 1, Old Style], 1883, Gubovka, Ukraine, Russian Empire—died  May 25, 1945, Barvikha, near Moscow), Soviet poet known both for his verses glorifying the Revolution of 1917 and for his satirical fables.
The natural son of a grand duke, Pridvorov began contributing to the socialist press before the Revolution, adopting the name Demyan Bedny (“Demyan the Poor”). In 1912 his satires started to appear. His style was influenced by the 19th-century Russian fabulist Ivan Krylov; his verses often took the form of popular songs and “factory couplets” (a kind of workers’ slogan or cheer). Between 1917 and 1930 Bedny was highly popular with the general public, and Lenin himself, while noting their crudeness, lauded their propaganda value. Many of his works, however, were topical, and time diminished their appeal.
In 1936 Bedny composed a new libretto for the comic opera Bogatyri (“Heroes”) by Aleksandr Borodin; and his verse text, in the spirit of the original music, satirized Russian history and its epic heroes. Although Bedny had been a longtime favourite of Stalin, the dictator now personally berated him for his cynicism and lack of respect. In 1938 he was expelled from the Communist Party. Even the patriotic verses he wrote during World War II, which were extremely popular among the soldiers, did not regain for him his former status. Only in the 1960s, well after his death, was official approval of Bedny’s works revived, and he is now regarded as an outstanding communist poet, although his popularity with the public remains limited.
