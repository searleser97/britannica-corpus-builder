Juliette Augusta Magill Kinzie, née Juliette Augusta Magill,  (born September 11, 1806, Middletown, Connecticut, U.S.—died September 15, 1870, Amagansett, New York), American pioneer and writer, remembered for her accounts of the indigenous peoples and settlers of early Chicago and the Midwest.
Juliette Magill was educated at home, in a New Haven, Connecticut, boarding school, and briefly at Emma Willard’s Troy (New York) Female Seminary. In 1830 she married John H. Kinzie, son of Chicago pioneer John Kinzie and himself an Indian agent at Fort Winnebago (now in Wisconsin but then still part of Michigan Territory). They lived at Fort Winnebago until 1834, when they moved to Chicago. In that newly incorporated town Juliette Kinzie quickly became a social and cultural leader.
In 1844 she published anonymously a Narrative of the Massacre at Chicago, an account of the 1812 Fort Dearborn massacre that she compiled from Kinzie family records and reminiscences. Her version of the event soon became the standard and accepted one. It was amplified and included in her major written work, Wau-bun: The “Early Days” in the North-west (1856), which combined travel accounts and personal experiences of her early years at Fort Winnebago, including the Black Hawk War of 1832, with Native American legends, further early history of Chicago, and particularly the story of John Kinzie. The book, a valuable if imperfectly reliable picture of the period, was a considerable success in its day and has continued to be reprinted. It was largely responsible for fixing the reputation of John Kinzie as a founding father of Chicago. In 1869 Juliette Kinzie published Walter Ogilby, a novel. Mark Logan, the Bourgeois, also a novel, appeared posthumously in 1887. She died in 1870 as the result of a pharmacist’s error.
