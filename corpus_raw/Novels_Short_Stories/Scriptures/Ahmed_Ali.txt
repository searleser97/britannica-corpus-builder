Ahmed Ali,  (born July 1, 1910, Delhi, India—died January 14, 1994, Karachi, Pakistan), Pakistani author whose novels and short stories examine Islamic culture and tradition in Hindu-dominated India. Proficient in both English and Urdu, he was also an accomplished translator and literary critic.
Ali was educated at Aligarh Muslim University (1925–27) and at Lucknow University (B.A., 1930; M.A., 1931). In addition to his career as a writer, he was a professor, a diplomat, and a businessman. In 1932 he helped publish Angarey (“Burning Coals”), an anthology of short stories written in Urdu that was immediately banned for its bitter critique of middle-class Muslim values. Subsequently, he became a founder of the All-India Progressive Writers Association (1936), which promoted innovation in Urdu literature. His influential short fiction—collected in such volumes as Sholay (1936; “The Flames”) and Hamari gali (1942; “Our Lane”)—is characterized by its sense of realism and social awareness and by its use of stream of consciousness.
Ali earned international acclaim with the publication of his first novel, Twilight in Delhi (1940), which was written in English. It nostalgically chronicles the passing of the traditional Muslim aristocracy in light of encroaching British colonialism in the early 20th century. His second novel, Ocean of Night (1964), examines the cultural rift in India that preceded the creation of India and Pakistan in 1947. Like Ocean of Night, Of Rats and Diplomats (1984) was written decades before its publication. It is a satiric novel about a diplomat whose ratlike tail is the physical manifestation of his moral dissolution. Ali’s other notable works include Purple Gold Mountain (1960), a volume of verse, and The Prison House (1985), a collection of short stories. Ali published a contemporary bilingual (English and Urdu) translation of the Qurʾān in 1988. In 1992 he released a revised edition of his anthology of Urdu poetry in English translation, The Golden Tradition (the original edition was published in 1973).
