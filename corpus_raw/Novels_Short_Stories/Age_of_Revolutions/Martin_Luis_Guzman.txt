Martín Luis Guzmán,  (born October 6, 1887, Chihuahua, Mexico—died December 22, 1976, Mexico City), novelist who was one of the finest writers of the revolutionary period in Mexico.
After studying law at the National Autonomous University of Mexico in Mexico City, Guzmán joined the Mexican Revolution and served as a colonel in the revolutionary forces of Pancho Villa. From 1914 to 1934, he lived in exile in Madrid and New York City, where he was editor of the periodical El gráfico (“The Graphic”). His experiences in the revolution were recorded in his volume of memoirs (which has also been called both a novel and a chronicle), El águila y la serpiente (1928; The Eagle and the Serpent), which is admired in part for its insights into the personalities of those who shaped the revolution. According to one knowledgeable critic, The Eagle and the Serpent is Guzman’s masterpiece and reflects his quest for “the essence of the Mexican national identity.” He is also famous for his novel La sombra del caudillo (1929; “The Shadow of the Leader”), in which he depicted the political corruption of the 1920s in Mexico. His other major works include Memorias de Pancho Villa (1940; Memoirs of Pancho Villa), Mina el mozo, héroe de Navarra (1932; “Mina the Youth, Hero of Navarre”), Muertes históricas (1958; “Historical Deaths”), and Crónicas de mi destierro (1963; “Chronicles of My Exile”).
