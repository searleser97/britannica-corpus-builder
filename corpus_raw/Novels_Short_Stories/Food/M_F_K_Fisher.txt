M.F.K. Fisher, in full Mary Frances Kennedy Fisher,  (born July 3, 1908, Albion, Mich., U.S.—died June 22, 1992, Glen Ellen, Calif.), American writer whose compelling style, wit, and interest in the gastronomical made her one of the major American writers on the subject of food. In her 15 celebrated books, Fisher created a new genre: the food essay. Seeing food as a cultural metaphor, she proved to be both an insightful philosopher of food and a writer of fine prose.
Kennedy was reared in Whittier, California, and became accomplished in the kitchen. She married in 1929 and moved to Dijon, France, where she reveled in French cooking and culture. Her first book of essays celebrating food, Serve It Forth, was published in 1937. Her other early works include Consider the Oyster (1941) and How to Cook a Wolf (1942), in which she encourages readers to make the most of whatever they can afford.
While all of Fisher’s books were well received, critics point to The Gastronomical Me (1943) as one of her best early efforts. Her 1949 translation of French gastronomist Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin’s The Physiology of Taste is regarded as the definitive English version. An Alphabet for Gourmets (1949) is superbly witty, and A Cordiall Water (1961), a discourse on folk remedies, became something of a cult classic. She also consulted with chef Julia Child on a 1968 Provençal cookbook.
Fisher settled in California in the 1950s. Her belief that the kitchen is a measure of the soul informed her life and work. She continued to cook and to write even after Parkinson’s disease made it difficult for her to do so. Her 1971 memoir, Among Friends, details her early years. Her later works include Sister Age (1983), a meditation on growing older, and The Boss Dog (1991), a book for children.
