J.R. Ackerley, in full Joe Randolph Ackerley,  (born Nov. 4, 1896, Herne Hill, Kent, Eng.—died  June 4, 1967, Putney, near London), British novelist, dramatist, poet, and magazine editor known for his eccentricity.
Ackerley’s education was interrupted by his service in World War I, during which he was captured and imprisoned for eight months in Germany. He graduated from Magdalen College, Cambridge, in 1921. He examined his wartime experiences in the play The Prisoners of War (1925). A five-month position as private secretary to an Indian maharaja in 1923 provided the material for his humorous Hindoo Holiday: An Indian Journal (1932).
Ackerley joined the British Broadcasting Corporation in 1928; from 1935 to 1959 he was the literary editor of Listener, the company’s weekly magazine. Although he published very little himself while at the BBC, he forged close relationships with many of London’s literati, most notably with E.M. Forster; his E.M. Forster: A Portrait was published in 1970. But, according to Ackerley, his most prized relationship was with his dog; he wrote tenderly of this platonic love affair in My Dog Tulip (1956). Ackerley often claimed that he was incapable of invention, and his writing is most noted for its uncensored honesty and obsession with the truth, including frank comments on his homosexual relationships. Drawing largely on personal experience, the comic novel We Think the World of You (1960) is the strange tale of a man’s love for his lover’s dog. Ackerley’s autobiography, My Father and Myself (published posthumously, 1968), describes the remarkable double life of his father, a prosperous banana importer who secretly maintained two families in separate locations. A posthumous collection of Ackerley’s correspondence was published as The Ackerley Letters (1975).
