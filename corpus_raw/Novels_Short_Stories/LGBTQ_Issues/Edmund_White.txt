Edmund White, in full Edmund Valentine White III,  (born January 13, 1940, Cincinnati, Ohio, U.S.), American writer of novels, short fiction, and nonfiction whose critically acclaimed work focuses on male homosexual society in America. His studies of evolving attitudes toward homosexuality and of the impact of HIV/AIDS on homosexual communities in the United States were significant contributions to contemporary sociological and social history.
White and his older sister were born to a father who sold industrial equipment and a mother who was a child psychologist. His parents divorced when he was seven, and he moved with his mother and sister to Evanston, Illinois. After attending boarding school in Michigan, he enrolled at the University of Michigan, where he received a bachelor’s degree in Chinese in 1962. Though White had been admitted to Harvard University to continue his study of Chinese, he instead followed a male lover to New York City. He immersed himself in the gay culture burgeoning in the city at the time; notably, he was present at the 1969 Stonewall riots. He worked as a staff writer for Time-Life Books (1962–70), as a senior editor at the Saturday Review (1972–73), and as an associate editor at Horizon (1974–75).
White published his first novel, Forgetting Elena, in 1973. It is a biting satire that uses the perspective of an innocent young man to reveal the intricate manners and rituals of homosexual life on Fire Island, New York. That effort and its successors established White as among the foremost voices in gay fiction. The elegaic Nocturnes for the King of Naples (1978) recalls an affair after the elder of the two lovers has died. As the scourge of HIV/AIDS descended upon homosexual men, killing many of White’s friends, in 1981 he and others, including playwright Larry Kramer, formed the Gay Men’s Health Crisis, an organization devoted to helping victims of the disease. After receiving a Guggenheim fellowship (for which he was recommended by friend Susan Sontag), White moved to Paris in 1983; he remained there until 1990 and frequently returned thereafter. He discovered that he was HIV-positive in 1985 and became one of the few public figures who became infected with the disease to speak openly about the diagnosis.
That year, signifying his intent to survive the disease and continue working, he issued the bizarrely comic Caracole, about the bacchanalian escapades of the denizens of an imagined city. Some of White’s short fiction was collected as Skinned Alive (1995), in which he related tales of homosexual love, thwarted and requited, in the coruscating prose that was his trademark. With the publication of the novel The Farewell Symphony in 1997, he completed an autobiographical trilogy that includes A Boy’s Own Story (1982) and The Beautiful Room Is Empty (1988). The Married Man (2000) draws upon White’s own romantic experience in its tale of an older HIV-positive furniture expert and his love affair with a younger man who ultimately dies of AIDS. Fanny: A Fiction (2003) is a historical novel about feminist Frances Wright and novelist Frances Trollope (mother of Anthony Trollope). Later fiction includes Chaos: A Novella and Stories (2007), Hotel de Dream (2007), Jack Holmes and His Friend (2012), Our Young Man (2016), and A Saint from Texas (2020). White also wrote several plays, notably Terre Haute (2006), about an imagined encounter between characters based on Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh and writer Gore Vidal.
His nonfiction efforts include the seminal sex manual The Joy of Gay Sex (1977; with Charles Silverstein). States of Desire: Travels in Gay America (1980) is a travelogue that investigates gay culture in cities across the United States. White paid homage to his adopted city of Paris in Our Paris: Sketches from Memory (1994), a collaboration with his lover, illustrator Hubert Sorin, that paid homage to the neighbourhood in which they lived before Sorin died of AIDS in 1994, and in The Flâneur: A Stroll Through the Paradoxes of Paris (2001), a meditation on the city’s character with digressions on some of its more-obscure attractions.Arts and Letters (2004) collected some of White’s writings on and interviews with a range of cultural figures. He wrote the biographies Genet (1993), Marcel Proust (1998), and Rimbaud: The Double Life of a Rebel (2008). Selections of his essays and reviews were published as The Burning Library: Essays on Art, Politics and Sexuality 1969–1993 (1994) and Sacred Monsters (2011). Among his memoirs are My Lives (2005), City Boy: My Life in New York During the 1960s and ’70s (2009), Inside a Pearl: My Years in Paris (2014), and The Unpunished Vice: A Life of Reading (2018); the latter also includes essays.
White was assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University (1977–79), adjunct professor at the Columbia University School of the Arts (1980–82), and professor at Brown University (1990–92). In 1998 he joined the faculty at Princeton University, becoming professor emeritus in 2018. He also served as director of the New York Institute for the Humanities (1981–84) and directed the creative writing program at Princeton in 2002–06. His work was often published in periodicals such as Mother Jones and Architectural Digest. He was appointed to the French L’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 1993, to the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1996, and to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1999. In 2016 he was named state author of New York. Two years later he received the PEN/Saul Bellow Award for Achievement in American Fiction.
