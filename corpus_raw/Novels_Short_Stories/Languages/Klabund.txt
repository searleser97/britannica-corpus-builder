Klabund, pseudonym of Alfred Henschke,  (born November 4, 1890, Crossen, Germany [now Krosno Odrzańskie, Poland]—died August 14, 1928, Davos, Switzerland), Expressionist poet, playwright, and novelist who adapted and translated works from Chinese, Japanese, Persian, and other non-Western literatures into German. His free, imaginative renderings include Der Kreidekreis (1924; The Circle of Chalk), a drama that inspired the German playwright Bertolt Brecht to write his play Der kaukasische Kreidekreis (The Caucasian Chalk Circle).
A consumptive who spent many years in sanatoriums, Henschke identified with the eternally seeking wandering poet and called himself Klabund, a name derived from Klabautermann (“hobgoblin”) and Vagabund (“vagabond”). Restlessness and versatility characterize his work. He composed poetry in a variety of forms, and he created a new prose form, the “Expressionist novella.” Notable in this genre are his autobiographical “novels of longing,” with themes of sickness and love; biographical “novels of passion,” with sensual portraits of historical figures (e.g., Pjotr [1923; Peter the Czar]); and his greatest achievements in prose, the two “novels of fulfillment” Bracke (1918; Brackie, the Fool) and Borgia (1928; The Incredible Borgias). Li-tai-pe (1916) and Lao-tse (1921) are also among his works.
