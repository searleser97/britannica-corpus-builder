Jaime Torres Bodet,  (born April 17, 1902, Mexico City, Mex.—died  May 13, 1974, Mexico City), Mexican poet, novelist, educator, and statesman.
Torres Bodet studied law and literature at the National University of Mexico. He later became secretary to the National Preparatory School, then chief of the department of public libraries in the Ministry of Education (1922–24), and was professor of French literature at the university (1924–29).
His first collection of verse, Fervor (1918), revealed Modernist tendencies. The theme of loneliness, his search for identity, and a longing for death expressed in these poems all foreshadowed the poet’s later work. El corazón delirante (1922; “The Delirious Heart”) and Canciones (1922; “Songs”) included highly lyrical love poems. In La casa (1923; “The House”), he strove for clarity and examined the theme of the constant renewal of life in poems that reflected the influence of the Spanish poet Juan Ramón Jiménez. Los días (1923; “The Days”) stressed the poet’s anguish at a dehumanized environment. He employed Japanese verse forms in Biombo (1925; “The Folding Screen”). He was the first editor (1928–31) of Contemporáneos, a cultural and literary magazine influential among Mexican poets.
Destierro (1930; “Exile”), written shortly after he became secretary to the Mexican legation in Madrid, reflected the poet’s attempt, often expressed in complex surrealist imagery, to rebel against a mechanized, hostile, and unfamiliar environment. Cripta (1937; “Crypt”), considered to include his most important poems, dealt with basic human concerns and revealed in compact, powerful language a preoccupation with time, solitude, and the absurdity of life.
After holding various diplomatic posts in Europe and at home, Torres Bodet became minister of public education (1943–46) and foreign minister (1946–48). He led the Mexican delegation to the United Nations preparatory commission (1945) and to the first sessions of the United Nations (1947). In 1948 he was one of the drafters of the charter of the Organization of American States. He served as director general of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) from 1948 to 1952.
In Fronteras (1954; “Frontiers”) and Sin tregua (1957; “Without Truce”), the mature poet dwelt on the isolation prevalent in modern society. Torres Bodet also wrote much prose, including highly acclaimed essays on Marcel Proust and Leo Tolstoy; and in 1966 he was awarded the National Prize for Literature for a study of Rubén Darío. Of the six novels published between 1927 and 1937, Sombras (1937; “Shadows”) is considered his best. Obra poética (1967; “Poetical Work”) is a two-volume edition of his poetry. Selected Poems of Jaime Torres Bodet (1964) is a bilingual edition. Afflicted by cancer, Torres Bodet took his own life.
