John Munonye,  (born April 28, 1929, Akokwa, British Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria [now in Imo state, Nigeria]—died May 10, 1999), Igbo educator and novelist known for his ability to capture the vitality of the contemporary Nigerian scene.
Munonye was educated at Christ the King College in Onitsha (1943–48) and attended the University of Ibadan, graduating in 1952. He worked for the Nigerian Ministry of Education until 1977, when he left to teach and devote more time to writing.
Munonye’s novels are animated by the clash between African traditions and European beliefs. In The Only Son (1966), Munonye’s first novel, a widowed mother navigates traditional expectations for Igbo women as she raises her son, who then attends a Western-oriented school and converts to Christianity. Obi (1969), a sequel to The Only Son, broadens the theme to an extended family. In both books the family emerges as a source of strength in times of turmoil. Munonye’s later novels include Oil Man of Obange (1971) and A Wreath for the Maidens (1973). His novel A Dancer of Fortune (1974) is a satire of modern Nigerian business. Munonye returned to the family of his first two novels in Bridge to a Wedding (1978). Thereafter he published little.
