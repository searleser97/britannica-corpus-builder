Dorothy Canfield Fisher, original name Dorothea Frances Canfield, pen name Dorothy Canfield,  (born February 17, 1879, Lawrence, Kansas, U.S.—died November 9, 1958, Arlington, Vermont), prolific American author of novels, short stories, children’s books, educational works, and memoirs.
Canfield received a Ph.D. in Romance languages from Columbia University in 1904, a rare accomplishment for a woman of her generation. In 1907 she married John Redwood Fisher and, under the pen name Dorothy Canfield, published her first novel, Gunhild. In the same year, she inherited her great-grandfather’s farm in Arlington, Vermont; the town appears (often with the skimpiest of literary veils) in many of her works, including Hillsboro People (1915), written with poet Sarah N. Cleghorn, and The Bent Twig (1915).
In 1912 Fisher met Maria Montessori in Italy and was impressed by the educator’s theories. A Montessori Mother (1912), The Montessori Manual (1913), and Mothers and Children (1914) are the results of their friendship. Her experiences in French clinics and war camps resulted in three volumes of short stories, including Home Fires in France (1918).
After returning to the United States, Fisher translated Giovanni Papini’s Life of Christ (1923) and during the 1920s and ’30s produced a string of marriage-and-family stories and novels. Her Son’s Wife (1926) is one of the best regarded of her longer works; the story of a perfectionist mother who learns to accept her son’s ill-bred wife, it may contain her best characterization. In the 1940s and ’50s, Fisher worked for numerous environmental, children’s, and educational causes and also wrote several historical children’s books, including Paul Revere and the Minute Men (1950).
