Kenneth Koch,  (born February 27, 1925, Cincinnati, Ohio, U.S.—died July 6, 2002, New York, New York), American teacher and author noted especially for his witty, often surreal, sometimes epic, poetry. He was also an accomplished playwright.
Koch attended Harvard University (B.A., 1948) and Columbia University (M.A., 1953; Ph.D., 1959), where he subsequently taught for many years. With the publication of Poems (1953), his first collection, he became one of the leading poets of the so-called New York school, a loose-knit group that included poets Frank O’Hara and John Ashbery. Allied with the Abstract Expressionist painters, these poets worked in a deliberately antitraditional style. Koch’s work was noted for its rather whimsical humour and unusual juxtapositions.
Koch wrote two Byronic epics in ottava rima: Ko; or, A Season on Earth (1959), a complex, comic tale of continent-hopping characters, and The Duplications (1977). These were later published together, with a long preface also in ottava rima, as Seasons on Earth (1987). He also wrote Sleeping with Women (1969) and the long prose poem The Burning Mystery of Anna in 1951 (1979), as well as many shorter verses, including those collected in Selected Poems 1950–82 (1991). In 1994 he published two collections, On the Great Atlantic Rainway: Selected Poems 1950–1988 and One Train. He received the Bollingen Prize in Poetry in 1995.
Two dozen of Koch’s plays, which are often short, and 10 of his screenplays were collected in A Change of Hearts: Plays, Films, and Other Dramatic Works 1951–1971 (1973). His other drama collections include One Thousand Avant-Garde Plays (1988) and The Gold Standard (1996). Koch is noted for teaching poetry writing and appreciation to children and retirees, as described in his books Wishes, Lies, and Dreams: Teaching Children to Write Poetry (1970), Rose, Where Did You Get That Red? Teaching Great Poetry to Children (1973), and I Never Told Anybody: Teaching Poetry Writing in a Nursing Home (1977). Among his works of prose are the short stories of Hotel Lambosa (1993) and Making Your Own Days: The Pleasures of Reading and Writing Poetry (1998).
